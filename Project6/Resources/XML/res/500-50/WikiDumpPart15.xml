The '''lymphatic system''' includes lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and lymph. The lymph contains many lymphocytes, which are a type of leukocyte, white blood cell, or immune cell. The lymphatic system contributes greatly to ridding an organism of foreign invasion. The invader can be bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, or toxins. If an invasion gets out of control, it can lead to an infection, which the lymphatic system then plays a roll in subduing.

The lymph nodes will swell when combating an infection, often being one of the confirming signs of illness due to a foreign organism.

Lymph drains through the lymph system in the direction of venous blood flow (towards the heart).  It is pumped by the gross muscular movement of the body as it squeezes the intercellular spaces where the lymph moves.

People who have had cancerous tissue removed will often have lymph nodes removed as well to check for spreading of the cancer.  After such removal the person must be careful to avoid injury to the body along that route of lymph as the immune response to infection is impaired (e.g. a mastectomy on the left side with removal of lymph nodes means that arm needs to be treated with caution).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PENGUIN LOVING ==
''Compared with other birds, emperor penguins have everything backwards.  They breed in winter, the females compete for the males, and they’re notoriously unfaithful. They’re the most bizarre birds I’ve ever met.''
:-Ann Bowles in the article “Emperors of the Ice.&quot;
	
Emperor penguins, ''Aptenodytes forsteri'', are the largest of the penguin family.  They live in harsh environments of the Antarctic, battered by extreme weather conditions and vicious predators, and are the only warm-blooded animal to winter on the open ice.  It is therefore no surprise that these birds present unique behaviors.  The mating and brooding habits of these penguins reflect how these penguins have adapted to overcome these formidable obstacles.
	
Unlike other cohabitants of the Antarctic Circle, emperor penguins mate in the winter months of April and May.  Males grow yellow tufts in the areas surrounding their ears, suspected of being an attraction factor for females.  Unlike other species’ males that compete for nesting space and attract the females through quaint rituals (e.g. Adele penguin males throw scarcely available rocks at the feet of females to “get their attention”), emperor penguins do not create nest and put on mating displays that last for weeks, during which the future parents learn each other’s call.  After copulation and, about 15 days later, the laying of a single, soft-ball sized egg, the female leaves to the sea where she embarks on a mission to feed well.  Meanwhile, the father cares for the egg.  To protect it from the frosty floor, for the next 6-8 weeks the father balances the egg on its two feet, under the protective blubbery flaps of its underbelly, to keep it warm.  During the whole incubation period the father does not eat and may lose a third to half of its body weight.  

The mother returns right before hatching (usually at the beginning of September), well-fed and with food for her offspring.  The two parents apparently find themselves through distinguishable calls.  Visual aids are useless in a crowd of 6000 penguins that all look similar.  The mother then feeds the chicks for the first time, regurgitating some of the spoils caught while she was away.  As the female broods the young, the father is free to replenish his energy, only to return to jointly rear the chick along with the mother.	

The newly hatched chicks are barely protected from the sub-zero temperatures by their downy coats.  Another important behavior, displayed similarly between adult penguins and chicks, is the formation of clustered groups called crèches. Within these groups the birds are able to maintain temperatures of about 96 degrees F, in contrast to the minus 30 degrees winds.  So much heat is created in these crèches that the group must constantly move from location to avoid falling into the melted holes in the ice created by the heat generated by these crowds.  This story ends when penguin chicks, huddled in groups at the edge of the sea, hop onto a recently broken-off chunk of ice and float towards the north to go on with their lives. 

“How” do these behaviors occur?  What are the proximate reasons of these behaviors? These breeding and brooding behaviors are influenced by many factors.  Studies have shown that anatomical preparation for copulation is not stimulated by the mating displays, as is seen in other species.  Penguins that reach the mating areas have seven times the normal amount of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (in males) and estrogen (in females) upon arrival, suggesting that geographical or environmental cues activate gonodal preparation, specifically corresponding to maximum size of the gonads (1).  Between copulation and egg-laying, levels of all hormones begin to fall, but LT remains slightly above average in incubating males, and in both males and females that are rearing their young.  This leads to the conclusion that LT is responsible for incubating, brooding and territorial behavior.  The hormone prolactin has also been linked to parental care (2). 

Next question should be why these behaviors happen?  What are the ultimate causes?  Why do penguins endure the harsh Antarctic winter and choose to have their young during this apparently dangerous time?  Speculation has lead to a few hypotheses.  One is the lack of predators.  These penguins are the only animals left during the winter’s cold.  There are no leopard seals to menace the young.  Another advantage of wintering the summer grounds is the first access to the abundance of food that the early warmer season brings.  The quantity of food and the climate is perfect for the chicks to learn to fend for themselves.  These two factors may have been enough evolutionary pressure to give rise to these vital behavioral traits in emperor penguins.

If they &quot;founded&quot; Western civilization, then I suppose there was no civilization here when &quot;they&quot; got here. Is that correct? Perhaps the text should be revised. Perhaps not. - Lloyd -

[[Image:Quince.jpg|thumb|right|A quince]]

A '''Quince''' is a pear-shaped golden-yellow [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] that is very loosely related to the [[Cookbook:Pear |pear]] and the [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]]. It was a common element in medieval cooking, but is rarely used now. Its flavor is similar to that of the pear and apple, but much stronger and more sour. Because of its firm texture and sourness (even when ripe), it's not often eaten raw.

Quinces can be made into [[Cookbook:Jam|jams]], [[Cookbook:Jelly|jellies]], and [[Cookbook:Pudding|puddings]]. Since quince is very aromatic, it can be added to apple jams to increase their flavor. It can also be skinned and [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] or [[Cookbook:Poaching|poached]] in [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] and made into a [[Cookbook:Cobbler|cobbler]] or [[Cookbook:Tart|tart]].

'''Rice Pilaf'''.  Pilaf can be served as a side-dish or main dish.

==Ingredients==
*6 Tablespoons butter or margarine
*2 cups uncooked long grain rice
*4 cups boiling hot chicken broth
*1/4 teaspoon salt
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 4 cloves
* 1 big onion, finely cut
* 2 carrots in fine cubes

==Procedure==
# Melt butter or margarine in heavy deep pan or Dutch oven over medium heat.
# Add vegetables and let them be lightly cooked without coloring, using the vegies would mean you omit the orzo pasta
# Add rice and stir until rice is well coated with butter. Allow rice to simmer in butter for a minute or two.
# Add boiling chicken broth and salt. 
# Lower heat to a simmer, cover pan and cook 25-minutes over low heat until liquid is absorbed.
# Gently fluff with a fork. Let stand for 15 to 20 minutes before serving. 

Makes 8 servings.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Substitute an equal amount of vegetable broth for the chicken broth to create a vegetarian version of this recipe.
* Substitute orzo with pine nuts if desired; this is traditionally done in Lebanon.

'''OSA''' stands for ''oversampling'', also known as ''anti-aliasing''. If you look at the rendering below, you'll find that the one has a rugged edge. It looks like small steps! To stop this, Blender uses OSA to prevent &quot;jagged edges&quot; or &quot;aliasing&quot; as it's called.[[Image:Render_settings_OSA_row.png|thumb|right|Oversampling settings in render tab.]] 


This occurs when you have a diagonal change of colour, which results in rough edges. Remember drawing a diagonal line in Paint? To overcome this hindrance of square pixels, a technique called anti-aliasing or &quot;oversampling&quot; is used. It blends the colours around the rough edge to create a smooth, but defined edge. One way of doing this is to by creating the image twice as large, then scaling it down - oversampling. Blender can do this for you if you select an OSA rate. Remember this will take much longer, but results in better renders, so use this for the final product, not while testing. In some cases the scene can seem blurred due to oversampled textures; try changing the OSA setting, or oversampling yourself.

Here's a quick illustration of how OSA changes a render (look at the edges):

[[Image:OSA_comparison.png|thumb|650px|center|The image on the left has no OSA. The one on the right has 16x (the maximum amount allowed by Blender).]]

OSA settings can be manipulated in from the Render Settings panel.

'''Thousand Island''' is a salad dressing commonly used with green salads.  It can also be used as a  sandwich spread, or many other uses.  

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup (235 ml) [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
* 1/4 cup (60 ml) [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
* 2 tablespoons (30 ml) white vinegar
* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) granulated sugar
* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) sweet pickle relish
* 2 teaspoons (10 ml) finely minced onions
* 1/4 teaspoon (1 ml) salt
* dash of pepper

Makes 1 1/2 cups of dressing.

==Procedure==
# Combine all ingredients in a [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]], and process till smooth.  The goal is to have a pink smooth sauce.
# Pour the sauce into a bowl and chill covered in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes prior to use.

==Notes, tips and variations==
# Instead of using the blender, whisk the ingredients in a bowl.

==Warnings==
* Keep refrigerated

== Section Overview ==

* Operating the Linux filesystem
* Maintaining a Linux filesystem
* Creating and configuring filesystem options

== Operating the Linux filesystem ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to properly configure and navigate the standard Linux filesystem. This objective includes configuring and mounting various filesystem types. Also included, is manipulating filesystems to adjust for disk space requirements or device additions.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:
 /etc/fstab
 /etc/mtab
 /proc/mounts
 mount and umount
 sync
 swapon
 swapoff

=== Mounting and unmounting partition ===

To access an existing partition you need to mount it first using the ''mount'' command. &lt;br&gt;
For example if you want to mount a ntfs partition on /mnt/windows you should issue the following command:
 mount -t ntfs /dev/hda3 /mnt/windows
Of course you need to change hda3 with your ntfs partition. &lt;br&gt;
To umount a partition you simply need to use ''umount''
 umount /mnt/windows
or
 umount /dev/hda3
If you use mount without arguments it will print the currently mounted devices, you can also see /proc/mounts and /etc/mtab to discover which partition are currently mounted.&lt;br&gt;

=== Fstab ===

If you want to use a more automatic method to mount filesystem you should edit /etc/fstab

 &lt;file system&gt; &lt;mount point&gt;   &lt;type&gt;  &lt;options&gt;       &lt;dump&gt;  &lt;pass&gt;
 proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
 /dev/hda2       /               ext3    defaults        0       1
 /dev/hda4       none            swap    defaults        0       0
 /dev/hda1       /boot           ext3    defaults        0       2
 /dev/hda3       /mnt/windows    ntfs    defaults        0       0
 /dev/hdb        /media/cdrom    iso9660 ro,user,noauto  0       0
 /dev/fd0        /media/floppy   auto    user,noauto     0       0

In the above example of /etc/fstab we have the ntfs partition mounted automatically during the system boot on /mnt/windows, while on the cdrom and floppy devices we have specified the noauto and user options, this means that they aren't mounted during boot but also that any user can mount it whenever they need. The sixth field should be 1 for root filesystem and 2 for other fs that need to be checked with fsck during boot.

=== Swap ===

The swap partition can be used as virtual memory, to create a swap partition you should use ''mkswap''

 mkswap /dev/hda4

and need to be activated with ''swapon''

 swapon /dev/hda4

you can also deactivate it with ''swapoff''

 swapoff /dev/hda4

=== Sync ===
The ''sync'' utility can be used to force the change onto the partition, modern filesystem like ext3 or reiserfs sync the partition every time that a change is made so you don't need to issue the command manually.

=== Exercises ===.

== Maintaining a Linux filesystem ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to properly maintain a Linux filesystem using system utilities. This objective includes manipulating a standard ext2 filesystem.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:
 fsck (fsck.ext2)
 badblocks
 mke2fs
 dumpe2fs
 debuge2fs
 tune2fs

=== Formatting a partition ===

Before you format a partition you need to choose the right filesystem for your needs. The most common filesystem on linux is ext3 which is a journaled filesystem based on ext2. To format a partition with a filesystem you need to use the ''mkfs.*'' commands

  #ext3
  mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda1
  #fat
  mkfs.vfat /dev/hda1
  #xfs 
  mkfs.xfs /dev/hda1
  #reiserfs
  mkfs.reiserfs /dev/hda1

to create an ext2/ext3 filesystem you can also use the mke2fs utility

 #ext2
 mke2fs /dev/hda1
 #ext3
 mke2fs -j /dev/hda1

=== Configuring and repair filesystem ===

''tune2fs'' it's an utility used to tune ext2/ext3 filesystem

 #add the journal to an ext2 filesystem(convert from ext2 to ext3)
 tune2fs -j /dev/hda1
 #set the max mount count before the filesystem is checked for errors to 30
 tune2fs -c 30 /dev/hda1 
 #set the max time before the filesystem is checked for errors to 10 days
 tune2fs -i 10d /dev/hda1

you can also tune a reiserfs partition using ''reiserfstune''

 #create a new journal for /dev/hda1 into /dev/hda2 
 reiserfstune --journal-new-device /dev/hda2 -f /dev/hda1

to check a filesystem for errors you can use ''fsck.*''

  #ext3
  fsck.ext3 /dev/hda1
  #fat
  fsck.vfat /dev/hda1
  #xfs 
  fsck.xfs /dev/hda1
  #reiserfs
  fsck.reiserfs /dev/hda1

you can also just run fsck /dev/hda1 directly and it will detect the filesystem
 

=== Exercises ===.

== Creating and configuring filesystem options ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to configure automount filesystems. This objective includes configuring automount for network and device filesystems. Also included is creating non ext2 filesystems for devices such as CD-ROMs.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:
 /etc/auto.master
 /etc/auto.[dir]
 mkisofs
 dd
 mke2fs

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The purpose of this experiment is to discover the effect of temperature upon the rising of bread dough. The process of dough rising is based on yeast. Yeast is a type of fungus which breaks sugar down into smaller components. The type of yeast used for these tests is ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', which was domesticated for wine, beer and bread production thousands of years ago. ''S. cerevisiae'' is commonly referred to as baker’s yeast or brewer’s yeast for this reason.

Yeasts used for leavening bread can be either caught from the environment or produced commercially. In the environment, yeast can easily be found in fruits and berries (such as apples, peaches, and grapes), as well as in plant exudates (such as sap).

When mixed with bread dough, the yeast converts sugar molecules into carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), alcohol and water. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; expands in the dough to produce gaseous bubbles. These bubbles cause the bread to rise - the more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; present, the faster the bread will rise. If temperature is related to the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced by yeast, then higher temperatures will result in increased production of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Procedure==

Materials:
*1 [[w:Erlenmeyer Flask|Erlenmeyer Flask]]
*1 One-hole Rubber Stopper
*1 hir
*1 Striker
*1 600 ml Glass Beaker
*1 Glass Beaker of any size (large enough to contain flask)
*1 Thermometer
*Yeast Solution
*Petroleum Jelly
*ice andor snow
*Glass Tubing
*Hot Plate
*Table for the recording of data (Figure 2)
*Access to tap water and natural gas will also be necessary.


1. Using the bunsen burner, bend the glass tubing so that it will reach from the inside of the Erlenmeyer flask to the bottom of the glass beaker, leaving enough room for gas to escape while in the beaker. (See Figure 1)

2. Add 75 ml of yeast solution to the flask.

3. Add 500 ml of water to the beaker.

4. Place the rubber stopper in the flask and apply petroleum jelly around the hole of the stopper to stop gas from escaping.  Insert the glass tubing so that it will receive gas from the flask and carry it underneath the water in the beaker, and place the beaker and flask on a lab counter. (See Figure 3)

5. Observe the beaker for ten minutes and count the number of bubbles escaping into the water. Record this information and the current room temperature in a data table. (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig2.png|Figure 2]])

6. Find the average number of bubbles per minute and record this in the data table.

7. Remove the glass tubing from the apparatus.

8. Repeat steps 2-7 at a temperature of 83 degrees Celsius, placing the flask in a hot water bath prepared using the hot plate and waiting for five minutes to allow the yeast to reach the appropriate temperature before inserting the glass tubing. (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig4.png|Fig. 4]])

9. Repeat steps 2-7 at a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, placing the flask in a container full of snow or a cold water bath and waiting for five minutes to allow the yeast to reach the appropriate temperature before inserting the glass tubing. (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig5.png|Fig. 5]])

10. Disconnect the materials, clean them and replace them in their proper locations.

==Conclusions==

The data collected (as seen in [[:Image:YeastLabFig10.png|Figure 10]]) shows an average of 0 carbon dioxide bubbles per minute at 0 degrees Celsius, an average of 11.5 bubbles per minute at 19 degrees Celsius, and an average of 76.8 bubbles per minute at 83 degrees Celsius. 

The test at 83 deg. C showed a near-constant decline in the amount of bubbles as time passed. This occurred because the sugar fueling the yeast is depleted, so the yeast has less fuel to produce carbon dioxide.  (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig6.png|Fig. 6]]).  The test at 0 degrees Celsius showed no production of carbon dioxide, presumably because the low temperatures killed the yeast.  (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig7.png|Fig. 7]]).  The room temperature test (19 deg. C) showed a fairly even level of carbon dioxide production, but not enough to be useful in the making of leavened bread.  (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig8.png|Fig. 8]])

We incurred two experimental errors in the first testing at 0 degrees Celsius. By beginning the testing immediately following the insertion of the yeast solution into the cold water bath, the warm air molecules in the flask were not given an opportunity to cool before being attached to the rest of the apparatus. This caused a vacuum to form in the glass tubing, pulling water up the tubing rather than pushing the gas out. Attempting to remedy the situation, we moved the flask into a slightly warmer area, skewing the results by raising the temperature enough to allow carbon dioxide production. Applying this knowledge to the second test eliminated these anomalies.

This experiment shows that carbon dioxide production from yeast increases with increased temperature, as the number of carbon dioxide bubbles increased as the temperature rose.  (See [[:Image:YeastLabFig9.png|Fig. 9]]).  However, yeast consumes sugar much faster at higher temperatures, causing dramatic growth for a short amount of time which quickly drops to very low levels.  Because the rising of bread dough is dependent on the amount of carbon dioxide produced, increased temperatures will result in bread rising farther than it would at room temperatures. It can also be concluded that bread will not rise at freezing temperatures, as the carbon dioxide necessary to make the bread do so is not present.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
	The purpose of this [[w:experiment|experiment]] is to discover the effect of temperature upon the rising of [[w:bread dough|bread dough]].  The process of dough rising is based on [[w:yeast|yeast]].  Yeast is a type of [[w:fungus|fungus]] which breaks sugar down into smaller components.  The type of yeast we will be using is [[w:Saccharomyces cerevisiae|Saccharomyces cerevisiae]], which was domesticated for wine, beer and bread production thousands of years ago.  S. cerevisiae is commonly referred to as baker’s yeast or brewer’s yeast for this reason.
	Yeasts used for leavening bread can be either caught from the environment or produced commercially.  
	When mixed with bread dough, the yeast converts sugar molecules into carbon dioxide (CO2), alcohol and water.  The CO2 expands in the dough to produce gaseous bubbles.  These bubbles cause the bread to rise - the more CO2 present, the faster the bread will rise.  If temperature is related to the amount of CO2 produced by yeast, then higher temperatures will result in increased production of CO2.

==Procedure==

Materials:
*1 Erlenmeyer Flask
*1 One-hole Rubber Stopper
*1 Bunsen Burner
*1 Striker
*1 Glass Beaker (any size)
*1 Jar large enough to hold flask
*1 Thermometer
*Yeast Solution
*Ice
*Hot Plates
*Glass Tubing
*Access to tap water and natural gas will also be necessary..

1. Using the bunsen burner, bend the glass tubing so that it will reach from the inside of the  Erlenymeyer flask to the bottom of the glass beaker, leaving enough room for gas to escape while in the beaker.  (See Figure 1)

2. Add  75 ml of yeast solution to the flask.

3. Add 500 ml of water to the beaker.

4. Place the rubber stopper in the flask and insert the glass tubing so that it will receive gas from the flask and carry it underneath the water in the beaker.  Place the beaker and flask on a lab counter. (See Fig. 1)

5. Observe the beaker for ten minutes and count the number of bubbles escaping into the water.  Record this information and the current room temperature in a data table. (See Fig. 2)

6. Find the average number of bubbles per minute and record this in the data table.

7. Remove the glass tubing from the apparatus.

8. Repeat steps 2-7 at a temperature of ___ degrees Celsius, placing the flask in a hot water bath and ensuring that the yeast solution has reached the appropriate temperature before inserting the glass tubing.   (See fig. 3)

9. Repeat steps 2-7 at a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, placing the flask in a cold water bath and ensuring that the yeast solution has reached the appropriate temperature before inserting the glass tubing.  (See fig. 4)

10. Disconnect the materials, clean them and replace them in their proper locations.</text>

----

The present perfect (''el perfecto de indicativo'') is used to communicate events in the past for which there is a relationship to the present.  For example:

:''I have written'' three letters today.
::''He escrito'' tres cartas hoy.

It is formed by using the conjugated present indicative form of [[../Haber|Haber]] with the [[../Past Participle|past participle]] of the action. In the above example, ''He'' is the first person form of '''Haber''' and ''escrito'' is the past participle of '''Escribir'''.

Here are examples in different persons:
::Tú has comido el bocadillo. ''You have eaten the sandwich.''
::Él ha dicho la verdad. ''He has told the truth.''
::Nosotros hemos visto el cuadro. ''We have seen the picture.''
::Vosotros habéis hablado con el presidente. ''You (plural, familiar) have spoken with the president.''
::Uds. han vivido en California. ''You (plural, formal) have lived in California.''

I think this book contains some really useful information, but in its current form it's not all that much fun for a reader to read through this.
There are multiple issues that could be improved and make this book into a really good one (and make it fun to read an contribute to):

'''Table of Contents:''' 
One of the first things a possible reader is going to see when encountering this book is the main page with the table of contents. In my eyes however the table of contents is quite big and contains some things that could easily be moved to other pages (for example do we really need a link to every control structure in the table of contents? Alternatively there could be a table of contents of the main topics which is easy to navigate and a list of all default modules, classes, and commands) to improve readibility.

'''Consistent syntax highlighting:''' Currently I see multiple ways how code is highlighted. (There's basically inlines [[Ruby_Programming/Data_types#Symbols|without borders]] and [[Ruby_Programming/Data_types#Hashes|some with borders]]; code is typically highlighted but with console outputs it's not always clear.) Content wise this isn't a real issue but I think it would do good to the presentation quality of this book. I'm not sure if there's a general style guideline for it already and I'm missing anything out, but what about making sure that everything is in a bordered box so it's clear where the main text stops and the code example starts? 

'''Page completion:''' I think it would mean a lot if it was easy to spot from the table of contents how finished a given page is. Some pages really could need more work than others do.

'''Outdated information:''' Some pages deal with stuff that's not absolutely up to date with newest Ruby versions anymore (eg. old default encoding ascii). Should this be fixed or left as is? Personally I'd like the idea of having a really up to date book that will enable people to use current versions of Ruby.

Ok these are just some things and I didn't finger point at everything but I think it's a good idea to see what could all be done about the book. I'll try to fix some of these things, but I just wanted to know what anyone else thinks about this all and I don't want to accidentally do something that needs to be reverted...

[[User:Evotopid|Evotopid]] ([[User talk:Evotopid|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Evotopid|contribs]]) 18:04, 28 March 2015 (UTC)

:I completely agree. ''Old info needs to be removed,'' no question. Plus, I don't see the benefit of having all the library reference material in this textbook when the [http://ruby-doc.org/ official Ruby docs] contain it all, and are freely-licensed. I think we should delete those sections, and I'll be tidying up a bit. --[[User:Tmewett5|Tmewett5]] ([[User talk:Tmewett5|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Tmewett5|contribs]]) 16:03, 2 October 2015 (UTC)

== Organization ==

The organization of the new material on strings is a mess.  Why the heck is it placed before the section on Basic Ruby?  Why are the sections on &quot;Alternate Quotes&quot;, &quot;Here Documents&quot;, and &quot;ASCII&quot; separate chapters rather than being subsections of the &quot;Strings&quot; chapter?

--[[User:OinkOink|OinkOink]] 23:32, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

:Exactly. I warned the user doing all this that some of his/her creations were a bad idea, but nothing stopped. It would be nice if some others came in and started correcting it all. I did once and was reverted, so this user may not take it easily. If such an edit war continues, bring it to my or another admin's attention and we will try to resolve it. This book is heading in a bad direction. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:41, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

I wonder if it isn't time to put in some additional structure to the &quot;Getting Started&quot; section.  There are really three or four big headings here:  

* &quot;Getting Started&quot; includes installing, writing scripts as files, running scripts
* &quot;Baby Steps&quot; (insert better name here) includes the &quot;hello world&quot; example and a whirlwind 2-3 chapter tour of what Ruby is about including some OO
* &quot;More Depth&quot; (again, insert better name here) is a more methodical one-chapter-per-topic coverage, enough for your average programming task.

Then the intermediate section is an alacarte of self-contained topics, and the language reference for more details.  Yes, I know this structure follows Pickaxe pretty closely.

-- [[User:Marburg|Marburg]] 23:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

== Examples ==
Would those who are working on this project mind putting exercises at the end of sections so that people like myself who are learning the language could practice implementing some programs? Thank you very much for your time, and the tutorial has taught me a lot already.

Sincerely,
Eric Scrivner 

== Tutorial ==
I once started a tutorial on Ruby.  It's right here:

http://www.math.umd.edu/~dcarrera/ruby/0.3/index.html

If any of this content is useful for this Ruby Wikibook feel free to take it.  I have alread released the tutorial as GNU FDL, so it should be compatible with this Wikibook.  But I'm happy to make it public domain if necessary.

I wish I had time to work on this project, but I'm already leading a large documentation project (oooauthors.org).

Cheers,
Daniel Carrera.

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

You might want to consider the [[WB:NP]]. You current naming convention is depreciated and has several disadvantages - like it has no navigational links. Also you worthy effort is neiter considered a book nor a section inside a book. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm wikistats] which implements an exstensive book and section detector.

::All the moves and re-organization is now done. Inter-linking within the book still needs significant work. Some double redirects might still exist and there aren't any navigation headers within pages two levels down or lower. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:04, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

== Ruby Prog? ==

Supriya, the name &quot;Ruby Prog&quot; is inconsistent with other programming books on Wikibooks. For example:

* [[Ada Programming]]
* [[C Programming]]
* [[C++ Programming]]
* [[C Sharp Programming]]
* [[Java Programming]]

I don't see the reason for the name change. Also, many of the links to the sections broke when you renamed the main page. I'm going to revert.

[[Image:Garlic Press and Garlic.jpg|thumb|right|Garlic being crushed using a garlic press.]]

A '''garlic press''' is a small kitchen tool designed to simplify the process of crushing a clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]. It is a hinged device. The garlic clove is put into a containing section and when the arms of the press are closed, the clove is crushed and the pulp is forced out through a grating. 

It may be useful if you have to crush a lot of cloves in a short time, but for one or two cloves, better results are obtained by crushing them between the blade of a knife and a chopping board.

A food processor may also be used to prepare garlic cloves.</text>

==MySQL==
[[Programming:MySQL|MySQL]] is the most popular database used with PHP. PHP with MySQL is a powerful combination showing the real power of Server-Side scripting. PHP has a wide range of MySQL functions available with the help of a separate module. In PHP5, this module has been removed and must be downloaded separately.

MySQL allows users to create tables, where data can be stored much more efficiently than the way data is stored in arrays.

In order to use MySQL or databases in general effectively, you need to understand [[SQL|SQL]], or Structured Query Language.

Note that this page uses the mysqli functions and not the old mysql functions.

==How to - Step By Step==
===Connecting to the MySQL server===
PHP has the function '''mysqli_connect''' to connect to a MySQL server that handles all of the low level socket handling. We will supply 4 arguments; the first is the name of your MySQL server, the second a MySQL username, third a MySQL password and last a database name. In this example, it is assumed your server is localhost. If you are running a web server on one system, and MySQL on another system, you can replace localhost with the IP address or domain name of the system that MySQL resides on (ensure all firewalls are configured to open the appropriate ports). '''mysqli_connect''' returns a link_identifier that we can now use for communicating with the database. We will store this link in a variable called ''$cxn''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $cxn = mysqli_connect (&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;your_user_name&quot;, &quot;your_password&quot;, &quot;database_name&quot;);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Running a Query===
We have connected to the mysql server and then selected the database we want to use, now we can run an SQL query over the database to select information, do an insert, update or delete. To do this we use '''mysqli_query'''. This takes two arguments: the first is our link_identifier and the second is an SQL query string. If we are doing a select sql statement '''mysqli_query''' generates a resource or the Boolean false to say our query failed, and if we are doing a delete, insert or update it generates a Boolean, true or false, to say if that was successful or not.

The basic code for running a query is the php function &quot;mysqli_query($cxn, $query)&quot;. The &quot;$query&quot; argument is a MySQL query. The database argument is a database connection(here, the connection represented by $cxn). For example, to return the query &quot;SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_id ASC&quot;, you could write

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
    mysqli_query($cxn, &quot;SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_id ASC&quot;);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

However, this straightforward method will quickly become ungainly due to the length of MySQL queries and the common need to repeat the query when handling the return. All (or almost all) queries are therefore made in two steps. First, the query is assigned a variable (conventionally, this variable is named &quot;$query&quot; or &quot;$sql_query&quot; for purposes of uniformity and easy recognition), which allows the program to call simply &quot;mysqli_query($cxn, $sql_query)&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$sql_query = &quot;SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_id ASC&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Secondly, to handle the information returned from the query, practical considerations require that the information returned also be assigned to a variable. Again by convention rather than necessity (i.e. you could name it anything you wanted), this information is often assigned to &quot;$result&quot;, and the function is called by the assignment of the variable.

It is important to understand that this code '''calls the function mysqli_query''', in addition to assigning the return to a variable &quot;$result&quot;.  ['''NOTE''': The queries that ask for information -- SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, and EXPLAIN -- return what is called a [[resource]]. Other types of queries, which manipulate the database, return TRUE if the operation is successful and FALSE if not, or if the user does not have permission to access the table referenced.]

To catch an error, for debugging purposes, we can write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
   $result = mysqli_query ($cxn, $sql_query)
     or die (mysqli_error () . &quot; The query was:&quot; . $sql_query);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
'''NOTE:''' The semi colon for the function before the die statment is omitted.

If the function '''mysqli_query''' returns false, PHP will terminate the script and print an error report from MySQL (such as &quot;you have an error in your SQL syntax&quot;) and the query.

Thus, our final code would be, assuming that there were a database connection named $cxn:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php 
$sql_query = &quot;SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY customer_id ASC&quot;;
$result = mysqli_query ($cxn, $sql_query)
    or die (mysqli_error () . &quot; The query was:&quot; . $sql_query);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Putting it all together===
In the previous sections we looked at three commands, but not at how to use them in conjunction with each other. So let's take a look at selecting information for a table in our mysql database called ''MyTable'', which is stored in a mysql database called ''MyDB''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
	 //Connect to the mysql server and get back our link_identifier
	 $link = mysql_connect (&quot;your_database_host&quot;, &quot;your_user_name&quot;, &quot;your_password&quot;)
                   or die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
 
	 //Now, we select which database we would like to use
	 mysql_select_db (&quot;MyDB&quot;, $link) or die('could not select database'); 
 
 //Our SQL Query
 $sql_query = &quot;Select * From MyTable&quot;;
 
 //Run our sql query
 $result = mysql_query($sql_query)or die('query failed'. mysql_error());

 
	 //Close Database Connection
	 mysql_close ($link);
 ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
'''NOTE:''' If the link identifier is not specified, the last link opened by [http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-connect.php mysql_connect()] is assumed.

===The Create Database Query ===
[By admin@technofranchise.com : We have used my_sqli connector that is the latest construct. There are some other tutorials that use my_sql construct to make the database connections (Don't confuse with it. Our constructor is the latest one)
The creation of the database is our first step when accessing the backend MySql Server with php script. This can be achieved by connecting with the server. After that, creating the database. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$cn=mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;your_username&quot;,&quot;my_password&quot;); 

//connecting the server
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo &quot;Error in establisihng the connection:&quot; . mysqli_connect_error();
}
$sql_query=&quot;CREATE DATABASE  MyDB&quot;;
if (mysqli_query($cn,$sql_query))
{
echo &quot;Database has been created&quot;;
}
else
{
echo &quot;Error while creating the database: ” . mysqli_error($cn);
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Create Table Query===
The process of creating the table is as easy as creating the database. We have to execute the create table query using the mysqli construct

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$cn=mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;my_username&quot;,&quot;my_password&quot;,&quot;MyDatabase&quot;);

if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo &quot;Connection failed : &quot; . mysqli_connect_error();
}
$sql_query=&quot;CREATE TABLE  MyTable(firstName VARCHAR(18), lastName VARCHAR(18), salary DECIMAL(5,4) )&quot;;
if (mysqli_query($cn,$sql_query))
{
echo &quot;Table created successfully&quot;;
}
else
{
echo &quot;Error encountered  while creating the table : &quot; . mysqli_error($cn);
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Getting Select Query Information with older connector construct===
Well that doesn’t help, because what are we to do with ''$result''? Well when we do a select query we select out information from a database we get back what is known as a resource, and that is what is stored in ''$result'', our resource identifier. A resource is a special type of PHP variable, but lets look at how to access information in this resource.

We can use a function called '''mysql_fetch_assoc''' it takes one parameter, our resource identifier ''$result'', and generates an associative array corresponding to the fetched row. Each column in the table corresponds to an index with the same name. We can now extract out information and print it like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php 
 //Connect to the mysql server and get back our link_identifier
 $link = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;your_user_name&quot;, &quot;your_password&quot;)
         or die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());


 //Now, we select which database we would like to use
 mysql_select_db(&quot;MyDB&quot;) or die('could not select database'); 

 //Our SQL Query
 $sql_query = &quot;Select * From MyTable&quot;;

 //Run our sql query
 $result = mysql_query($sql_query)or die('query failed'. mysql_error());

 //iterate through result
 while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result))
 {
     //Prints out information of that row
     print_r($row);
     echo $row['foo'];
     //Prints only the column foo.
 }
 
 // Free resultset (optional)
 mysql_free_result($result);


 //Close the MySQL Link
 mysql_close($link);
 ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;


===Inserting the records with latest connector construct===

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$cn=mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;your_username&quot;,&quot;your_password&quot;,&quot;MyDB&quot;);
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo &quot;Connection failed : &quot; . 
mysqli_connect_error();
}
mysqli_query($cn,&quot;INSERT INTO MyTable(firstName, lastName, salary) VALUES ('George','Smith' ,55000)&quot;);

mysqli_close($cn);

?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Updating the records with latest connector construct===
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$cn=mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;your_username&quot;,&quot;your_password&quot;,&quot;MyDB&quot;);
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo &quot;Connection failed : &quot; . mysqli_connect_error();
}
mysqli_query($cn,”Update MyTable Set salary=6000 Where firstName='George' AND lastName='Smith' &quot;);
mysqli_close($cn);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Delete the records===
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
$cn=mysqli_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;,&quot;your_username&quot;,&quot;your_password&quot;,&quot;MyDB&quot;);
if (mysqli_connect_errno())
{
echo &quot;Connection failed : &quot; . mysqli_connect_error();
}
mysqli_query($cn,&quot;Delete From MyTable Where firstName='George' AND lastName='Smith' “);
mysqli_close($cn);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== '''PHP + MySQL + Sphinx''' ==
Once you understand the basics of how MySQL functions with PHP you might want to start learning about full text search engines. Once your site gets large (millions of database records) MySQL queries will start to get painfully slow, especially if you use them to search for text with wildcards:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;WHERE content='%text%')&lt;/source&gt;

There are many free/paid solutions to stop this problem. A good open source full text search engine is [[Sphinx Search]]. There is a WikiBook on how to use it with PHP and MySQL that explains the concepts of how Indexing works. You might want to read it before reading the official documentation.

''From First Principles to Classical Mechanics to General Relativity''

&lt;!--Below is a tentative layout that is based on the treatment of the object-independent mathematical path followed by the treatment of the object itself.  Topics will be rearranged, fleshed-out, etc. as the sections progress.

The convention for sections are &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Theoretical Physics (Introduction)/section/subsection/sub-subsection/etc.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.--&gt;


Theoretical physics is the branch of physics that deals with developing and evolving theory to explain the fundamental nature of the universe.  It is possibly the most important branch of physics in that without it physics would stagnate and no new discoveries or ideas would develop.

Theoretical physics is the earliest form of science and our earliest written records show that it began over 2,500 years ago in ancient Greece.  The scholars of ancient Greece were the first we know of to attempt a thoroughgoing investigation of the universe.  They did this through a systematic gathering of knowledge through the activity of human reason alone which we call today ''philosophy''.  And for many centuries afterward, the term philosophy was used as the equivalent of the word science which is a recent invention.  

Greek natural philosophy was the first attempt to explain the universe without resorting to the supernatural.  The Greek word for &quot;natural&quot; is ''physikos'', which is where we get our modern word for the science of physics.

One of the first phenomena that the Greeks contemplated was ''motion''.  The Greek ideas on ''motion'' were put into sophisticated form by the philosopher Aristotle (384-322 B.C.).  In Aristotle's theory, objects or ''elements'' had a natural place.  He basically theorized that objects on earth made of earth, water, fire or air tended to return to their natural place.  So on earth, matter had a tendency to remain at rest and when matter was put in motion, it came to rest.  In the heavens, Aristotle's theory said that heavenly bodies were a fifth element where earthly laws did not apply.  In the heavens, therefore, the laws included a theory of perpetual motion.

From this small beginning, theoretical physics had its foundation upon which the greats in physics from Kepler and Galileo to Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein and other modern physicists would begin to build physics as we know it today.

Any treatment of theoretical physics describes not only the history of the development of physics, but also the fundamental ideas and notions of the natural world that inspired physicists to create new models of it.  Often new theories were based upon new facts coming to light, new methods of measurement and new observations made possible by the development of technology.  However just as often new theory was and is based upon existing theory and is many times simply a clarification or adjustment to existing theories making them a more accurate model of reality.  It is for this reason that Isaac Newton said: &quot;If I have seen farther than others, it has been by standing on the shoulders of giants.&quot;  Therefore, included in this discussion of theoretical physics are the prior theories that physicists built upon that led up to the mainstream theories that physics upholds today.

==Theory==
To understand theoretical physics, one must understand the concept of ''theory''.  Theories are simple models of complex systems.  The universe is a complex system.  In order to analyze the universe as the science of physics does, it must be broken down into simple principles and basic ideas that create a visualization or model.  A theory must be useful in that it should approximate reality and make it understandable, measurable, and predictable.

Aristotle realized, there must be propositions that do not need, for whatever reason, to be proven. Such propositions he called the first principles (archai, principia) of demonstration. 

To create a theory, one must begin with assumptions or postulates.  An assumption is something accepted without proof.  The assumptions are therefore the weak point of any theory.  Due to this fact, William of Ockham circa 1300 A.D., a medieval English philosopher, emphasized that the fewer the assumptions, the more useful the theory.  

The assumptions should then lead to a theory that contains explanations of reality and the observations of reality should be able to be explained and even predicted by the theory.  Therefore the predictions of the theory can be tested.

A theory can however be disproved if it can be shown that two contradictory conclusions can be drawn from it.  The scientific method used in modern times to test the viability of a theory is to draw a necessary conclusion from the theory and then check it against actual phenomena as rigorously as possible.  This is called experimentation.

When assumptions become universally accepted as an established rule, they are called axioms and sometimes universal laws.

==Mathematical Foundations==
The most ancient written records from every culture show forms of measurement and basic arithmetic.  Mathematics first arose out of the need to do calculations in commerce, to understand the relationships between numbers, to measure land, and to predict astronomical events. The history of mathematics ranges from Babylonian mathematics with its sexagesimal (base 60) system dating back 4,000 years, to Euclidean Geometry which dates to 300 B.C. and to modern calculus created by Isaac Newton and Leibniz in 1666. 

The development of physics has always been intertwined with mathematics and measurements.  Mathematics and measurement are the basic testing ground for determining the usefulness of a theory.

Mathematics can be broadly subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry and analysis).  Each of these broad fields of mathematics has branched out into more abstract and complex forms due to the nature of the complex systems they must explain.  Mathematical shorthand has been invented to create simple notations to denote not only simple values, but entire formulas, systems, or algorithms.  

The test of theory in theoretical physics relies strongly upon mathematics.  The necessary prerequisite mathematics include algebra, geometry, algebra 2, trigonometry, calculus (single variable and multivariable), analytic geometry, linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, complex numbers, the complex plane and probability theory.  Today much of theoretical physics relies on vector calculus.  However, the mathematics itself is meaningless without the measurements that it represents, therefore, the international system of units must be understood as well which involve such measurements as the kilogram, second, metre, ampere, Kelvin, and mole.

In theoretical physics, if the mathematics of a theory is found to be inaccurate, the theory collapses.  Therefore, the importance of mathematical rigor in theoretical physics cannot be overstated.

===[[Introduction to Theoretical Physics/Mathematical Foundations/Arithmetic, Physics, and Mathematics|Arithmetic, Physics and Mathematics, or the Units of Measurement]]===

==Classical Mechanics==
:Where space is flat, h is zero, and c is infinite.

===Light===
The Greeks also had theories on light, its properties and its speed.  They thought light did not have movement or speed, because if it did, the speed would be too great to contemplate. They concluded that light must simply either be there or not be there.  Aristotle, the famous Greek natural philosopher, said that &quot;...light is neither fire nor any kind whatsoever of body nor an efflux from any kind of body ... It is certainly not a body, ... clearly therefore, light is just the presence of that [or light is simply the presence of light itself]. Empedocles (and with him all others who used the same forms of expression) was wrong in speaking of light as 'traveling' or being at a given moment between the earth and its envelope, its movement being unobservable by us; that view is contrary both to the clear evidence of argument and to the observed facts; if the distance traversed were short, the movement might have been unobservable, but where the distance is from extreme East to extreme West [i.e. at dawn light fills the entire sky which is a great distance therefore], the draught upon our powers of belief is too great.&quot; -- Aristotle &quot;On the Soul&quot; Book 2, Part 7. (Note: comments in brackets added for clarification.)

This indicates that the Greeks believed the speed of light to be infinite i.e. it was present in all places at once when it appeared.  This idea was not overturned even by Galileo who attempted to measure the speed of light in the 17th century and it continued to hold in Newton's day.

===The Euclidean Space===
Euclidean geometry mentioned earlier as a form of mathematics originating with the Greeks in about 300 B.C.E. is the mathematical abstraction and extension of ordinary three dimensional space. It can be described by the Cartesian system of coordinates.

In ''Euclid's Elements'', Euclidean space is &quot;flat&quot;. This flatness is obvious from Euclid's definition 23 which states: 'Parallel straight lines are straight lines which, being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely in both directions, do not meet one another in either direction.'

===Motion of Objects===
Classical mechanics is generally classified as pre-20th century mechanics.  Aristotle's views of motion held sway for 2,000 years until an Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) developed such ingenious and conclusive experimentation that it not only began the destruction of Aristotelian physics but demonstrated the absolute necessity of experimentation in science.

Galileo studied the physics of motion by performing experiments in which he was able to calculate the speed and acceleration of falling bodies.  He developed new theories to explain motion based upon his experiments.  Galileo made advancements in theoretical physics by postulating a theory of inertia contrary to any previous assumptions.  Galileo asserted his theory of motion which is stated as his Principle of Inertia:  &quot;A body moving on a level surface will continue in the same direction at constant speed unless disturbed.&quot;

Isaac Newton (1642-1727) capitalized upon Galileo's observations and created theories based upon this notion that objects tend to maintain momentum.  Newton was an English scientist who systemized and generalized the assumptions made by Galileo, extended the predictions of the theory, and put them in a way that could be described by mathematical formulae that could be tested.

A direct translation from the Latin of Newton's first law of motion with Newton's own explanation is: 

&quot;LAW I: Every body continues ever in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon. -- Projectiles continue ever in their motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity. A top, whose parts by their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is retarded by the air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, continue ever their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time.&quot;--end translation

Newton begins his Laws of Motion with Galileo's idea of inertia. Inertia in Newton's first law of motion is a concept and an assumption and therefore cannot be proven by experimentation or mathematics.  (Inertia has two meanings today, and later, under the heading &quot;inertia&quot;, the term ''inertia'' will be considered in its second definition which is measurable.)  But the idea of &quot;inertia&quot; that is present in Newton's first law is an imagined concept of Galileo that once you get something into momentum, it stays that way until a force affects it. In Newton's first law, ''rest'' is the state of zero momentum or zero movement, so that inertia can be simply stated as the tendency to maintain movement. The idea comes before the law and creates the law. Without the idea of inertia there are no Newtonian laws of motion. Working from Galileo's principle, Newton's reasoning was that Aristotle postulated continual circular movement in the heavens and that laws on earth were different for Aristotle because Aristotle believed the earth was at rest, a fixed motionless reference frame, and at the center of the universe. Newton knew the earth was not at rest since by Newton's time the Copernican system with the sun at the center was the generally accepted theory.  Therefore Newton realized that the same laws in the heavenly bodies had to apply for earthly bodies as well. Therefore the same maintenance of movement, inertia, that had been postulated to exist in celestial bodies had to exist on earth. It was  this reasoning that made Newton believe that something on earth was making things come to rest.  What Galileo called a disturbance, Newton called a ''force''.  Inertia was Newton's way of describing the &quot;default state&quot; of matter that we now consider a law of the universe. Aristotle had described the default state of earthly objects as &quot;rest&quot; (natural place). Newton contradicted or enlarged on the Aristotle default state and said that to the contrary the default state is &quot;inertia&quot; and upon that seminal idea built the laws of motion. Without the &quot;idea&quot;, the mental abstraction of &quot;inertia&quot;, Newton could have never formulated the Laws of Motion. 

Newton could then form his first law extrapolate how much force it would take to change the momentum of an object.  Newton therefore stated his Second Law of Motion thus:

&quot;LAW II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed. -- If a force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subducted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.&quot;

Newton here is basically saying that the change in the momentum of an object is proportional to the amount of force exerted upon the object.  He also states that the change in direction of momentum is determined by the angle from which the force is applied.  Interestly too, Newton is restating in his further explanation another prior idea of Galileo being what we call today the ''Galilean transformation'' or the addition of velocities.

An interesting fact when studying Newton's Laws of Motion from the Principia is that Newton himself does not explicitly write formulae for his laws which was common in scientific writings of that time period.  In fact, it is today commonly added when stating Newton's second law that Newton has said, &quot;and proportional to the mass of the object.&quot;  This however is not found in Newton's second law as directly translated above.  In fact, the idea of mass is not introduced until the third law.  However, it has been a common convention to describe law two of Newton in the mathematic formula '''F=ma''' where '''F''' is Force, '''a''' is acceleration and '''m''' is mass.  This is actually a combination of laws two and three of Newton expressed in a very useful form.  This formula in this form did not even begin to be used until the 18th century after Newton's death, but it is implicit in his laws.

Newton's Third Law of Motion states:  &quot;LAW III: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. -- Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone, as it does the stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other. If a body impinge upon another, and by its force change the motion of the other, that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change, in its own motion, toward the contrary part. The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions of the bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments. For, because the motions are equally changed, the changes of the velocities made toward contrary parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in the next scholium.&quot;

The explanation of mass is expressed here for the first time in the words &quot;reciprocally proportional to the bodies&quot; which have now been traditionally added to Law 2 as &quot;mutually proportional to the mass of the object.&quot;  Thus we arrive at '''F=ma'''.

Newton's Third Law of Motion also expresses one of the fundamental symmetry principles of the universe.  The idea is that forces in nature always exist in pairs. Newton's third law is often restated as, &quot;For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.&quot;

====Gravity====

&quot;I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve, and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth and found them to answer pretty nearly.&quot; -- Isaac Newton, 1667

Here Newton introduced a novel idea by imagining that the Earth's gravity influenced the moon, counter-balancing its orbital rotation about the earth. Newton deduces the inverse-square law. This inverse-square law had already been observed by Johannes Kepler in his book ''The Harmony of the World'' which contains what is now known as 'Kepler's Third Law', that for any two planets the ratio of the squares of their periods will be the same as the ratio of the cubes of the mean radii of their orbits. 

Kepler had merely made an observation from studying the data of astronomer Tycho Brahe for some twenty years.  Kepler did not understand why there was an inverse-square law, he merely stated this observation.  What Newton did was explain that the inverse-square law was caused by the force of gravity between two massive objects.

Newton wrote a full treatment of his new physics including his laws of motion and gravity and its application to astronomy which was published in 1687 and entitled ''Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica'' or commonly referred to as the ''Principia''. 

According to biographers J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, &quot;the Principia is recognised as the greatest scientific book ever written. Newton analysed the motion of bodies in resisting and non-resisting media under the action of centripetal forces. The results were applied to orbiting bodies, projectiles, pendulums, and free-fall near the Earth. He further demonstrated that the planets were attracted toward the Sun by a force varying as the inverse square of the distance and generalised that all heavenly bodies mutually attract one another. Further generalisation led Newton to the law of universal gravitation: &quot;... all matter attracts all other matter with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.&quot;

Newton had based much of his theory upon the observations of Galilieo.  Galileo had made a study of falling bodies and Galileo had observed that all bodies fall with the same acceleration.  The force of gravity was known before Newton's time, however, it had not been systematically explained.

What Galileo hadn't envisioned was that which was made clear in Newton's universal law of gravity, that the acceleration was proportional to the masses of the objects. In other words, Galileo would have never conceived of objects falling to earth at the same speed had the objects had masses comparable to the earth.  In other words, for objects on earth, the mass is so small compared to the mass of the earth that the mass of the object is negligible.
Therefore, for gravity measurements on Earth, acceleration is independent of the mass or weight of an object, and due to this all objects fall to the earth at 9.8 m/s^2.

This same negligible gravity of one object compared to another orbiting object helped Kepler in his third law to discover through observation the inverse-square law of the planetary orbits.  It is only due to the mass of the sun being so extraordinarily large compared to the masses of the planets that the mass of the planets becomes negligible in the formula.  Since Kepler did not understand the relation between mass and gravity, he would have never observed the inverse-square law had earth been comparable in mass to the sun.

So here we see in the development of theoretical physics the intertwining of observations with the development of theories of ''force'' and mathematics to explain the observations.  The theories advanced by Kepler and Galileo were correct on a simple level, but it was Newton who introduced ''force'' and the relation between force and ''mass'' in order to explain why these observations were accurate.  Obviously, the modern theories of physics and the description of universal laws did not develop in a vacuum.  Physicists built upon prior knowledge and prior ideas.  From these prior ideas, they produced new models of the natural world and made new inferences.  In their turn these new models made predictions and required new explanations so that sometimes the developing theories could only be explained by the introduction of a new force, or a new constant such as the gravitational constant, or a new universal law such as inertia.  Even Aristotle was working from prior notions that he systematically arranged into the first elements of theoretical physics.

====Constant Acceleration====
Galileo's third principle is summarized for falling bodies as: &quot;The distance fallen is proportional to the time squared '''&lt;math&gt;dt^2\,&lt;/math&gt;'''. &quot;

Galileo's third principle defines a constantly changing velocity.  When there is a change in velocity, it is called acceleration.  Therefore, bodies fall with a constant acceleration.

====Circular Motion====
To keep an object rotating in circular motion, it requires a centripetal force &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{mv^2} {r} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object,
&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the object and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the circle.

====Inertia====
The philosopher René Descartes (1596 - 1650) used the idea of a greater God and an infinite universe with no special or privileged place to articulate the concept of inertia: a body at rest remains at rest, and one moving in a straight line maintains a constant speed and same direction unless it is deflected by a 'force'. We can see this is borrowed from Galileo's principle of inertia and was later also incorporated into Newton's first law of motion.

Possibly the hardest difficulty for science to overcome has been the influence of religious and philosophical implications upon the theoretical science of physics.

Early researchers differed in their explanations of the fundamental nature of what we now call electromagnetic radiation. In 1690, Christian Huygens explained the laws of reflection and refraction on the basis of a wave theory. Sir Isaac Newton believed that light consists of particles which he designated corpuscles. In 1827 Thomas Young and Augustin Fresnel made experiments on interference that showed that a corpuscular theory of light was inadequate.  Then in 1873 James Clerk Maxwell showed that by making an electrical circuit oscillate it should be possible to produce electromagnetic waves. His theory made it possible to compute the speed of electromagnetic radiation purely on the basis of electrical and magnetic measurements, and the computed value corresponded very closely to the empirically measured speed of light.  In 1888, Heinrich Hertz made an electrical device that actually produced what we would now call microwaves — essentially radiation at a lower frequency than visible light.  Everything up to that point suggested that Newton had been entirely wrong to regard light as corpuscular. Then it was discovered that when light strikes an electrical conductor it causes electrons to move away from their original positions. Greater intensities of light at one frequency can cause more electrons to move, but they will not move any faster. Higher frequencies of light can cause electrons to move faster. This appeared to raise a contradiction.  Light had been shown by earlier experiments to be a wave and now in other experiments it appeared to behave as a particle.

===Quantum Mechanics===

==== Old quantum theory====

Quantum mechanics developed from the study of electromagnetic waves, which means visible light seen in the colors of the rainbow, but also other waves including the more energetic waves like ultraviolet light, x-rays, and gamma rays plus the waves with longer wavelengths including infrared waves, microwaves and radio waves.  We are not, however,  speaking of sound waves, but only of the waves that travel at the speed of light.  Also, when the word &quot;particle&quot; is used, it refers to elementary or subatomic particles.

====Planck's constant====
Without knowing it, Max Planck discovered that there is a definite relation between the frequency of light and the energy that it carries.  Planck actually was studying how the radiation of a body was related to its temperature in an attempt to devise a new radiation law.  Planck's investigation ended up describing the energy of a wave in mathematical terms.  So he took a small segment of a wave or as he called it &quot;an oscillator&quot; to describe the wave's total energy.  What he found concerning radiation and oscillators was really a description of electromagnetic waves. Waves have crests and troughs.  A cycle is the return from one point such as the crest to the next crest. So Planck used the frequency of the wave, which means the number of cycles per second, to determine the energy of a wave.  What he discovered was that, given any wave, a single number when multiplied by the frequency gives the energy of the wave. He found that this single number was the same for waves of all frequencies.  This number is called Planck's constant and represented as the letter '''h''' in physics formulas. If you know '''h''' (Plank's constant), and you know the frequency of the light, then you can calculate the energy delivered over a certain period of time. For instance, if a beam of light illuminated a target for 3 seconds, and the light frequency was  540 × 10¹² hertz, then the energy delivered would be '''h''' × 3 × 540 × 10¹² joules. The value of '''h''' itself is exceedingly small, about 0.000000000000000000000000000000000662618 joule.seconds (or 6.62618 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; joule seconds in scientific notation).

However, when you investigate the energy of a wave in this manner, it seems that the wave is carrying its energy in a given number of little packets per second.  This discovery then seemed to particalize a wave. These packets of energy along the wave were called quanta by Planck. Quantum mechanics began with the discovery that energy is delivered in these packets whose size is related to the color or frequency of the light.   

There originally were two competing ways to describe light, either as a wave propagated through empty space, or as small particles traveling in a straight line. Because Planck showed that the energy of the wave is made up of packets, the particle analogy became useful to help understand how light delivers energy in multiples of certain set values. Light of one frequency delivers multiples of a certain unit amount designated as a quantum of energy. Nevertheless, the wave analogy is useful to help understand other phenomena. In 1905, Albert Einstein used Planck's constant to postulate that the energy in a beam of light occurs in concentrations that he called photons. A single photon is a single quantum of energy, but the energy associated with a photon varies  depending upon the frequency of the wave. Photons can deliver more or less energy, depending on their frequency. This description sounds like Newton's corpuscular account except that a photon was said to have a frequency, and the energy of the photon was accounted proportional to its frequency. This explained all previous seeming contradictions in experiments where light sometimes displayed wave-like behavior and other times displayed particle-like behavior.

Both the idea of a wave and the idea of a particle are derived from our everyday experience. We cannot see photons. We can only investigate their properties indirectly. We look at some phenomena, such as the rainbow of colors that we see when a thin film of oil rests on the surface of a puddle of water, and we can explain that phenomenon to ourselves by saying that light is like waves.  We look at other phenomena, such as the way a photoelectric meter in our camera works, and we explain it by analogy to particles colliding with the detection screen in the meter.  In both cases we take concepts from our everyday experience and apply them to a world we have never seen. Neither form of explanation is entirely satisfactory. To remind us that both &quot;wave&quot; and &quot;particle&quot; are concepts imported from our macro world to explain the world of atomic-scale phenomena, some physicists such as George Gamow have used the term &quot;wavicle&quot; to refer to whatever it is that is really there. In the following discussion, &quot;wave&quot; and &quot;particle&quot; may both be used depending on which aspect of quantum mechanical phenomena is under discussion.

====Reduced Planck's constant====
Planck's constant originally represented the energy that a light wave carries as a function of its frequency. However, in 1925 when Werner Heisenberg developed his full quantum theory, which is discussed below, calculations involving wave analysis called Fourier series were fundamental, and so another version of Planck's constant showed up in the mathematical formula.  This &quot;reduced&quot; version of Planck's constant includes a conversion factor to make calculations involving wave analysis easier to deal with. It showed up again in 1927 in the Uncertainty Principle, also discussed later in this article.  Finally, this reduced Planck's constant appeared in Dirac's equation and was then given an alternate designation, &quot;Dirac's constant.&quot; Therefore, it is appropriate to begin with an explanation of what this constant is, even though we haven't yet touched on the theories that made its use convenient.

As noted above, the energy of any wave is its frequency multiplied by Planck's constant. A wave is made up of crests and troughs.  In a wave, a cycle is defined by the return from a certain position to the same position such as from the top of one crest to the next crest.  A cycle actually is mathematically related to a circle, and both have 360 degrees. A degree is a unit of measure for the amount of turn needed to produce a certain arc at a given distance. A sine curve is generated by a point on the circumference of a circle as that circle rotates. (See a demonstration at:  [http://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/ccli/bob/Rotation/sin12.swf Rotation Applet]) There are 2 pi radians per cycle in a wave, each having 180 degrees, which is similar to a circle where the radius times 2 times pi equals the circumference of the circle. Since one cycle is 2*pi*radian, when h is divided by 2pi this leaves radian. Therefore, dividing '''h''' by 2[[pi|&amp;pi;]] describes a constant that, when multiplied by the frequency of a wave, gives the energy in joules per radian per second.  And h/2pi is h-bar or &lt;math&gt; \hbar = \frac{h}{2 \pi} \ &lt;/math&gt;. 

The reduced Planck's constant is written in mathematical formulas as ''&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;'' and is simply called &quot;h-bar&quot;. So the reduced Planck's constant gives the energy of a wave in units per radian instead of units per cycle. However, the fundamental packet of energy is a photon derived from h describing a cycle of one quantum of energy.  The reduced Planck's constant merely divides the single quantum of energy into mathematically manageable parts.  

The two constants h and h-bar are merely conversion factors between energy units and frequency units. The reduced Planck's constant is used more often than ''h'' alone (Planck's constant) in quantum mechanical mathematical formulas for many reasons, one of which is that angular velocity or angular frequency is measured in radians per second. When equations relevant to those problems are written in terms of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;2 \pi \ &lt;/math&gt; factors in numerator and denominator can cancel out, saving a computation.

====Bohr atom====

[[Image:Bohr-planetary-atom-model.jpg|thumb|307px|The Bohr model of the atom&lt;br&gt;Showing electron quantum jumping to ground state n=1]] 

In 1897 the particle called the electron was discovered. By means of the gold foil experiment physicists discovered that the nucleus was at the center of the atom. So at first all scientists believed that the atom must be like a miniature solar system. But that simple analogy predicted that electrons would, within about one hundredth of a microsecond, crash into the nucleus of the atom. This is because the nucleus has a positive charge and the electron has a negative charge, and unlike charges attract.  The great question of the early 20th century was, &quot;Why do electrons normally maintain a stable orbit around the nucleus?&quot;

In 1913, Niels Bohr removed this substantial problem by applying the idea of discrete (non-continuous) quanta to the orbits of electrons.  This account became known as the Bohr model of the atom.  Bohr basically theorized that electrons can only inhabit certain orbits around the atom. These orbits could be derived even before the 1931 development of the electron microscope by looking at the [[Organic Chemistry/Spectroscopy|spectral lines]] produced by atoms.

The way that Bohr quantized the orbits of the electrons was by assuming that the angular momentum of each of the orbits was derived from the value of '''h''', Planck's constant. In 1913 Bohr considered the electron to be a small particle in a solar system type orbit. However, he took Planck's constant to be a fundamental division at the subatomic level.  Bohr argued that the orbits were circular and that the only allowed orbits had the angular momentum of some integral number times  '''h''' divided by 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  We know that h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Planck's constant.  Each orbit after the initial orbit has an angular momentum that is a multiple of h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Bohr's analysis of electron orbits as circular'''&lt;br&gt;A little math on circular orbits.  Bohr was very &lt;br&gt;familiar with the dynamics of simple circular &lt;br&gt;orbits in an inverse square field as described in &lt;br&gt;classical mechanics. &lt;br&gt;Simply explained: To find the acceleration of a &lt;br&gt;circle, place it inside the shape of a square &lt;br&gt;where tangents meet, then find the linear speed &lt;br&gt;along one side of the square, then square the &lt;br&gt;speed of one side to complete the speed of the &lt;br&gt;entire square, then divide by the radius of the &lt;br&gt;circle placed in the square to get the speed &lt;br&gt;around the circle.  Therefore, circular &lt;br&gt;(centripetal) acceleration is v squared over r &lt;br&gt;where v is speed and r is radius. The equation for &lt;br&gt;the centripetal acceleration is &lt;math&gt;a =v^2/r&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;br&gt;is, acceleration is inversely proportional to the &lt;br&gt;radius of the circle. If the radius is doubled, &lt;br&gt;then the acceleration is halved.&lt;br&gt;Also, Kepler's Third Law is that the radius cubed &lt;br&gt;equals the circumference of the orbit squared. &lt;br&gt;It immediately follows that the radius of any n &lt;br&gt;orbit is proportional to the orbit n squared, and &lt;br&gt;the speed in that orbit is proportional to 1/n. Speed&lt;br&gt; times radius gives angular momentum. That leaves &lt;br&gt;n-squared over n. It then follows that the angular &lt;br&gt;momentum for any orbit n is just proportional to &lt;br&gt;n. Bohr argued then that the angular momentum &lt;br&gt;in any orbit n was nKh, where h is Planck's &lt;br&gt;constant and K is some multiplying factor, the &lt;br&gt;same for all the orbits, which was later &lt;br&gt;determined to be 1/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;!--&amp;nbsp;  keeps booklike bottom margin --&gt;
&lt;/DIV&gt;

Bohr considered the circular orbit to be as one cycle in an oscillator (as in Planck's initial measurements to define the constant '''h''') which is similar to one cycle in a wave.  Therefore, the orbits per second of the electron around its nucleus would create a frequency. Multiplying the frequency of each orbit by Planck's constant '''h''' would give only certain allowed orbits, thus fixing the size of the orbits.   Through analysis (shown at [http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/Bohr_Atom/Bohr_Atom.html]) Bohr found that the first allowed orbit, called K, was equal to 1/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. This was the argument Bohr used to establish that angular momentum for his model is quantized in units h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. 

Bohr's theory showed electrons to be orbiting the nucleus of an atom in a way that was amazingly different from what we see in the world of our everyday experience.  He showed that when an electron changed orbits it did not move in a continuous trajectory from one orbit around the nucleus to another. Instead, it suddenly disappeared from its original orbit and reappeared in another orbit. Each distance at which an electron can orbit is a function of a quantized amount of energy.  The closer to the nucleus an electron orbits, the less energy it takes to remain in that orbital.  Electrons that absorb a photon gain a quantum of energy, so they jump to an orbit that is farther from the nucleus, while electrons that emit a photon lose a quantum of energy and so jump to an inner orbital. Electrons cannot gain or lose a fractional quantum of energy, and so, it is argued, they cannot have a position that is at a fractional distance between allowed orbitals. Allowed orbitals were designated as whole numbers using the letter '''n''' with the innermost orbital being designated n = 1, the next out being n = 2, and so on.  Any orbital with the same value of n is called an electron shell.

Bohr's model of the atom was essentially two-dimensional because it depicts electrons as particles in circular orbits.  In this context, two-dimensional means something that can be described on the surface of a plane.  One-dimensional means something that can be described by a line.  Because circles can be described by their radius, which is a line segment, sometimes Bohr's model of the atom is described as one-dimensional.

It was discussed between De Broglie, Schroedinger, Bore and Einstein what model of the atom was best suited to describe it and Bohr's model was universally accepted as the only viable solution.  Bohr however was making an assumption that since the first orbit K was found to have a value of 1/2r that all consecutive orbits should be multiplied by the first orbit, first by h, then 2h, then 3h, and so on.  This was assumed without proof.  The only circumstantial evidence was that the lines in the atomic spectrum only appeared in certain discrete places for each element, therefore, the orbits were in discrete places.  Bohr assumed they were multiples of ''h'' (Planck's constant) because ''h'' was how wave energy had been quantized.  The external link in the article [1], will show Bohr's model was made on unprovable assumptions as are most theories.  However, if Bohr's assumptions were true, then they would predict that the electron wouldn't fall into the nucleus of every atom.  So it was creating a theory to fit nature, not much different than when Aristotle said that all objects on earth come to rest in their own &quot;natural place&quot;.  In Bohr's time and even now, we still must believe that the orbits are quantized by h or else we have no other explanation for the electron not falling into the nucleus.   In the case of outer electrons, the dividing by 2pi is not a result of mathematical ease to arrive at the reduced Planck's constant, but rather the result of the first orbit being 1/2pi so all the other orbits were multiplied by integers of h and the first orbit of 1/2pi. There were other theories floating around in the early twentieth century.  After all, some force could be counter-balancing the electron away from the nucleus, but then electrons were also counter-balanced away from each other in their orbits, so there would have to be two new kinds of forces added for this type of theory.  Choosing Bohr's atom became a matter of Ockham's Razor i.e. the least amount of new assumptions as ''h'' was already known.

====Wave/Particle Duality====
Niels Bohr determined that it is impossible to describe light adequately either by sole use of the wave analogy or of the particle analogy. Therefore he enunciated the principle of complementarity which is a theory of pairs, such as, the pairing of wave and particle or the pairing of position and momentum. Louis de Broglie worked out the mathematical consequences of these findings. In quantum mechanics, it was found that electromagnetic waves could react in certain experiments as though they were particles and in other experiments as though they were waves.  It was also discovered that subatomic particles could sometimes be described as particles and sometimes as waves.  This discovery led to the theory of wave-particle duality by Louis-Victor de Broglie in 1924, which states that waves and particles have properties of both at the same time.

The Bohr atom model was enlarged upon with the discovery by de Broglie that the electron had wave-like properties. Therefore for Bohr's atom the orbit is only stable if it meets the condition for a standing wave. A standing wave can be made if a string is fixed on both ends and made to vibrate, then the only waves that can occur are those with zero amplitude at those fixed ends. The waves appear to oscillate in place simply changing crest for trough in an up-and-down motion. These vibrations are called standing waves.  If the string is made to form a circle in the same way that the wave of an electron forms a circle in its orbit in the Bohr atom, then a standing wave is formed when the wave fits the available space around the circle.  In other words, no partial fragments of wave crests or troughs are allowed.  The wave must be a continuous formation of crests and troughs all around the circle.

===Development of modern quantum mechanics===
====Full quantum mechanical theory====
Werner Heisenberg developed the full quantum mechanical theory in 1925 at the young age of 24.  Following his teacher, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg began to work out a theory for the quantum behavior of electron orbitals.  Because electron orbits could not be observed, Heisenberg went about creating a mathematical description of quantum mechanics built on what could be observed, that is, the light emitted from atoms in their atomic spectrum.  He used a form of mathematics related to the mathematics of arrays of numbers known as &quot;matrices.&quot; He worked from the observed atomic spectrum which only shows light emitted from electrons only at certain observed places.  Instead of trying to explain every possible orbit, he began with the assumption that electron orbitals that cannot be observed in the spectrum do not exist. By this time it was known that the electron orbital was three-dimensional, but trying to work out the mathematics for a three-dimensional atom proved too complicated, so he imagined the electron orbital flattened out to one dimension.  Heisenberg studied the electron orbital as a charged ball on a spring, an oscillator, whose motion was not quite regular called anharmonic. To see a picture of a charged ball on a spring see: [http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/waves_particles/wavpart4.html Vibrating Charges]. He used the laws of classical mechanics known in the macro world, then applied quantum properties which means discrete (non-continuous) properties to the motion which would leave the gaps between the orbitals so that the mathematics would represent only the observed electron orbitals.  The multiplication in his formula resulted in a type of mathematics that was used in special arrays of numbers called matrices.  This means in Heisenberg's quantum mechanical mathematics, the normal multiplication law of commutation where A x B = B X A didn't apply.  

Heisenberg was approaching quantum mechanics from the particle-like perspective of an oscillating charged electron.  Particles appeared to quantum jump due to Planck's constant which showed energy delivered in packets along the wave. Heisenberg was describing mathematically the intensity of a wave. The intensity is the energy per unit volume multiplied by the velocity at which the energy is moving. Amplitude is the maximum height of a wave crest or depth of a trough.
Amplitudes of position and momentum that have a period of 2 pi like a cycle in a wave are called Fourier series variables.  Heisenberg described the particle-like properties of the electron in a wave as having position and momentum in his matrix mechanics. When these amplitudes of position and momentum are measured and multiplied together, they give intensity. However, he found that when the position and momentum were multiplied together in that respective order, and then the momentum and position were multiplied together in that respective order, there was a difference or deviation in intensity between them of h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;.  As we have said earlier h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is h-bar and describes one cycle in the wave.  Heisenberg wouldn't understand the reason for this deviation for two more years, but for the time being he understood that the math worked and was an exact description of the quantum behavior of the electron.  Max Born reviewed Heisenberg's paper and recognized that this type of multiplication that couldn't be described by the property of commutation known in normal arithmetic was called matrix mathematics.

No one prior to this had applied this type of mathematics to quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's new matrix theory was able for the first time to fully calculate the quantum behavior of the electron and was later applied to all subatomic particles.

====Wave Functions====

Because particles could be described as waves, later in 1925 Erwin Schroedinger analyzed what an electron would look like as a wave around the nucleus of the atom.  He came up with a wave equation that describes each electron as having a wavefunction.  He thus showed that the atom was not at all like a miniature solar system, but that the electron in a hydrogen atom was more like a wave that covered the entire sphere of its orbital all at once meaning it was three-dimensional. Each electron has its own unique wavefunction described in Schroedinger's equation by three properties (later Paul Dirac added a fourth).  The three properties were 1.) which orbital meaning closer to the nucleus with less energy or further from the nucleus with more energy, 2.) the shape of the orbital meaning that orbitals were not just spherical but changed shapes, and 3.) the magnetic moment of the orbital which is a type of energy caused by the charge of the electron as it rotates around the nucleus.

These three properties were called collectively the wavefunction of the electron and are said to describe the quantum state of the electron.  &quot;Quantum state&quot; means the collective properties of the electron describing what we can say about its condition at a given time. For the electron, the quantum state is described by its wavefunction which is designated in physics by the Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; (psi pronounced &quot;sigh&quot;).  The three properties of Schroedinger's equation that describe the wavefunction of the electron and therefore also describe the quantum state of the electron as described in the previous paragraph are each called quantum numbers.  The first property which describes the orbital was numbered according to Bohr's model where ''n'' is the letter used to describe the energy of each orbital.  This is called the principal quantum number.  The next quantum number that describes the shape of the orbital is called the azimuthal quantum number and it is represented by the letter ''l'' (lower case L).  The shape is caused by the angular momentum of the orbital.  Angular momentum measures an object's tendency to continue to spin. The azimuthal quantum number ''&quot;l&quot;'' represents the orbital angular momentum of the electron around the nucleus. However the shape of each orbital has its own letter as well.  So for the letter ''&quot;l&quot;'' there are other letters to describe the shapes of ''&quot;l&quot;''.  The first shape is spherical and is described by the letter ''s''.  The next shape is like a dumbbell and is described by the letter ''p''.  The other shapes of orbitals become more complicated and are described by the letters ''d'', ''f'', and ''g''.  The third quantum number of Schroedinger's equation describes the magnetic moment of the electron and is designated by the letter ''m'' and sometimes as the letter ''m'' with a subscript ''l'' because the magnetic moment depends upon the second quantum number ''l''.

In May 1926 Schrödinger published a proof that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Shroedinger's wave mechanics gave equivalent results: mathematically they were the same theory.  Both men claimed to have the superior theory.  Heisenberg insisted on the existence of discontinuous quantum jumps in his particle-like examination of the oscillation of a charged electron giving more precise definitions and Schroedinger insisted that a theory based on continuous wave-like properties which he called &quot;matter-waves&quot; was better.

====Uncertainty Principle====

|}

In 1927, Heisenberg made a new discovery from his quantum theory that had further practical consequences of this new way of looking at matter and energy on the atomic scale. In Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formula, Heisenberg had encountered an error or difference of h/2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; between position and momentum.  This represented a deviation of one radian of a cycle when the particle-like aspects of the wave were examined.  Heisenberg analyzed this difference of one radian of a cycle and divided the difference or deviation of one radian equally between the measurement of position and momentum. This had the consequence of being able to describe the electron as a point particle in the center of one cycle of a wave so that its position would have a standard deviation of plus or minus one-half of one radian of the cycle (1/2 of h-bar). A standard deviation can be either plus or minus the measurement i.e. it can add to the measurement or subtract from it. In three-dimensions a standard deviation is a displacement in any direction. What this means is that when a moving particle is viewed as a wave it is less certain where the particle is.  In fact, the more certain the position of a particle is known, the less certain the momentum is known.  This conclusion came to be called &quot;Heisenberg's Indeterminacy Principle,&quot; or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  To understand the real idea behind the uncertainty principle imagine a wave with its undulations, its crests and troughs, moving along. A wave is also a moving stream of particles, so you have to superimpose a stream of particles moving in a straight line along the middle of the wave. An oscillating ball of charge creates a wave larger than its size depending upon the length of its oscillation. Therefore, the energy of a moving particle is as large as the cycle of the wave, but the particle itself has a location. Because the particle and the wave are the same thing, then the particle is really located somewhere in the width of the wave. Its position could be anywhere from the crest to the trough. The math for the uncertainty principle says that the measurement of uncertainty as to the position of a moving particle is one-half the width from the crest to the trough or one-half of one radian of a cycle in a wave.

For moving particles in quantum mechanics, there is simply a certain degree of exactness and precision that is missing. You can be precise when you take a measurement of position and you can be precise when you take a measurement of momentum, but there is an inverse imprecision when you try to measure both at the same time as in the case of a moving particle like the electron. In the most extreme case, absolute precision of one variable would entail absolute imprecision regarding the other. 

The consequences of the uncertainty principle were that the electron could no longer be considered as in an exact location in its orbital.  Rather the electron had to be described by every point where the electron could possibly inhabit.  By creating points of probable location for the electron in its known orbital, this created a cloud of points in a spherical shape for the orbital of a hydrogen atom which points gradually faded out nearer to the nucleus and farther from the nucleus.  This is called a probability distribution.  Therefore, the Bohr atom number ''n'' for each orbital became known as an ''n-sphere'' in the three dimensional atom and was pictured as a probability cloud where the electron surrounded the atom all at once.

This led to the further description by Heisenberg that if you were not making measurements of the electron that it could not be described in one particular location but was everywhere in the electron cloud at once. In other words, quantum mechanics cannot give exact results, but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible results.  Heisenberg went further and said that the path of a moving particle only comes into existence once we observe it. However, strange and counter-intuitive this may seem, quantum mechanics however does tell us the location of the electron's orbital, its probability cloud.  Heisenberg was speaking of the particle itself, not its orbital which is in a known probability distribution. 

Classical physics had shown since Newton that if you know the position of stars and planets and details about their motions that you can predict where they will be in the future.  For subatomic particles, Heisenberg denied this notion showing that due to the uncertainty principle one cannot know the precise position and momentum of a particle at a given instant, so its future motion cannot be determined, but only a range of possibilities for the future motion of the particle can be described. 

These notions arising from the uncertainty principle only arise at the subatomic level and were a consequence of wave-particle duality.  As counter-intuitive as they may seem, quantum mechanical theory with its uncertainty principle has been responsible for major improvements in the world's technology from computer components to fluorescent lights to brain scanning techniques.

====Wavefunction collapse====
Schroedinger's wave equation with its unique wavefunction for a single electron is also spread out in a probability distribution like Heisenberg's quantized particle-like electron.  This is because a wave is naturally a widespread disturbance and not a point particle.  Therefore, Schroedinger's wave equation has the same predictions made by the uncertainty principle because uncertainty of location is built into the definition of a widespread disturbance like a wave.  Uncertainty only needed to be defined from Heisenberg's matrix mechanics because the treatment was from the particle-like aspects of the electron.  Schroedinger's wave equation shows that the electron is in the probability cloud at all times in its probability distribution as a wave that is spread out.  Therefore, in Schroedinger's equation when you measure the position of an electron, it ceases to have wave-like properties. Without wave-like properties, none of Schroedinger's definitions of the electron being wave-like make sense anymore.  The measurement of the position of the particle nullifies the wave-like properties and Schroedinger's equation then fails.  Because the electron can no longer be described by its wavefunction when measured due to it becoming particle-like, this is called wavefunction collapse.

====Eigenstates and eigenvalues====
The term eigenstate is derived from the German word ''&quot;eigen,&quot;'' which means &quot;inherent&quot; or &quot;characteristic.&quot; The word eigenstate is descriptive of the measured state of some entity that possesses quantifiable characteristics such as position, momentum, etc. The state being measured and described must be an &quot;observable&quot; (i.e. something that can be observed and measured like position or momentum), and must have a definite value. In the everyday world, it is natural and intuitive to think of everything being in its own eigenstate. Everything appears to have a definite position, a definite momentum, a definite value of measure, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics affirms that it is impossible to pinpoint exact values for the momentum of a certain particle like an electron in a given location at a particular moment in time, or, alternatively, that it is impossible to give an exact location for such an object when the momentum has been measured. Due to the inevitable disturbance of the entity being measured by the very act of measurement, statements regarding both the position and momentum of particles can only be given in terms of a range of probabilities, a &quot;probability distribution.&quot; Eliminating uncertain in one term maximizes uncertainty in regard to the second parameter.  

Therefore it became necessary to have a way to clearly formulate the difference between the state of something that is uncertain in the way just described, such as an electron in a probability cloud, and effectively contrast it to the state of something that is not uncertain, something that has a definite value. When something is in the condition of being definitely &quot;pinned-down&quot; in some regard, it is said to possess an '''eigenstate'''. If the position of, e.g., an electron has been made definite, it is said to have an eigenstate of position.  

A definite value, such as the position of an electron that has been successfully located,  is called the '''eigenvalue''' of the eigenstate of position.  The German word ''&quot;eigen&quot;'' was first used in this context by the mathematician David Hilbert in 1904. Schroedinger's wave equation gives wavefunction solutions, meaning the possibilities where the electron might be, just as does Heisenberg's probability distribution. As stated above, when a wavefunction collapse occurs because something has been done to locate the position of an electron, the electron's state becomes an eigenstate of position, meaning that the position has a known value.

====Dirac wave equation====
In 1928, Paul Dirac worked out a variation of Schroedinger's equation that accounted for a fourth property of the electron in its orbital.  There was a doublet meaning a pair of lines in the spectrum of a hydrogen atom that was unaccounted for.  This meant that there was more energy in the electron orbital from magnetic moment than had previously been described. Wolfgang Pauli when studying alkali metals had introduced what he called a &quot;two-valued quantum degree of freedom&quot; associated with the electron in the outermost shell. This led to the Pauli Exclusion Principle that predicted that no more than two electrons can inhabit the same orbital.  It also predicted that any neutron, electron, or proton (types of fermions) could not exist in the same quantum state.  We learned in Schroedinger's equation that there were three quantum states of the electron, but if two electrons could be in the same orbital, there had to be another quantum number to distinguish those two electrons from each other and to describe the extra magnetic moment shown in the atomic spectrum. In early 1925, the young physicist Ralph Kronig had introduced a theory to Pauli that the electron rotates in space in the same way that the earth rotates on its axis.  This would account for the missing magnetic moment and allow for two electrons in the same orbital to be different if their spin was in opposite directions to each other thus satisfying the Exclusion Principle. So Paul Dirac introduced the fourth quantum number called the spin quantum number designated by the letter ''s'' to the new Dirac equation of the wavefunction of the electron.  In 1930, Dirac combined Heisenberg's matrix mechanics with Schroedinger's wave mechanics into a single quantum mechanical representation in his ''Principles of Quantum Mechanics''.  The quantum picture of the electron was now complete.

All of the above development of quantum theory was based mainly on the spectroscopy|atomic spectrum of the hydrogen atom.  This is due to the fact that each atom of each element produces a unique pattern of spectral lines when light from each different kind of element is passed through a prism.  Scientists could not study the electron and nucleus of the atom itself because they cannot be seen.  Even today with High-resolution Scanning Tunneling Electron Microscopes we can only get images of the atom as a blurry fuzzball. However, the spectral lines of the atom reveal the orbits of electrons and the energy that can be expected.  It was basically this study of the spectroscopic analysis of first the hydrogen atom and then the helium atom that led to quantum theory.  Therefore, the mathematical formula were made to fit the picture of the atomic spectrum.  That is why quantum mechanics is sometimes referred to as a form of mathematical physics.

====Quantum entanglement====
However, it took a great mind to challenge quantum mechanics and to further define a concept hidden in Heisenberg's quantum theory.  That mind was Albert Einstein who rejected Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  Collectively, Heisenberg's quantum mechanics based on Bohr's initial explanation became known as the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics by detractors.  Einstein, in trying to show that it was not a complete theory, recognized that the theory predicted that two or more particles which have interacted in the past exhibit surprisingly strong correlations when various measurements are made on them.  Einstein called this &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;.  In 1935, Schroedinger published a paper explaining the argument which had been denoted the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument.  Einstein showed that the Copenhagen Interpretation predicted quantum entanglement which he was trying to prove was incorrect in that it would defy physics.  Quantum entanglement means that when there is a change in one particle at a distance from another particle then the other particle automatically changes to counter-balance the system.  In quantum entanglement measuring one entangled particle defines its properties and seems to influence the properties of its partner or partners instantaneously no matter how far apart they are. Due to the fact that the two particles are entangled interaction on the one causes instantaneous effects on the other. Einstein had calculated that quantum theory would predict this, he saw it as a flaw and therefore challenged it. However, instead of showing a weakness in quantum mechanics, this forced quantum mechanics to acknowledge that quantum entanglement did in fact exist and it became another foundation theory of quantum mechanics.

There is a lot of controversy over quantum mechanics, historically, by physicists involved in the theory themselves. It is because the theory was sort of an ad hoc theory to make mathematics that fit the measurements of the atomic spectrum that it is so controversial and has been attacked by Albert Einstein, Erwin Shroedinger, Alfred Lande and many other physicists involved in its development. The theory itself was a shot in the dark similar to the Ptolemian earth-centered solar system. The system of Ptolemy was a great theory with the earth at the center. It worked very well to predict all the movements of the planets with great accuracy even including retrograde motion. In fact, when Copernicus came up with his sun-centered solar system model, it didn't predict the position of the planets nearly as well as the earth-centered system because Copernicus still used absolutely circular orbits. It wasn't until Galileo saw through the telescope that Venus went through all its phases that it could be proven beyond a doubt that the sun was at the center. Today Quantum Mechanics works like Ptolemy's earth-centered solar system. It may not be reality (even according to Niels Bohr), but it sure predicts things very well. Once a better microscope (analogous to Galileo's telescope) is invented that can actually see the atomic structure, quantum mechanics will probably be overturned. There is so much information on the controversy over quantum mechanics that it would make an interesting article just quoting the physicists who invented it and Einstein who rejected many of its principles. However, quantum mechanics is so extremely useful in predicting outcomes at the atomic level in our present state of technology that it probably won't be revised for some time to come.

'''Jalebi''' is a syrupy sweet that is shaped like a slightly large, chaotic pretzel and is traditionally prepared in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. Well-made jalebi has a tart element with a sweet taste.

==Ingredients==
===Jalebi batter===
* 3 cups all-purpose  [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Besan|gram flour]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 5 cups water

===Syrup===
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 cups of water
* ⅛ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]
* red and yellow food coloring
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Rosewater|rosewater]]

3 cups of vegetable [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for deep frying

==Procedure==
# Mix up the batter ingredients until smooth.
# Let the batter sit unrefrigerated and uncovered overnight (about 12 hours).
# Mix the sugar, water, and cream of tartar for the syrup.
# Stir the syrup over moderate heat until the sugar is dissolved.
# Put on high heat and boil for 5 minutes. 
# Let the syrup cool, and stir in the rosewater and food coloring (color it to light orange).
# Put the vegetable oil in a wide [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]]-like dish, and heat to about 350°F (175°C).
# Put the batter into a pastry bag with about a ¼ inch opening. If it is too dry to squeeze out, mix in a bit of water.
# Squeeze the batter into the oil, making a couple of figure 8s and loops on top of each other. The shape should be about 3 inches on its longest side.
# Fry each jalebi until golden brown. Remove, let the oil drain off, then soak in syrup for a minute.

Serves 7.

'Philosophical ethics could be called the study of what is good and bad'? - I would question this as being a definition of Ethics! That 'good' and 'bad' exist by themselves, I find a difficult assumption.

I think a better definition would be &quot;Ethics is the study of how one ought to live,&quot;&quot;Ethics is the study of what makes for the best life,&quot; or some more eloquently written equivalent.  In general I don't see how this page in it's current state is informative.  Would anyone object if I began to edit it?

Terrible. Simply too many flaws in the 'introduction' to list. 

== Introduction to Philosophy:  What is Ethics? ==

The heading here correctly says &quot;What is Ethics?&quot;

The link to it, however, says &quot;What are Ethics?&quot;

Also many of the subjects overlap, making it hard to distinguish between the three documents 
&quot;what is ethics?&quot;
&quot;what is ethics&quot;
and &quot;introduction to philosophy/what is ethics&quot;

all three of these should be combined or layed out in such a way that there is little or no overlap

'''Shortening''' is a [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] used in cooking. Modern shortening is a vegetable-based product that is just barely solid at room temperature. Shortening has a higher [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] than [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] and [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] (it is less flammable), leading to its use in [[Cookbook:Deep_frying|deep-fat frying]] and as a pan coating to prevent baked goods from sticking. It is also sometimes used as an ingredient, when a recipe needs a flavorless fat thicker than oil but thinner than margarine. Shortening has 100% fat content, compared to 80% for butter and margarine.

Shortening is so called because it gives a &quot;short&quot; texture (as in [[Cookbook:Shortbread|shortbread]]). '''Crisco''', a popular brand, was first produced in 1911. Shortening was once made from animal fat ([[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]). 

Refrigeration is a good idea, because the [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]]-like foods commonly made with shortening will turn out best if everything ([[Cookbook:Ingredients|ingredients]], air, [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]], work surface, bowls, etc.) is kept cold until [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]].

Until recently, shortening was almost always made of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Partially hydrogenated oil contains ''trans-'' fats, which have been implicated in causing heart disease. Newer products avoid ''trans-'' fats by using a mixture of unhydrogenated oil and fully hydrogenated oil. All vegetable-based shortenings are cholesterol-free.

Butter or margarine, mixed with vegetable oil to thin it, can replace shortening used to prevent baked goods from sticking or used as an ingredient. One way is to use lard or bacon grease, as was tradition. Lard is a particularly good substitute, producing the very best pastry crusts while having less saturated fat than butter.

= Introduction =
This wikibook should try to accomplish two goals: it should provide an overview of the history of cinema in general (two versions: one brief and one comprehensive), and it should be a set of sub-projects covering individual topics in great depth.  There are links for a few basic topics, each of which I would expect to see come up periodically at most universities either as a film course or as a large section of a film course (e.g., you don't often see German Expressionism as a course itself, but it will always show up as a section of any course surveying film as a whole, or prewar European cinema, etc.).

There shouldn't be any limits as to what sort of topic a module should try to cover (it could be as small a subject as Italian Futurism), but if the number of modules becomes unwieldy, it might be prudent to group some together into a single link that would just be a landing page for a collection of modules (e.g., &quot;Modules on individual directors&quot;).

Additionally, each module should contain a list of films within the topic (or in the comprehensive modules, films mentioned as being particularly significant in the development of cinema) that are available on dvd, possibly grouped into two or more categories: particularly those that are necessary for fully understanding the topic, and those that merely contribute to understanding the topic.

== Object orientation in Ada ==

Object oriented programming consists in building the software in terms of &quot;objects&quot;.  An &quot;object&quot; contains data and has a behavior.  The data, normally, consists in constants and variables as seen in the rest of this book but could also, conceivably, reside outside the program entirely, i.e. on disk or on the network.  The behavior consists in subprograms that operate on the data.  What makes Object Orientation unique, compared to procedural programming, is not a single feature but the combination of several features:

* ''encapsulation'', i.e. the ability to separate the implementation of an object from its interface; this in turn separates &quot;clients&quot; of the object, who can only use the object in certain predefined ways, from the internals of the object, which have no knowledge of the outside clients.

* ''inheritance'', the ability for one type of objects to inherit the data and behavior (subprograms) of another, without necessarily needing to break encapsulation;

* ''type extension'', the ability for an object to add new data components and new subprograms on top of the inherited ones and to ''replace'' some inherited subprograms with its own versions; this is called ''overriding''.

* ''polymorphism'', the ability for a &quot;client&quot; to use the services of an object without knowing the exact type of the object, i.e. in an abstract way.  The actual type of the object can indeed change at run time from one invocation to the next.

It is possible to do object-oriented programming in any language, even assembly.  However, type extension and polymorphism are very difficult to get right without language support.

In Ada, each of these concepts has a matching construct; this is why Ada supports object-oriented programming directly.

* Packages provide encapsulation;
* Derived types provide inheritance;
* Record extensions, described below, provide for type extension;
* Class-wide types, also described below, provide for polymorphism.

Ada has had encapsulation and derived types since the first version (MIL-STD-1815 in 1980), which led some to qualify the language as &quot;object-oriented&quot; in a very narrow sense.  Record extensions and class-wide types were added in Ada 95.  Ada 2005 further adds interfaces.  The rest of this chapter covers these aspects.

=== The simplest object: the Singleton ===

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Directory {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Present (Name_Pattern: String) {{Ada/kw|return}} Boolean;
   {{Ada/kw|generic}}
      {{Ada/kw|with procedure}} Visit (Full_Name, Phone_Number, Address: String;
                            Stop: {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean);
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Iterate (Name_Pattern: String);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Directory;

The Directory is an object consisting of data (the telephone numbers and addresses, presumably held in an external file or database) and behavior (it can look an entry up and traverse all the entries matching a Name_Pattern, calling Visit on each).

A simple package provides for encapsulation (the inner workings of the directory are hidden) and a pair of subprograms provide the behavior.

This pattern is appropriate when only one object of a certain type must exist; there is, therefore, no need for type extension or polymorphism.

=== Primitive operations ===

For the following, we need the definition of primitive operations:

The set of ''primitive operations of a type T'' consists of those subprograms that:

* are declared immediately within the same package as the type (not within a nested package nor a child package);
* take a parameter of the type or, for functions, ''return'' an object of the type;
* take an access parameter of the type or, for functions, ''return'' an access value of the type.

(Also predefined operators like equality &quot;=&quot; are primitive operations.)

An operation can be primitive on two or more types, but only on one tagged type. The following example would be illegal if also B were tagged.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} A {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|type}} B {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Proc (This: A; That: B); {{Ada/comment|primitive on A and B}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

=== Derived types ===

Type derivation has been part of Ada since the very start.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is private}};
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Create (Data: Boolean) {{Ada/kw|return}} T;  {{Ada/comment|primitive}}
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Work (Object : {{Ada/kw|in out}} T);        {{Ada/comment|primitive}}
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Work (Pointer: {{Ada/kw|access}} T);        {{Ada/comment|primitive}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Acc_T {{Ada/kw|is access}} T;
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Proc (Pointer: Acc_T);           {{Ada/comment|not primitive}}
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is record}}
     Data: Boolean;
   {{Ada/kw|end record}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

The above example creates a type T that contains data (here just a Boolean but it could be anything) and behavior consisting of some subprograms.  It also demonstrates encapsulation by placing the details of the type T in the private part of the package.

The primitive operations of T are the function Create, the overloaded procedures Work, and the predefined &quot;=&quot; operator; Proc is not primitive, since it has an ''access type'' on T as parameter — don't confuse this with an ''access parameter'', as used in the second procedure Work. When deriving from T, the primitive operations are inherited.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} P;
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Q {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is new}} P.T;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Q;

The type Q.Derived has the same data ''and the same behavior'' as P.T; it inherits both the data ''and the subprograms''.  Thus it is possible to write:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Q;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Object: Q.Derived := Q.Create (Data =&gt; False);
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   Q.Work (Object);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Main;

Admittedly, the reasons for writing this may seem obscure.
The purpose of this kind of code is to have objects of types P.T and Q.Derived, which are not compatible:

 Ob1: P.T;
 Ob2: Q.Derived;
 
 Ob1 := Ob2;        -- illegal
 Ob1 := P.T (Ob2);  -- but convertible

This feature is not used very often (it's used e.g. for declaring types reflecting physical dimensions) but I present it here to introduce the next step: type extension.

=== Type extensions ===

Type extensions are an Ada 95 amendment.

A tagged type provides support for dynamic polymorphism and type extension. A tagged type bears a hidden tag that identifies the type at run-time.  Apart from the tag, a tagged record is like any other record, so it can contain arbitrary data.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
      {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Name   : String (1 .. 10);
          Gender : Gender_Type;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (O : Object);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Person;

As you can see, a &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; is an ''object'' in the sense that it has data and behavior (the procedure &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt;).  However, this object does not hide its data; any program unit that has a &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|with}} Person&lt;/code&gt; clause can read and write the data in a Person.Object directly.  This breaks encapsulation and also illustrates that Ada completely separates the concepts of ''encapsulation'' and ''type''.  Here is a version of Person.Object that encapsulates its data:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged private}};
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (O : Object);
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
      {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Name   : String (1 .. 10);
          Gender : Gender_Type;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Person;

Because the type Person.Object is tagged, it is possible to create a record extension, which is a derived type with additional data.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Person;
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object {{Ada/kw|with private}};
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object {{Ada/kw|with}} 
      {{Ada/kw|record}}
         Skilled_In : Language_List;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Programmer;

The type &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt; inherits the data and behavior, i.e. the type's primitive operations, from &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;; it is thus possible to write:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Programmer;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Me : Programmer.Object;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Programmer.Put (Me);
    Me.Put; {{Ada/comment|equivalent to the above, Ada 2005 only}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Main;

So the declaration of the type &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt;, as a record extension of &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;, implicitly declares a &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put&lt;/code&gt; that applies to a &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt;.

Like in the case of untagged types, objects of type Person and Programmer are convertible. However, where untagged objects are convertible in either direction, conversion of tagged types only works in the direction to the root. (Conversion away from the root would have to add components out of the blue.) Such a conversion is called a ''view conversion'', because components are not lost, they only become invisible.

Extension aggregates have to be used if you go away from the root.

=== Overriding ===

Now that we have introduced tagged types, record extensions and primitive operations, it becomes possible to understand overriding.   In the examples above, we introduced a type &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; with a primitive operation called &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt;.  Here is the body of the package:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Text_IO;
 {{Ada/kw|package body}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (O : Object) {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       Ada.Text_IO.Put (O.Name);
       Ada.Text_IO.Put (&quot; is a &quot;);
       Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (Gender_Type'Image (O.Gender));
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Put;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Person;

As you can see, this simple operation prints both data components of the record type to standard output.  Now, remember that the record extension &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt; has an additional data member.  If we write:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Programmer;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Me : Programmer.Object;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Programmer.Put (Me);
    Me.Put; {{Ada/comment|equivalent to the above, Ada 2005 only}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Main;

then the program will call the inherited primitive operation &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt;, which will print the name and gender ''but not the additional data''.  In order to provide this extra behavior, we must ''override'' the inherited procedure &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; like this:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Person;
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object {{Ada/kw|with private}};
    {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/comment|Optional keyword, new in Ada 2005}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (O : Object);
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object {{Ada/kw|with}} 
      {{Ada/kw|record}}
         Skilled_In : Language_List;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Programmer;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package body}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (O : Object) {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|begin}}
       Person.Put (Person.Object (O)); {{Ada/comment|view conversion to the ancestor type}}
       Put (O.Skilled_In); {{Ada/comment|presumably declared in the same package as Language_List}}
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Put;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Programmer;

&lt;code&gt;Programmer.Put&lt;/code&gt; ''overrides'' &lt;code&gt;Person.Put&lt;/code&gt;; in other words it ''replaces'' it completely.  Since the intent is to extend the behavior rather than replace it, &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Put&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;Person.Put&lt;/code&gt; as part of its behavior.  It does this by converting its parameter from the type &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt; to its ancestor type &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;.  This construct is a ''view conversion''; contrary to a normal type conversion, it does ''not'' create a new object and does ''not'' incur any run-time cost.  Of course, it is optional that an overriding operation call its ancestor; there are cases where the intent is indeed to replace, not extend, the inherited behavior.

(Note that also for untagged types, overriding of inherited operations is possible. The reason why it's discussed here is that derivation of untagged types is done rather seldom.)

=== Polymorphism, class-wide programming and dynamic dispatching ===

The full power of object orientation is realized by polymorphism, class-wide programming and dynamic dispatching, which are different words for the same, single concept.  To explain this concept, let us extend the example from the previous sections, where we declared a base tagged type &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; with a primitive operation &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; and a record extension &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt; with additional data and an overriding primitive operation &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt;.

Now, let us imagine a collection of persons.  In the collection, some of the persons are programmers.  We want to traverse the collection and call &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; on each person.  When the person under consideration is a programmer, we want to call &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Put&lt;/code&gt;; when the person is not a programmer, we want to call &lt;code&gt;Person.Put&lt;/code&gt;.  This, in essence, is polymorphism, class-wide programming and dynamic dispatching.

Ada implements this concept by means of ''class-wide types''.

Each tagged type, such as &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;, has a corresponding ''class of types'' which is the set of types comprising the type &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; itself and all types that extend &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;.  In our example, this class consists of two types:

* &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt;

Ada 95 defines the &lt;code&gt;Person.Object'Class&lt;/code&gt; attribute to denote the corresponding class-wide type. In other words:

 {{ada/kw|declare}}
    Someone : Person.Object'Class := ...; {{ada/comment|to be expanded later}}
 {{ada/kw|begin}}
    Someone.Put; {{ada/comment|dynamic dispatching}}
 {{ada/kw|end}};

The declaration of Someone denotes an object that may be of ''either'' type, &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt;.  Consequently, the call to the primitive operation &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; dispatches dynamically to either &lt;code&gt;Person.Put&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Put&lt;/code&gt;.

The only problem is that, since we don't know whether Someone is a programmer or not, we don't know how many data components Someone has, either, and therefore we don't know how many bytes Someone takes in memory.  For this reason, the class-wide type &lt;code&gt;Person.Object'Class&lt;/code&gt; is [[ada Programming/Subtypes#Indefinite_subtype|''indefinite'']].  It is impossible to declare an object of this type without giving some constraint.  It is, however, possible to:

* declare an object of a class-wide with an initial value (as above). The object is then constrained by its initial value.
* declare an ''access value'' to such an object (because the access value has a known size); 
* pass objects of a class-wide type as parameters to subprograms
* assign an object of a specific type (in particular, the result of a function call) to a variable of a class-wide type.

With this knowledge, we can now build a polymorphic collection of persons; in this example we will quite simply create an array of access values to persons:

 {{ada/kw|with}} Person;
 {{ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{ada/kw|is}}
    {{ada/kw|type}} Person_Access {{ada/kw|is access}} Person.Object'Class;
    {{ada/kw|type}} Array_Of_Persons  {{ada/kw|is array}} (Positive {{ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) of Person_Access;
 
    {{ada/kw|function}} Read_From_Disk {{ada/kw|return}} Array_Of_Persons {{ada/kw|is separate}};
 
    Everyone : {{ada/kw|constant}} Array_Of_Persons := Read_From_Disk;
 {{ada/kw|begin}} {{Ada/comment|Main}}
    {{ada/kw|for}} K {{Ada/kw|in}} Everyone'Range {{ada/kw|loop}}
       Everyone (K).{{Ada/kw|all}}.Put; {{Ada/comment|dereference followed by dynamic dispatching}}
    {{ada/kw|end loop}};
 {{ada/kw|end}} Main;

The above procedure achieves our desired goal: it traverses the array of Persons and calls the procedure &lt;code&gt;Put&lt;/code&gt; that is appropriate for each person.

==== Advanced topic: How dynamic dispatching works ====

You don't need to know how dynamic dispatching works in order to use it effectively but, in case you are curious, here is an explanation.

The first component of each object in memory is the ''tag''; this is why objects are of a ''tagged'' type rather than plain records.  The tag really is an access value to a table; there is one table for each specific type.
The table contains access values to each primitive operation of the type.
In our example, since there are two types &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt;, there are two tables, each containing a single access value.
The table for &lt;code&gt;Person.Object&lt;/code&gt; contains an access value to &lt;code&gt;Person.Put&lt;/code&gt; and the table for &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Object&lt;/code&gt; contains an access value to &lt;code&gt;Programmer.Put&lt;/code&gt;.
When you compile your program, the compiler constructs both tables and places them in the program executable code.

Each time the program creates a new object of a specific type, it automatically sets its tag to point to the appropriate table.

Each time the program calls a primitive operation, the compiler inserts object code that:

* dereferences the tag to find the table of primitive operations for the specific type of the object at hand
* dereferences the access value to the primitive operation
* calls the primitive operation.

When you perform a view conversion to an ancestor type, the compiler performs these two dereferences at compile time rather than run time: this is ''static dispatching''; the compiler emits code that directly calls the primitive operation of the ancestor type specified in the view conversion.

==== Redispatching ====

Dispatching works on the (hidden) tag of the object. So what happens when a primitive operation Op1 calls another primitive operation Op2? Which operation will be called when Op1 is called by dispatching?

  {{ada/kw|type}} Root {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|private}};
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op1 (This: Root);
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op2 (This: Root);
 
  {{ada/kw|type}} Derived {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|new}} Root {{ada/kw|with}} {{ada/kw|private}};
  -- Derived inherits Op1
  {{ada/kw|overriding}} {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op2 (This: Derived);
 
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op1 (This: Root) {{ada/kw|is}}
  {{ada/kw|begin}}
    ...
    Op2 (This);               -- not redispatching
    Op2 (Root'Class (This));  -- redispatching
    This.Op2                  -- not redispatching (new syntax since Ada 2005)
    (Root'Class (This)).Op2   -- redispatching (new syntax since Ada 2005)
    ...
  {{ada/kw|end}} Op1;
 
  D: Derived;
  C: Root'Class := D;
 
  Op1 (D);  -- static call
  Op1 (C);  -- dispatching call
  D.Op1;    -- static call (new syntax since Ada 2005)
  C.Op1;    -- dispatching call (new syntax since Ada 2005)

In this fragment, Op1 is not overridden, whereas Op2 is overridden. The body of Op1 calls Op2, thus which Op2 will be called for a call of Op1 with a parameter of type Derived?

The answer is: Ada gives complete control over dispatching and redispatching. If you want redispatching, it has to be required explicitly by converting the parameter to the class-wide type again. (Remember: View conversions never lose components, they just hide them. A conversion to the class-wide type makes them visible again.)

Thus the first call of Op1 (statically linked, i.e. not dispatching) calls the inherited Op1 — and within Op1, the first call to Op2 is therefore also a static call to the inherited Op2 (there is no redispatching). However the second call, since the parameter R is converted to the class-wide type, dispatches to the overriding Op2.

The second call of Op1 is a dispatching call to the inherited Op1 and behaves exactly as the first.
To understand what happens here, the implicitly defined inherited Op1 is just the parent operation called with a view conversion of the parameter:

  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op1 (This: Derived) {{ada/kw|is}}
  {{ada/kw|begin}}
    Op1 (Root (This));  -- view conversion
  {{ada/kw|end}} Op1;

''This is very different from how other OO languages behave.'' In other OO languages, a method is either dispatching or not. In Ada, a routine is either ''available'' for dispatching or not. Whether or not dispatching is actually ''used'' for a given call depends on the way that the object's type is specified at that call point. For programmers accustomed to other OO languages, it can come as quite a surprise that calls from a dispatchable routine to other routines on the same object are, by default, ''not'' dispatched.

Similarly surprising but less commonly encountered, calls from a non-dispatchable routine for a tagged type to other routines on the same object are, by default, ''dispatched'':

  {{ada/kw|type}} Root {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|private}};
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op1 (This: Root'Class);
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op2 (This: Root);
 
  {{ada/kw|type}} Derived {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|new}} Root {{ada/kw|with}} {{ada/kw|private}};
  -- Derived does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; inherit Op1, rather Op1 is applicable to Derived.
  {{ada/kw|overriding}} {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op2 (This: Derived);
 
  {{ada/kw|procedure}} Op1 (This: Root'Class) {{ada/kw|is}}
  {{ada/kw|begin}}
    ...
    Op2 (This);               -- dispatching
    Op2 (Root (This));        -- static call
    This.Op2;                 -- dispatching (new syntax since Ada 2005)
    (Root (This)).Op2;        -- static call (new syntax since Ada 2005)
    ...
  {{ada/kw|end}} Op1;
 
  D: Derived;
  C: Root'Class := D;
 
  Op1 (D);  -- static call
  Op1 (C);  -- static call
  D.Op1;    -- static call (new syntax since Ada 2005)
  C.Op1;    -- static call (new syntax since Ada 2005)

Note that calls on Op1 are always static, since Op1 is ''not'' inherited. Its parameter type is classwide, so the operation is ''applicable'' to all types derived from Root. (Op2 has an entry for each type derived from Root in the dispatch table. There is no such dispatch table for Op1; rather there is only one such operation for all types in the class.)

==== Run-time type identification ====

Run-time type identification allows the program to (indirectly or directly) query the tag of an object at run time to determine which type the object belongs to.
This feature, obviously, makes sense only in the context of polymorphism and dynamic dispatching, so works only on tagged types.

You can determine whether an object belongs to a certain class of types, or to a specific type, by means of the membership test {{Ada/kw|in}}, like this:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Base    {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Base    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Leaf    {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Derived {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 
 ...
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Explicit_Dispatch (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Base'Class) {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    {{Ada/kw|if}} This {{Ada/kw|in}} Leaf {{Ada/kw|then}} ... {{Ada/kw|end if}};
    {{Ada/kw|if}} This {{Ada/kw|in}} Derived'Class {{Ada/kw|then}} ... {{Ada/kw|end if}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Explicit_Dispatch;

Thanks to the strong typing rules of Ada, run-time type identification is in fact rarely needed; the distinction between class-wide and specific types usually allows the programmer to ensure objects are of the appropriate type without resorting to this feature.

Additionally, the reference manual defines &lt;code&gt;package Ada.Tags&lt;/code&gt; (RM 3.9(6/2)), attribute &lt;code&gt;'Tag&lt;/code&gt; (RM 3.9(16,18)), and &lt;code&gt;function Ada.Tags.Generic_Dispatching_Constructor&lt;/code&gt; (RM 3.9(18.2/2)), which enable direct manipulation with tags.

=== Creating Objects ===

The Language Reference Manual's section on
{{Ada/RM|3|3|title=Objects and Named Numbers}} states when an object
is created, and destroyed again. This subsection illustrates
how objects are created.

The LRM section starts,
{{Quote|''Objects are created at run time and contain a value of a given type. An object can be created and initialized as part of elaborating a declaration, evaluating an allocator, aggregate, or function_call''.|}}

For example, assume a typical hierarchy of
object oriented types: a top-level type &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;,
a &lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; type derived from &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;,
and possibly more kinds of persons. Each person has a name; assume &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;
objects to have a &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; component.
Likewise, each &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;Gender&lt;/code&gt; component.
The &lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; type inherits the components and the operations
of the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type, so &lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; objects
have a &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;Gender&lt;/code&gt; component, too.
&lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; objects may have additional components specific
to programmers.

Objects of a tagged type are created the same way 
as objects of any type.
The second LRM sentence says, for example, that an object will be created when you
declare a variable or a constant of a type.
For the tagged type &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;,

 {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
    P{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Person{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
    Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Put_Line{{Ada/delimiter|(}}&quot;The name is &quot; {{Ada/operator|&amp;}} P{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Name{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Nothing special so far. Just like any ordinary variable declaration
this O-O one is elaborated. The result of elaboration is an object named &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;
of type &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;.  However, &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; has only default
name and gender value components. These are likely not useful ones.
One way of giving initial values to the object's components is
to assign an aggregate.

 {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
    P{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Person {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Name {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} &quot;Scorsese&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Gender {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} Male{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
    Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Put_Line{{Ada/delimiter|(}}&quot;The name is &quot; {{Ada/operator|&amp;}} P{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Name{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

The parenthesized expression after := is called an ''aggregate''
({{Ada/RM|4|3|title=Aggregates}}).

Another way to create an object that is mentioned in the LRM
paragraph is to call a function. An object will be created as the
return value of a function call.
Therefore, instead of using an aggregate of initial values,
we might call a function returning an object.

Introducing proper O-O information
hiding, we change the package
containing the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type so that &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;
becomes a private type. To enable clients of the package to construct &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;
objects we declare a function that returns them. (The function may
do some interesting construction work on the objects. For instance, the aggregate above will most probably raise the exception Constraint_Error depending on the name string supplied; the function can mangle the name so that it matches the declaration of the component.) We also declare
a function that returns the name of &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; objects.

 {{Ada/keyword|package}} Persons {{Ada/keyword|is}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Person {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|tagged}} {{Ada/keyword|private}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} Make {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Name{{Ada/delimiter|:}} String{{Ada/delimiter|;}} Sex{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Gender_Type{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} Person{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} Name {{Ada/delimiter|(}}P{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Person{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} String{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|private}}
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Person {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|tagged}}
       {{Ada/keyword|record}}
          Name   {{Ada/delimiter|:}} String {{Ada/delimiter|(}}1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
          Gender {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Gender_Type{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
       {{Ada/keyword|end}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Persons{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Calling the &lt;code&gt;Make&lt;/code&gt; function results in an
object which can be used for initialization.
Since the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; type is '''private''' we can no longer refer to the &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt;
component of &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;.
But there is a corresponding function &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; declared
with type &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; making it a socalled primitive operation.
(The component and the function in this example are both named &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt;
However, we can choose a different name for either
if we want.)

 {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
    P{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Person {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Make {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Name {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} &quot;Orwell&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Sex {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} Male{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
    Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Put_Line{{Ada/delimiter|(}}&quot;The name is &quot; {{Ada/operator|&amp;}} Name{{Ada/delimiter|(}}P{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Objects can be copied into another. The target object is first destroyed.
Then the component values of the source object are assigned to the
corresponding components of the target object. In the following example,
the default initialized &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; gets a copy of one of the objects
created by the &lt;code&gt;Make&lt;/code&gt; calls.

 {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
    P{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Person{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} 2001 {{Ada/op|&gt;}} 1984 {{Ada/keyword|then}}
       P {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Make {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Name {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} &quot;Kubrick&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Sex {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} Male{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|else}}
       P {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Make {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Name {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} &quot;Orwell&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Sex {{Ada/delimiter|1==&gt;}} Male{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|end}} {{Ada/keyword|if}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}} 
 
    Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Put_Line{{Ada/delimiter|(}}&quot;The name is &quot; {{Ada/operator|&amp;}} Name{{Ada/delimiter|(}}P{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}


So far there is no mention of the &lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; type
derived from &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt;.
There is no polymorphism yet, and likewise initialization
does not yet mention inheritance.
Before dealing with &lt;code&gt;Programmer&lt;/code&gt; objects and their initialization
a few words about class-wide types are in order.

=== More details on primitive operations ===

Remember what we said before about [[#Primitive_operations|&quot;Primitive Operations&quot;]].
Primitive operations are:
* subprograms taking a parameter of the tagged type;
* functions returning an object of the tagged type;
* subprograms taking a parameter of an ''anonymous access type'' to the tagged type;
* In Ada 2005 only, functions returning an ''anonymous access type'' to the tagged type;

Additionally, primitive operations must be declared before the type is ''frozen'' (the concept of freezing will be explained later):

Examples:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_1 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_2 (That :    {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_3 (Me   : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_4 (Them : {{Ada/kw|access}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Primitive_5 {{Ada/kw|return}} Object;
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Primitive_6 (Everyone : Boolean) {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Object;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

All of these subprograms are primitive operations.

A primitive operation can also take parameters of the same or other types; also, the controlling operand does not have to be the first parameter:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_1 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Object; Number : {{Ada/kw|in}} Integer);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_2 (You  : {{Ada/kw|in}} Boolean; That : {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_3 (Me, Her : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

The definition of primitive operations specifically excludes named access types and class-wide types as well as operations not defined immediately in the same declarative region. Counter-examples:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Object;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object_Class_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Object'Class;
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Not_Primitive_1 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Object'Class);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Not_Primitive_2 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Object_Access);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Not_Primitive_3 (This :    {{Ada/kw|out}} Object_Class_Access);
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Not_Primitive_4 {{Ada/kw|return}} Object'Class;
  
    {{Ada/kw|package}} Inner {{Ada/kw|is}}
        {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Not_Primitive_5 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|end}} Inner;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

==== Advanced topic: Freezing rules ====

Freezing rules ([[http://www.adaic.com/standards/05rm/html/RM-13-14.html ARM 13.14]]) are perhaps the most complex part of the Ada language definition; this is because the standard tries to describe freezing as unambiguously as possible.
Also, that part of the language definition deals with freezing of all entities, including complicated situations like generics and objects reached by dereferencing access values.
You can, however, get an intuitive understanding of freezing of tagged types if you understand [[#Advanced_topic:_How_dynamic_dispatching_works|how dynamic dispatching works]].
In that section, we saw that the compiler emits a table of primitive operations for each tagged type.
The point in the program text where this happens is the point where the tagged type is ''frozen'', i.e. the point where the table becomes complete.
After the type is frozen, no more primitive operations can be added to it.

This point is the earliest of:
* the end of the package spec where the tagged type is declared
* the appearance of the first type derived from the tagged type

Example:

 {{ada/kw|package}} X {{ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{ada/kw|type}} Object {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|null}} {{ada/kw|record}};
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_1 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
   -- this declaration freezes Object
   {{ada/kw|type}} Derived {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|new}} Object {{ada/kw|with}} {{ada/kw|null}} {{ada/kw|record}};
 
   -- illegal: declared after Object is frozen
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_2 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
 {{ada/kw|end}} X;

Intuitively: at the point where Derived is declared, the compiler starts a new table of primitive operations for the derived type.  This new table, initially, is equal to the table of the primitive operations of the parent type, &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;.  Hence, &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; must freeze.

* the declaration of a variable of the tagged type

Example:

 {{ada/kw|package}} X {{ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{ada/kw|type}} Object {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|null}} {{ada/kw|record}};
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_1 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
   V: Object; -- this declaration freezes Object
 
   -- illegal: declared after Object is frozen
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_2 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
 {{ada/kw|end}} X;

Intuitively: after the declaration of &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;, it is possible to call any of the primitive operations of the type on &lt;code&gt;V&lt;/code&gt;.  Therefore, the list of primitive operations must be known and complete, i.e. frozen.

* The completion (''not'' the declaration, if any) of a constant of the tagged type:

 {{ada/kw|package}} X {{ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{ada/kw|type}} Object {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|null}} {{ada/kw|record}};
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_1 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
   -- this declaration does NOT freeze Object
   Deferred_Constant: {{ada/kw|constant}} Object;
 
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_2 (This : {{ada/kw|in}} Object); -- OK
 
 {{ada/kw|private}}
 
   -- only the completion freezes Object
   Deferred_Constant: {{ada/kw|constant}} Object := ({{ada/kw|null}} {{ada/kw|record}});
 
   -- illegal: declared after Object is frozen
   {{ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_3 (This: {{ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
  {{ada/kw|end}} X;

=== New features of Ada 2005 ===

{{Ada/2005}} 

Ada 2005 adds overriding indicators, allows anonymous access types in more places and offers the object.method notation.

==== Overriding indicators ====

The new keyword {{Ada/keyword|overriding}} can be used to indicate whether an operation overrides an inherited subprogram or not. Its use is optional because of upward-compatibility with Ada 95. For example:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Primitive {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Object; {{Ada/comment|new in Ada 2005}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived_Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Object {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|not overriding}} {{Ada/comment|new optional keywords in Ada 2005}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Derived_Object); {{Ada/comment|new primitive operation}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Primitive {{Ada/kw|return access}} Derived_Object;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

The compiler will check the desired behaviour.

This is a good programming practice because it avoids some nasty bugs like not overriding an inherited subprogram because the programmer spelt the identifier incorrectly, or because a new parameter is added later in the parent type.

It can also be used with abstract operations, with renamings, or when instantiating a generic subprogram:

 {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_X (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Object) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}};
  
 {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
 {{Ada/kw|function}}  Primitive_Y {{Ada/kw|return}} Object {{Ada/kw|renames}} Some_Other_Subprogram;
 
 {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive_Z (This : {{Ada/kw|out}} Object)
       {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Generic_Procedure (Element =&gt; Integer);

==== Object.Method notation ====

We have already seen this notation:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Primitive (This: {{Ada/kw|in}} Object; That: {{ada/kw|in}} Boolean);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

 {{Ada/kw|with}} X;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Main {{Ada/kw|is}}
    Obj : X.Object;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Obj.Primitive (That =&gt; True); {{Ada/comment|Ada 2005 object.method notation}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Main;

This notation is only available for primitive operations where the controlling parameter is the ''first'' parameter.

=== Abstract types ===

A tagged type can also be abstract (and thus can have abstract operations):

 {{Ada/kw|package}} X {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} &amp;hellip;;
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} One_Class_Member      (This : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Another_Class_Member  (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Abstract_Class_Member {{Ada/kw|return}} Object  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} X;

An abstract operation cannot have any body, so derived types are forced to override it (unless those derived types are also abstract). See next section about interfaces for more information about this.

The difference with a non-abstract tagged type is that you cannot declare any variable of this type. However, you can declare an access to it, and use it as a parameter of a class-wide operation.

=== Multiple Inheritance via Interfaces ===

{{Ada/2005|OO}}

Interfaces allow for a limited form of multiple inheritance (taken from Java). On a semantic level they are similar to an &quot;abstract tagged null record&quot; as they may have primitive operations but cannot hold any data and thus these operations cannot have a body, they are either declared {{Ada/kw|abstract}} or {{Ada/kw|null}}. ''Abstract'' means the operation has to be overridden, ''null'' means the default implementation is a null body, i.e. one that does nothing.

An interface is declared with:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Class_Member_1 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Object) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}};
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Class_Member_2 (This :    {{Ada/kw|out}} Object) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|null}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Printable;

You implement an {{Ada/kw|interface}} by adding it to a concrete ''class'':

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Person;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object
                   {{Ada/kw|and}} Printable.Object
    {{Ada/kw|with}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Skilled_In : Language_List;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Class_Member_1   (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} Object);
 
    {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} New_Class_Member (This : Object; That : String);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Programmer;

As usual, all inherited abstract operations must be overridden although ''null subprograms'' ones need not.

Such a type may implement a list of interfaces (called the ''progenitors''), but can have only one ''parent''. The parent may be a concrete type or also an interface.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Parent {{Ada/kw|and}} Progenitor_1 {{Ada/kw|and}} Progenitor_2 ... {{Ada/kw|with}} ...;

=== Multiple Inheritance via Mix-in ===

Ada supports multiple inheritance of ''interfaces'' (see above), but only single inheritance of ''implementation''.  This means that a tagged type can ''implement'' multiple interfaces but can only ''extend'' a single ancestor tagged type.

This can be problematic if you want to add behavior to a type that already extends another type; for example, suppose you have

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Base {{Ada/kw|is tagged private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is new}} Base {{Ada/kw|with private}};

and you want to make &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; controlled, i.e. add the behavior that &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; controls its initialization, assignment and finalization.  Alas you cannot write:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is new}} Base {{Ada/kw|and}} Ada.Finalization.Controlled {{Ada/kw|with private}}; {{Ada/comment|illegal}}

since &lt;code&gt;Ada.Finalization&lt;/code&gt; for historical reasons does not define interfaces &lt;code&gt;Controlled&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Limited_Controlled&lt;/code&gt;, but abstract types.

If your base type is not limited, there is no good solution for this; you have to go back to the root of the class and make it controlled. (The reason will become obvious presently.)

For limited types however, another solutions is the use of a mix-in:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Base {{Ada/kw|is tagged limited private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived;
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Controlled_Mix_In (Enclosing: {{Ada/kw|access}} Derived) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled {{Ada/kw|with null record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In);
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Finalize   (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is new}} Base {{Ada/kw|with record}}
   Mix_In: Controlled_Mix_In (Enclosing =&gt; Derived'Access); {{Ada/comment|special syntax here}}
   {{Ada/comment|other components here...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end record}};

This special kind of mix-in is an object with an access discriminant that references its enclosing object (also known as ''Rosen trick'').  In the declaration of the &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; type, we initialize this discriminant with a special syntax: &lt;code&gt;Derived'Access&lt;/code&gt; really refers to an a access value to the ''current instance'' of type &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt;. Thus the access discriminant allows the mix-in to see its enclosing object and all its components; therefore it can initialize and finalize its enclosing object:

 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Enclosing: Derived {{Ada/kw|renames}} This.Enclosing.{{Ada/kw|all}};
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/comment|initialize Enclosing...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;

and similarly for &lt;code&gt;Finalize&lt;/code&gt;.

The reason why this does not work for non-limited types is the self-referentiality via the discriminant. Imagine you have two variables of such a non-limited type and assign one to the other:

 X := Y;

In an assignment statement, &lt;code&gt;Adjust&lt;/code&gt; is called only ''after'' &lt;code&gt;Finalize&lt;/code&gt; of the target &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; and so cannot provide the new value of the discriminant. Thus &lt;code&gt;X.Mixin_In.Enclosing&lt;/code&gt; will inevitably reference &lt;code&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt;.

Now let's further extend our hierarchy:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Further {{Ada/kw|is new}} Derived {{Ada/kw|with null record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Further);
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Finalize   (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Further);

Oops, this does not work because there are no corresponding procedures for &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt;, yet - so let's quickly add them.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Base {{Ada/kw|is tagged limited private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived;
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Controlled_Mix_In (Enclosing: {{Ada/kw|access}} Derived) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled {{Ada/kw|with null record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In);
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Finalize   (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Derived {{Ada/kw|is new}} Base {{Ada/kw|with record}}
   Mix_In: Controlled_Mix_In (Enclosing =&gt; Derived'Access);  {{Ada/comment|special syntax here}}
   {{Ada/comment|other components here...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|not overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Derived);  {{Ada/comment|sic, they are new}}
 {{Ada/kw|not overriding procedure}} Finalize   (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Derived);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Further {{Ada/kw|is new}} Derived {{Ada/kw|with null record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Further);
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Finalize   (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Further);

We have of course to write &lt;code&gt;not overriding&lt;/code&gt; for the procedures on &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; because there is indeed nothing they could override. The bodies are

 {{Ada/kw|not overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Derived) {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/comment|initialize Derived...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Enclosing: Derived {{Ada/kw|renames}} This.Enclosing.{{Ada/kw|all}};
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   Initialize (Enclosing);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;

To our dismay, we have to learn that &lt;code&gt;Initialize/Finalize&lt;/code&gt; for objects of type &lt;code&gt;Further&lt;/code&gt; will not be called, instead those for the parent &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt;. Why?

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
   X: Further;  -- Initialize (Derived (X)) is called here
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   null;
 {{Ada/kw|end}};  -- Finalize (Derived (X)) is called here

The reason is that the mix-in defines the local object &lt;code&gt;Enclosing&lt;/code&gt; to be of type &lt;code&gt;Derived&lt;/code&gt; in the renames-statement above.
To cure this, we have necessarily to use the dreaded redispatch (shown in different but equivalent notations):

 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Initialize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Enclosing: Derived {{Ada/kw|renames}} This.Enclosing.{{Ada/kw|all}};
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   Initialize (Derived'Class (Enclosing));
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;
 
 {{Ada/kw|overriding procedure}} Finalize (This: {{Ada/kw|in out}} Controlled_Mix_In) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Enclosing: Derived'Class {{Ada/kw|renames}} Derived'Class (This.Enclosing.{{Ada/kw|all}});
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   Enclosing.Finalize;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Finalize;
 
 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
   X: Further;  -- Initialize (X) is called here
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   null;
 {{Ada/kw|end}};  -- Finalize (X) is called here

Alternatively (and presumably better still) is to write

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Controlled_Mix_In (Enclosing: {{Ada/kw|access}} Derived'Class) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Limited_Controlled {{Ada/kw|with null record}};

Then we automatically get redispatch and can omit the type conversions on &lt;code&gt;Enclosing&lt;/code&gt;.

== Class names ==

Both the class package and the class record need a name. In theory they may have the same name, but in practice this leads to nasty &lt;small&gt;(because of unintutive error messages)&lt;/small&gt; name clashes when you use the &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|use}}&lt;/code&gt; clause. So over time three de facto naming standards have been commonly used.

=== Classes/Class ===

The package is named by a plural noun and the record is named by the corresponding singular form.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Persons {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Name   : String (1 .. 10);
          Gender : Gender_Type;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Persons;

This convention is the usually used in Ada's built-in libraries.

Disadvantage: Some &quot;multiples&quot; are tricky to spell, especially for those of us who aren't native English speakers.

=== Class/Object ===

The package is named after the class, the record is just named Object.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Name   : String (1 .. 10);
          Gender : Gender_Type;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Person;

Most [[w:Unified Modeling Language|UML]] and [[w:Interface description language|IDL]] code generators use this technique.

Disadvantage: You can't use the &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|use}}&lt;/code&gt; clause on more than one such class packages at any one time. However you can always use the &quot;type&quot; instead of the package.

=== Class/Class_Type ===

The package is named after the class, the record is postfixed with ''_Type''.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Person_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Name   : String (1 .. 10);
          Gender : Gender_Type;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Person;

Disadvantage: lots of ugly &quot;_Type&quot; postfixes.

== Object-Oriented Ada for C++ programmers ==

In C++, the construct

 class C {
   virtual void v();
   void w();
   static void u();
 };

is strictly equivalent to the following in Ada:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} C {{Ada/kw|is tagged null record}};
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} V (This : {{Ada/kw|in out}} C);        {{Ada/comment|primitive operation, will be inherited upon derivation}}
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} W (This : {{Ada/kw|in out}} C'Class);  {{Ada/comment|not primitive, will not be inherited upon derivation}}
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} U;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

In C++, member functions implicitly take a parameter &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; which is of type &lt;code&gt;C*&lt;/code&gt;.  In Ada, all parameters are explicit.  As a consequence, the fact that &lt;code&gt;u()&lt;/code&gt; does ''not'' take a parameter is implicit in C++ but explicit in Ada.

In C++, &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; is a pointer.  In Ada, the explicit &lt;code&gt;This&lt;/code&gt; parameter does not have to be a pointer; all parameters of a tagged type are implicitly passed by reference anyway.

=== Static dispatching ===

In C++, function calls dispatch statically in the following cases:

* the target of the call is an object type
* the member function is non-virtual

For example:

 C object;
 object.v();
 object.w();

both dispatch statically.  In particular, the static dispatch for v() may be confusing; this is because object is neither a pointer nor a reference. Ada behaves exactly the same in this respect, except that Ada calls this ''static binding'' rather than ''dispatching'':

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
    Object : P.C;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Object.V; {{Ada/comment|statically bound}}
    Object.W; {{Ada/comment|statically bound}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

=== Dynamic dispatching ===

In C++, a function call dispatches dynamically if the two following conditions are met simultaneously:

* the target of the call is a pointer or a reference
* the member function is virtual.

For example:

 C* object;
 object-&gt;v(); // dynamic dispatch
 object-&gt;w(); // static, non-virtual member function
 object-&gt;u(); // illegal: static member function
 C::u(); // static dispatch

In Ada, a primitive subprogram call dispatches (dynamically) if and only if:

* the target object is of a class-wide type;

Note: In Ada vernacular, the term ''dispatching'' always means ''dynamic''.

For example:

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
    Object : P.C'Class := ...;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    P.V (Object); {{Ada/comment|dispatching}}
    P.W (Object); {{Ada/comment|statically bound: not a primitive operation}}
    P.U; {{Ada/comment|statically bound}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

As can be seen ''there is no need for access types or pointers'' to do dispatching in Ada.  In Ada, ''tagged types are always passed by-reference to subprograms'' without the need for explicit access values.

Also note that in C++, the class serves as:

* the unit of encapsulation (Ada uses packages and visibility for this)
* the type, like in Ada.

As a consequence, you call C::u() in C++ because u() is encapsulated in C, but P.U in Ada since U is encapsulated in the ''package'' P, not the ''type'' C.

=== Class-wide and specific types ===

The most confusing part for C++ programmers is the concept of a &quot;class-wide type&quot;.  To help you understand:

* pointers and references in C++ are really, implicitly, class-wide;
* object types in C++ are really specific;
* C++ provides no way to declare the equivalent of:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} C_Specific_Access {{Ada/kw|is access}} C;

* C++ provides no way to declare the equivalent of:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} C_Specific_Access_One {{Ada/kw|is access}} C;
 {{Ada/kw|type}} C_Specific_Access_Two {{Ada/kw|is access}} C;

which, in Ada, are two different, ''incompatible'' types, possibly allocating their memory from different storage pools!

* In Ada, you do ''not'' need access values for dynamic dispatching.
* In Ada, you use access values for dynamic memory management (only) and class-wide types for dynamic dispatching (only).
* In C++, you use pointers and references both for dynamic memory management and for dynamic dispatching.
* In Ada, class-wide types are explicit (with &lt;code&gt;'Class&lt;/code&gt;).
* In C++, class-wide types are implicit (with &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;).

=== Constructors ===

in C++, a special syntax declares a constructor:

 class C {
    C(/* optional parameters */); // constructor
 };

A constructor cannot be virtual.  A class can have as many constructors, differentiated by their parameters, as necessary.

Ada does not have such constructors. Perhaps they were not deemed necessary since in Ada, any function that returns an object of the tagged type can serve as a kind of constructor. This is however not the same as a real constructor like the C++ one; this difference is most striking in cases of derivation trees (see Finalization below). The Ada constructor subprograms do not have to have a special name and there can be as many constructors as necessary; each function can take parameters as appropriate.

 {{ada/kw|package}} P {{ada/kw|is}}
   {{ada/kw|type}} T {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|tagged}} {{ada/kw|private}};
   {{ada/kw|function}} Make                 {{ada/kw|return}} T;  -- constructor
   {{ada/kw|function}} To_T (From: Integer) {{ada/kw|return}} T;  -- another constructor
   -- procedure Make (This: out T);         -- not a constructor
 {{ada/kw|private}}
   ...
 {{ada/kw|end}} P;

If an Ada constructor function is also a primitive operation (as in the example above), it becomes abstract upon derivation and has to be overridden if the derived type is not itself abstract. If you do not want this, declare such functions in a nested scope.

In C++, one idiom is the ''copy constructor'' and its cousin the ''assignment operator'':

 class C {
    C(const C&amp; that); // copies &quot;that&quot; into &quot;this&quot;
    C&amp; operator= (const C&amp; right); // assigns &quot;right&quot; to &quot;this&quot;, which is &quot;left&quot;
 };

This copy constructor is invoked implicitly on initialization, e.g.

 C a = b; // calls the copy constructor
 C c;
 a = c;   // calls the assignment operator

Ada provides a similar functionality by means of ''controlled types''.  A controlled type is one that extends the predefined type &lt;code&gt;Ada.Finalization.Controlled&lt;/code&gt;:

 {{ada/kw|with}} Ada.Finalization;
 {{ada/kw|package}} P {{ada/kw|is}}
   {{ada/kw|type}} T {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Controlled {{ada/kw|with}} {{ada/kw|private}};
   {{ada/kw|function}} Make {{ada/kw|return}} T;  -- constructor
 {{ada/kw|private}}
   {{ada/kw|type}} T {{ada/kw|is}} ... {{ada/kw|end}} {{ada/kw|record}};
   {{ada/kw|overriding}} {{ada/kw|procedure}} Initialize (This: {{ada/kw|in}} {{ada/kw|out}} T);
   {{ada/kw|overriding}} {{ada/kw|procedure}} Adjust     (This: {{ada/kw|in}} {{ada/kw|out}} T); -- copy contructor
 {{ada/kw|end}} P;

Note that Initialize is not a constructor; it resembles the C++ constructor in some way, but is also very different. Suppose you have a type T1 derived from T with an appropriate overriding of Initialize. A real constructor (like the C++ one) would automatically first construct the parent components (T), then the child components. In Ada, this is not automatic. In order to mimic this in Ada, we have to write:

 {{ada/kw|procedure}} Initialize (This: {{ada/kw|in}} {{ada/kw|out}} T1) {{ada/kw|is}}
 {{ada/kw|begin}}
   Initialize (T (This));  -- Don't forget this part!
   ...  -- handle the new components here
 {{ada/kw|end}} Initialize;

The compiler inserts a call to Initialize after each object of type T is allocated when no initial value is given. It also inserts a call to Adjust after each assignment to the object.  Thus, the declarations:

 A: T;
 B: T := X;

will:

* allocate memory for A
* call Initialize (A)
* allocate memory for B
* copy the contents of X to B
* call Adjust (B)

Initialize (B) will not be called because of the explicit initialization.

So, the equivalent of a copy constructor is an overriding of Adjust.

If you would like to provide this functionality to a type that extends another, non-controlled type, see [[#Multiple_Inheritance|&quot;Multiple Inheritance&quot;]].

=== Destructors ===

In C++, a destructor is a member function with only the implicit &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; parameter:

 class C {
    virtual ~C(); // destructor
 }

While a constructor ''cannot'' be virtual, a destructor ''must'' be virtual.  Unfortunately, the rules of the C++ language do not enforce this, so it is quite easy for a programmer to wreak havoc in their programs by simply forgetting the keyword &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt;.

In Ada, the equivalent functionality is again provided by controlled types, by overriding the procedure Finalize:

 {{ada/kw|with}} Ada.Finalization;
 {{ada/kw|package}} P {{ada/kw|is}}
    {{ada/kw|type}} T {{ada/kw|is}} {{ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Controlled {{ada/kw|with}} {{ada/kw|private}};
    {{ada/kw|function}} Make {{ada/kw|return}} T;  -- constructor
 {{ada/kw|private}}
    {{ada/kw|type}} T {{ada/kw|is}} ... {{ada/kw|end}} {{ada/kw|record}};
    {{ada/kw|overriding}} {{ada/kw|procedure}} Finalize (This: {{ada/kw|in}} {{ada/kw|out}} T);  -- destructor
 {{ada/kw|end}} P;

Because Finalize is a primitive operation, it is automatically &quot;virtual&quot;; you cannot, in Ada, forget to make a destructor virtual.

=== Encapsulation: public, private and protected members ===

In C++, the unit of encapsulation is the class; in Ada, the unit of encapsulation is the package.  This has consequences on how an Ada programmer places the various components of an object type.

 class C {
 public:
    int a;
    void public_proc();
 protected:
    int b;
    int protected_func();
 private:
    bool c;
    void private_proc();
 };

A way to mimic this C++ class in Ada is to define a hierarchy of types, where the base type is the public part, which must be abstract so that no stand-alone objects of this base type can be defined. It looks like so:

 {{Ada/kw|private}} {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Finalization;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} CPP {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Public_Part {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|record}}  -- no objects of this type
     A: Integer;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Public_Proc (This: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Public_Part);
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Complete_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Public_Part {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 
   -- procedure Public_Proc (This: in out Complete_Type);  -- inherited, implicitly defined
 
 {{Ada/kw|private}}  -- visible for children
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Part;  -- declaration stub
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Part_Pointer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Private_Part;
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Component {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Finalization.Controlled {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
     P: Private_Part_Pointer;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} record;
 
   {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Initialize (X: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Private_Component);
   {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Adjust     (X: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Private_Component);
   {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Finalize   (X: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Private_Component);
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Complete_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Public_Part {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
     B: Integer;
     P: Private_Component;  -- must be controlled to avoid storage leaks
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
   {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Protected_Proc (This: Complete_Type);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} CPP;

The private part is defined as a stub only, its completion is hidden in the body. In order to make it a component of the complete type, we have to use a pointer since the size of the component is still unknown (the size of a pointer is known to the compiler). With pointers, unfortunately, we incur the danger of memory leaks, so we have to make the private component controlled.

For a little test, this is the body, where the subprogram bodies are provided with identifying prints:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation;
 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} CPP {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Public_Proc (This: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Public_Part) {{Ada/kw|is}}  -- primitive
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Public_Proc&quot; &amp; Integer'Image (This.A));
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Public_Proc;
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Part {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}  -- complete declaration
     C: Boolean;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
   {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Initialize (X: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Private_Component) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     X.P := new Private_Part'(C =&gt; True);
     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Initialize &quot; &amp; Boolean'Image (X.P.C));
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Initialize;
 
   {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure Adjust}} (X: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Private_Component) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Adjust &quot; &amp; Boolean'Image (X.P.C));
     X.P := new Private_Part'(C =&gt; X.P.C);  -- deep copy
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Adjust;
 
   {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Finalize (X: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Private_Component) {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Free {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation (Private_Part, Private_Part_Pointer);
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Finalize &quot; &amp; Boolean'Image (X.P.C));
     Free (X.P);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Finalize;
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Private_Proc (This: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Complete_Type) {{Ada/kw|is}}  -- not primitive
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Private_Proc&quot; &amp; Integer'Image (This.A) &amp; Integer'Image (This.B) &amp; ' ' &amp; Boolean'Image (This.P.P.C));
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Private_Proc;
 
   {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|overriding}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Protected_Proc (This: Complete_Type) {{Ada/kw|is}}  -- primitive
     X: Complete_Type := This;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Protected_Proc&quot; &amp; Integer'Image (This.A) &amp; Integer'Image (This.B));
     Private_Proc (X);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Protected_Proc;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} CPP;

We see that, due to the construction, the private procedure is not a primitive operation.

Let's define a child class so that the protected operation can be reached:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} CPP.Child {{Ada/kw|is}} 
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Do_It (X: Complete_Type);  -- not primitive
  
 {{Ada/kw|end}} CPP.Child;

A child can look inside the private part of the parent and thus can see the protected procedure:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} CPP.Child {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Do_It (X: Complete_Type) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (&quot;Do_It&quot; &amp; Integer'Image (X.A) &amp; Integer'Image (X.B));
     Protected_Proc (X);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Do_It;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} CPP.Child;

This is a simple test program, its output is shown below.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} CPP.Child;
 {{Ada/kw|use}}  CPP.Child, CPP;
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Test_CPP {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   X, Y: Complete_Type;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   X.A := +1;
   Y.A := -1;
 
   Public_Proc (X);  Do_It (X);
   Public_Proc (Y);  Do_It (Y);
 
   X := Y;
 
   Public_Proc (X);  Do_It (X);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Test_CPP;

This is the commented output of the test program:

 Finalize TRUE                            and X

You see that a direct translation of the C++ behaviour into Ada is difficult, if feasible at all. Methinks, the primitive Ada subprograms corresponds more to virtual C++ methods (in the example, they are not). Each language has its own idiosyncrasies which have to be taken into account, so that attempts to directly translate code from one into the other may not be the best approach.

=== De-encapsulation: friends and stream input-output ===

In C++, a friend function or class can see all members of the class it is a friend of.
Friends break encapsulation and are therefore to be discouraged.
In Ada, since packages and not classes are the unit of encapsulation, a &quot;friend&quot; subprogram is simply one that is declared in the same package as the tagged type.

In C++, stream input and output are the particular case where friends are usually necessary:

 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 class C {
 public:
    C();
    friend ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; output, C&amp; arg);
 private:
    int a, b;
    bool c;
 };

 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 int main() {
    C object;
    cout &lt;&lt; object;
    return 0;
 };

Ada does not need this construct because it defines stream input and output operations by default:

 package P is
    pragma Elaborate_Body; -- explained below
    type C is tagged private;
 private
    type C is tagged record
       A, B : Integer;
       C : Boolean;
    end record;
 end P;

 with Ada.Text_IO.Text_Streams;
 with P;
 procedure Main is
    Object : P.C;
 begin
    P.C'Output (Stream =&gt; Ada.Text_IO.Text_Streams.Stream (Ada.Text_IO.Default_Output),
                Item =&gt; Object);
 end Main;

By default, the &lt;code&gt;Output&lt;code&gt; attribute sends the tag of the object to the stream then calls the more basic &lt;code&gt;Write&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which sends the components to the stream in the same order as the declaration, i.e. A, B then C.  It is possible to override the default implementation of the &lt;code&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Output&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Write&lt;/code&gt; attributes like this:

 with Ada.Streams;
 package body P is
    procedure My_Write (Stream : not null access Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type'Class;
                        Item : in C) is
    begin
       -- The default is to write A then B then C; here we change the ordering.
       Boolean'Write (Stream, Item.C);
       Integer'Write (Stream, Item.B);
       Integer'Write (Stream, Item.A);
    end My_Write;
 
    for C'Write use My_Write; -- override the default attribute
 end P;

In the above example, &lt;code&gt;P.C'output&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;P.C'Write&lt;/code&gt; which is overridden in the body of the package.  Since the specification of package &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; does not define any subprograms, it does not normally need a body, so a package body is forbidden.  The &lt;code&gt;pragma Elaborate_Body&lt;/code&gt; tells the compiler that this package does have a body that is needed for other reasons.

Note that the stream IO attributes are not primitive operations of the tagged type; this is also the case in C++ where the friend operators are not, in fact, member functions of the type.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now it is not expected that you'll be able to pronounce Quechua correctly just from reading the last lesson, however as you complete the next lessons it is suggested that you keep going back to the first lesson as a reference. This will hopefully help you internalise the rules.

== Conversation ==
Following is a possible basic conversation in Quechua:

: ''Antuku:'' Yaw! Wawqiy! Mayman richkanki?
: ''Joe:'' Wasiyman richkani.  Qanri?
: ''Antuku:'' Qhatuman richkani. Tupananchiskama!
: ''Joe:'' Ratukama.

Translation:

: ''Antuku:'' Hey! Brother!  Where are (you) going?
: ''Joe:'' (I) am going to my house.  And you?
: ''Antuku:'' (I) am going to the market.  'Till we meet again!
: ''Joe:'' See you later.

== Grammar ==
As you can see in the conversation, the verb form &quot;richka'''nki'''&quot; is for second-person singular and &quot;richka'''ni'''&quot; for first-person.

Here we will give an overview of all persons (yachachiy = to teach)

These are the personal pronouns.

I'm a software engineer who thinks that Wikibooks has a huge potential to do some good in this world.  There are a few thing that I know about that are not in &quot;common&quot; knowledge, and I intend to write some wikibooks to help people out that are trying to learn these subjects.

*[[/New Policies|Here are some opinions]] that I have regarding what some basic policies for Wikibooks ought to be like.
*[[/Sandbox|A little area]] I am using to experiment with various editing styles and minor projects.
*[[/Whole Book|An entire Wikibook at once]]  '''WARNING:''' this Wikibook takes a very long time to load on most browsers.
*[[/Watch List|Watch List]] - This is a list of Wikibooks that need some special attention.
*[[/Bookshelf Reorganization/]] - This is more my vision on how the bookshelves ought to be revised.  Feel free to discuss and rearrange as necessary, but this is only a proposal at the moment.

Because sometimes the stuff I write is quite POV, and perhaps heated, I've started a new blog about the open source textbook movement.  If you are interested in reading some of my opinions, please check it out here:

http://bookcraft.blogspot.com/

As this site is definitely not owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, it would be harder to remove content from this blog by the WMF or its board of trustees.  Still, I intend to mainly concentrate on Wikibooks and general open textbook issues with this forum.  If you want to join the &quot;team&quot; of fellow bloggers to add a post to this blog, please let me know.


Some Wikibooks that I'm currently working on:

*[[Programming:Serial Data Communications]] (something I've started)
*[[Wikijunior Solar System]]
*[[MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook]]
*[[AP Computer Science]]
*[[Wikibooks:State of the Project/2006]]
*[[History of Wikibooks]]
*[[GBA Development]]
*[[Scratch]]
*[[Colors]]

Here are some tools that I find useful:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Over the course of a turtle’s nesting season, a female sea turtle will leave her homing ground and migrate to nesting grounds to build a nest and lay eggs.  One species of turtle, ''Chelonia mydas'', the Green sea turtle, lives off the coasts of [[w:Brazil|Brazil]] but nests each year on the beaches of Ascension Island, a tiny island in the mid-Atlantic Ocean (Papi et al.).  These turtles typically make their way to the island between the months of December and March (Sims).

After migrating to a nesting ground, it is time for the female to choose a nesting site along the beach.  Many factors play into this decision and a female will scope out a site for a few days before she actually decides to build a nest.  However, once the decision of where to nest has been made, females will most likely nest at the same beach and site for the rest of their reproductive years (CCC&amp;STSL).

All species of sea turtles exhibit similar nesting behavior, possibly differing only in inter-nesting period length (the period of time between two nestings during the same nesting season).  On the night of nesting, a sea turtle will emerge from the sea and scope out her surroundings one more time before digging a nest.  If there seems to be any unnatural distractions (i.e. lighting or human presence), a female may return to the sea without building a nest (“false crawl”).  Most often, however, she will proceed to dig a nest on the beach.  To do this, the female turtle first digs a relatively shallow depression, known as a body pit, in the sand using her front flippers and body to push sand out of the way.  Then she will excavate a single egg chamber, a deeper cavity opening to the body pit, into which she will oviposit an entire clutch of eggs during nesting.  Finally, after constructing this egg chamber, she will begin ovipositing her eggs.  It is extremely rare that a sea turtle will stop nesting before laying is complete but will happen if the female senses extreme danger (CCC&amp;STSL).

After laying eggs, the female will camouflage her nest by filling in the body pit with sand and return to the sea only to nest at the same site at a later date in the nesting season.  After nesting a second time, the female sea turtle will return to the sea and migrate back to her homing ground (CCC&amp;STSL).

Many nesting grounds, such as that of the Green sea turtle, are extremely far from the species’ homing ground.  This migration of sea turtles during the nesting season has led to the development of many different hypotheses of ''how'' these adult female turtles continually find the common nesting ground and then how offspring navigate to the homing grounds.  First, it has been suggested that sea turtles may use the earth’s magnetic field to aid in navigation between homing grounds and nesting grounds.  There have, however, been experiments that have weakened this hypothesis in adult sea turtles.  One such experiment involved placing magnets on the back of experimental Green sea turtles in order to disrupt the magnetic field possibly detected by the sea turtles and the courses these turtles followed on the return journey from Ascension Island were tracked.  The results show that, although hatchlings may be able to navigate via earth’s magnetic field, it is very possible that this ability is absent in adults (Papi et al.).  However, another hypothesis has been suggested and states that turtles may use olfactory cues from the ocean currents and winds to navigate through the ocean to nesting grounds (Sims).

==California standards discussion==

Narythegreat,

Do you know what happened to the California standards that were up on the site? We have a bunch of professionals who will donate their work to the page if we use the California standards that were up originally. Can you help me find them and put them back up on the page? The person who started the page originally did so with that set of standards, then went off to get professional volunteers. Now that he has the volunteers, the standards are changed and he is understandable upset. We could maybe make two paralell projects, one using the originally specified California standard and another using the AP standard. What do you think. Can you help me out finding the California standard and getting it back online?

Thanks friend,
--[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 21:16, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)Karl


Narythegreat,

I found the California standards and reinstated them. Please do not be angry with me. I appreciate of course your efforts. I notice that you moved some of the pages from &quot;World History Project&quot; namespaces to &quot;World History&quot; namespaces. What do you think if you develop your contributions in a paralell space that uses the AP standards and uses the namespace of &quot;World History&quot;, and we reserve the &quot;World History Project&quot; namespace for the project that uses the California standards. What do you think of the idea? Assuming you come to be in aggreement ... my time to be on the Internet is very limited; would ou be willing and able to help me divide the work into two? 

Thank you kind person, --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 22:03, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Some quotes from the email they sent me: &quot;We'd been setting up the possibility of having a bunch of World History experts contribute to the California-frameworks-based World History project, gratis. ... I was very disturbed to hear that they had been to the Wiki site and seen the California Standards project that we had discussed replaced by something called the 'AP World History Standard'. These are now deciding to beg off the project!&quot; I hope you can understand where I am coming from on this ... --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 22:10, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)

==California Standards==
Okay, here I go:

1.  I really have to say I'm not a fan of changing back the standards.  The California standard isn't very good.  The AP standard is approved by a much broader range of people.  The use of the California standard is a problem regionally also because newbies will think it's a regional project.  I don't mean to discourage contribution, but the AP standard is used elsewhere, such as in the European and U.S. history projects with success (also I changed the project out of the title for simplicity and I kind of kept the other ones as a kind of guiding hand -- see [[World History]], but honestly, I don't care if the project part is eliminated altogether).  And  furthermore, if there are so many willing contributors, where are they?  You are wasting my time by saying that these experts won't contribute under the AP World History standard (which I made the title up but it is the standard for AP World History) and anyway, ''what kind of &quot;experts&quot; don't know what AP is?  

2.  There have been no edits for almost 4 months by anyone but me.  It is ridiculous to demand that I bow to the demands of people who do not put forth any contribution for so long.  I will not simply start again from scratch.  I kept most the original articles and structure anyway, just changed the standard, and the California one isn't very good.  It's an overly simplistic and western-centered one.

3. I will be very surprised if we go with the California standard and  we see these &quot;expert's&quot; contributions pan out-you of all people must see that people lose focus after a while and abandon projects, like this one's former contributors.  I doubt very highly that you will see anyone doing anything substantial for free after such a reversion. (And also, anyone can just copy and paste their research paper into the project anyway).  I am avidly adding free material, and I welcome help, but what on earth is wrong with the AP standard anyway?  I don't know a soul who after even a casual glance at both would support the California (standard).  Also, since Wikibooks is so limited in its contributors anyway, we need to be accepting of other peoples ideas, and honestly the standards thing amounts to a bunch of bull anyway.  People are going to add what they want and ignore such things in the first place.  Very few of our projects have standards anyway.

4.  As for the parallel namespaces idea, there seems to be little point in such a duplication of effort and I oppose it even if I have to bow to these peoples' (whoever they are, it is not clear to me) wishes.  Also, I did come back and add to this comment, so I hope we don't cause misunderstandings with each other, and I apologize for the sloppy structure.  Yours, kindly--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 03:10, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Also, you'll note that I changed the standards on November 14, and actually it was a week before that, so you'll see that it took over a month for any of these &quot;contributors&quot; to notice the change anyway :(.  I hope you weigh this fact in your opinion of the merit of the statement that these people are just enthusiastically waiting to contribute.  My personal opinion is that it is a lie designed to get you on the side of reverting the standards, but I may be making a big error in judgement.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 03:29, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Narythegreat, of course I understand that you are upset. Please try to overcome your emotion and remain polite, as I am sure that we can come to a conclusion that is convenient to everyone involved. Thankfully the wiki system makes reverts and changes relatively painless ... One of the first people to offer his help to the Wikibooks project is someone who has worked in the textbook industry for almost twenty years and has started his own not-for-profit with the goal of bringing open-content textbooks to the community, beginning in his native California. He in fact aggrees with you that the AP standards are superior, but as the person who originally started the World History Project as a trial is understandably upset to feel that other people have come in and taken over the project and changed the rules that were governing it.

I don't accuse you of breaking any rule, of course you put up notice of the proposed change of standards and gave time for any objectives to be brought forward, and neither he nor I objected at the time. I didn't know what he had in mind and I am living in Mexico right now with limited Internet access and am less active on the site for the moment. 

What I am asking is for your understanding and help to divide the project into two distinct books, one that follows the line that this individual started, and another that follows the direction and the edits that you have contributed.

For the moment I have to act as the representative for this person, who is on the verge of leaving Wikibooks/Wikipedia permanently and advising all of his many high-level contacts of the very negative experience he has had trying to get a textbook together on Wikibooks. This would be a big blow to Wikibooks and I believe to open source textbooks in general. 

All he wants is a place for his team of paid, professional textbook-writing history experts to continue the stub of a book that was begun on the World History Project page time back. At the moment these people were so enraged at the abandonment of the original standard that they refuse to continue with the project. I hope to negotiate with them to convince them to continue.

Narythegreat, I need your help. You have the power in your hands to help make this project and the whole site a greater success that will be used in actual classrooms, or to make things more difficult and set the whole site back. You of course are free to choose your course of action. And helping me does not mean that any of your changes have to be lost, because my plan is to make two books, one for each standard.

Please let me know what you think.
Karl

===California vs AP standard===
Having taken both AP and regular California history classes, AP standards cover considerably more than what is required by the California standard.  For that reason, I support the AP standard.  I, however, don't understand how can both standards not overlap at least 75% of the way.  If there some parts that do not overlap, we should try to meet both standards.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 03:43, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== a bit lost ==

Hi, My name is James and I'm registered as totalthinker on normal wikipedia. I think this project is really exciting and would like to take part, time permitting. However, I would like to add a few constructive comments;

1. I'm British and have never heard of Californias or AP's; if this site is for lots of people worldwide then this terminology is a bit restrictive and confusing, although I whink using such a course as a foundation guide is a good idea. Just don't include these names as foundational, or if you do then rename the course; &quot;World History AP guide&quot;.

2. The contents summary is a bit cluttered and vague at points, for example combining medieval european and middle eastern cultures etc.

3. A very good site is HyperHistory which has a good but quite partisan history of the world; could provide some guidance.

4. The best overall intro to all this I have read was w.h. Mvneill's &quot;The rise of the West&quot;. Don't be put off by the title! This book is simply excellent. I think it should be our guide/model.

Thanks, hope it helps.

James

--[[User:Firebird000|Firebird000]] 03:25, 26 August 2005 (UTC)== Helping with World History book ==

Hi.  I just wanted to say that I'm glad you helped save the world history book.  It's definetly something I'd like to help with.  I'm not a history fanatic so I can't write essays on it, but I'd definetly would like to help with content and some graphics work. Definetly worth it.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 10:07, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Sure I'm helping.  Just point me in a direction right now.  I'm sure I can do that great a job right now, as I am busy with some other projects, but I should still be able to make a contribution.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 10:16, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I'll be proofreading mostly and I'll see what I can contribute.--[[User:Alsocal|Alsocal]] 01:17, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I'll help out a bit.  I'm a world history buff, so I'm good with most things.  I wrote the Middle Eastern empires section (as of now, at least) so I did that.  I have pretty good all-around knowledge.  I could be an essayist or something, as well as continue working on chapters and what-not.--[[User:Constantijn|Constantijn]] 16:14, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Hi. I'm a former AP World History student myself, and I took the AP exam. I'd be happy to help write for the textbook. I already added an appendix on preping for the exam.
--[[User:Firebird000|Firebird000]] 03:25, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

== Nice job, and a suggestion ==

Hi there Naryathegreat. Great job you've done so far. It's a crying shame that this sort of project hasn't exploded, as it rightly should. If I could just make a couple of point

1. I would like to second the opinion offered above - I have never heard of either 'standard' or whatever pedants wish to call them. These 'professionals' clearly do not understand the meaning of Wikibooks as an open system, with communally decided standards etc. I would recommend a fairly loose system based around a constantly evolving and perfecting set of rules, as users discover errors, potential bias or faults and suchlike. I see the current set of standards as fairly good overall. If the individuals commented on above are so unbending, they are unlikely to be suited to the discussive method of editing that goes on around here!

2. This is ONLY a suggestion. Have you considered contacting individuals from Wikipedia who have written authoratative articles on topics such as History/World history/Ancient history/Modern history and so on? This could provide a method of crossover and crosslinking the two sites, and utilising the resources of both. Currently Wikibooks (mostly) is not sufficiently authoritative and peer-reviewed to be useful to Wikipedia, but the opposite could certainly provide the explosive growth you say you need and expect! If I were an historian, I would be very willing to commit myself to this project.

3. When the Project becomes large enough, it may be necessary to define certain areas necessary for various syllabii. Why not create a system of markers that can be added to the content, or even colour coding. If this book does start to grow rapidly, individuals will doubtless add content entirely surplus to the requirements of whichever standard is predominant.

== C++ Top Note ==

Oi Naryathegreat, just to explain you why I reverted your change on Prog.:C++

Sorry about it, but I do think that the box is really not needed as there is no real need to call attention to the wikibooks limitations :).
The name of the page it is not yet set into stone, (that is why I used the spaces in the name) as you may know this is a fork from a prev. book also on wikibooks so the original name was taken and there shouldn´t be 2 books on the same subject so untill I solve the problem (by restructuring the work, merge etc... there is no solution for it).

{{wrongtitle|title=Programming:C++ (2)}}

Can you make a humm template, macro (cant remember the wiki name, or show me how, links
etc...) with no box and a merge of the structure of what you did and I
used so there is no loss of information (like that the limitation is due
to Wikibooks, that will provide more info if the work is accessed outside of the wikiworld, without the use of the box the size of the line doesn't
have so much importance, just the information provided by the notice),
txs

{{:Programming:_C_-/-_-/-_TopNote}}

PS: If you did not agree with my opinion, please move this post to the Talk section of the book, so we will debate and try to get more input on it, txs again

PPS: Herrr, rembered that I could look up what you did, so now I can TEMPLATE also :), I didn't change it (the template) before talking to you, did you use it on more books (that can be a problem, we can end up with lots of templates in place of local rewrites of the same wording) ?

Hello Narya!

I have been perusing your wikibook for the last few weeks and have noticed that you are in need of assistance.  I am a California Public High School Student enrolled in AP World and AP US History over two years and have recieved a 5 on both exams.  I also tutor other students in both subjects.  I was wondering if I could have the opportunity to join your staff as I love to contribute to others' understanding of this fabulous subject.  Thank you!

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Naryathegreat. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Naryathegreat~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

If you press F5 again, another line of text saying &quot;Hello World&quot; will appear on the upper left hand side of the screen pushing the first one down to the second row of the screen.  You can follow the same procedure for the rest of the example programs in this wikibook.  

==1HELLO.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 PRINT &quot;Hello World&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==PRINT==
PRINT is QBasic's text output function. It is the command that we will be exploring through this section. PRINT is a QBasic function that requires arguments. The argument in the Hello World program we just ran were the words &quot;Hello World&quot;.  So, PRINT is the function and &quot;Hello World&quot; is the argument we ''pass-to'' the function.  

PRINT [Text to screen]

''*note, for a short cut, just use a question mark &quot;?&quot; in place of the command &quot;PRINT&quot;. Likewise you can use a single quote &quot; ' &quot; in place of the key word REM to insert comments in your code''

==2HELLO.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 PRINT &quot;This line will be erased&quot;
 CLS
 PRINT &quot;Hello&quot;;
 PRINT &quot; World&quot;,
 PRINT &quot;Hello Jupiter&quot;
 PRINT &quot;Good Bye&quot;,,&quot;For&quot;;&quot; Now&quot;
 PRINT 1,2,3,4,5
&lt;/source&gt;

==PRINT, Commas, Semicolons and CLS==
This is what the program output should look like:
&lt;source lang=text&gt;
Hello World   Hello Jupiter
Good Bye                    For Now
 1             2             3              4              5
&lt;/source&gt;
The first line of 2HELLO.BAS outputs &quot;This line will be erased.&quot; to the screen. However, in the second line, the CLS command clears the screen immediately after. So, it will only flash momentarily. The text &quot;Hello Jupiter&quot; should line up with '2' under it. More than one comma can be used consecutively. In this example, after &quot;Good Bye&quot; two commas are used to move &quot;For Now&quot; over two tab columns. &quot;For Now&quot; should line up with '3'.

My final statement on this topic is to play around with it. Try using commas and semicolons in a program.

==3HELLO.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 hello$ = &quot;Hello World&quot;
 number = 12
 PRINT hello$, number
&lt;/source&gt;

==Variables==
Variables are used to store information. They are like containers. You can put information in them and later change the information to something else. In this first example they may not seem very useful but in the next section (Input) they will become very useful.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
In this example we use two types of variables - string variables and numeric variables. A string variable holds words, a string of characters (a character is a number, letter or symbol). In this case the characters are letters. A string variable is denoted by ending the name of the variable with a dollar sign. The string variable in this program is hello$. What ever you set hello$ equal to will be displayed in the PRINT statement. The numeric variable is number. Numeric variables do not have a special ending like string variables.
&lt;br&gt;

==4FACE.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 LOCATE 14, 34     'position the left eye
 PRINT &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;       'draw the left eye
 LOCATE 14, 43     'position the right eye
 PRINT &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;       'draw the right eye
 LOCATE 16, 39     'position the nose
 PRINT &quot;o|o&quot;       'draw the nose
 LOCATE 18, 36     'position the mouth
 PRINT &quot;\_______/&quot; 'draw the mouth
 LOCATE 19, 42     'the bottom
 PRINT &quot;The Face by QBasic&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==LOCATE statement==
LOCATE allows you to position the cursor for the next piece of text output. Contrary to Cartesian coordinates which read (X,Y), the locate statement is LOCATE Y,X. In this case Y is the distance down from the top of the screen and X is the distance from the left side of the screen. The reason that LOCATE does not follow the standard coordinate system is that it is not necessary to include the X portion, you can use the format LOCATE Y which just specifies the line to start on.

LOCATE[row,column]&lt;br /&gt;
LOCATE[row]

==5FACE.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS

 LOCATE 14, 34
 COLOR 9
 PRINT &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;

 LOCATE 14, 43
 PRINT &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;

 COLOR 11
 LOCATE 16, 39
 PRINT &quot;o|o&quot;

 COLOR 4
 LOCATE 18, 36
 PRINT &quot;\_______/&quot;

 COLOR 20
 LOCATE 19, 42
 PRINT &quot;U&quot;

 LOCATE 1, 1
 COLOR 16, 1
 PRINT &quot;Hello World&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==COLOR statement==
The program 5FACE.BAS is broken into sections to make it easier to read. This is an example of a good programming habit. Each three line piece of code each piece of code specifies what color it's part of the face should be, where it should be and what it should look like. The order of the position and the color is unimportant. The new statement COLOR allows you to change the color of the text. Once changed, all output will be in the new color until COLOR or CLS is used. &lt;br&gt;

COLOR [foreground]&lt;br /&gt;
COLOR [foreground],[background]&lt;br&gt;

The colors are designated by numbers which will be discussed in the next section.

==Color by Number==
There are 16 colors (in screen mode 0), numbered from 0 to 15.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|0  || Black              ||8  || Dark  Grey (Light Black)
|-
|1  || Blue               ||9  || Light Blue
|-
|2  || Green              ||10 || Light Green
|-
|3  || Cyan               ||11 || Light Cyan
|-
|4  || Red                ||12 || Light Red
|-
|5  || Purple             ||13 || Light Purple
|-
|6  || Brown/Orange       ||14 || Yellow   (Light Orange)
|-
|7  || Light Grey (White) ||15 || White    (Light White)  
|}

If you look carefully at this chart you can see that there are 8 main colors (0 through 7) and then those colors repeat, each in a lighter shade.  You may also notice that the colors act as a combination of binary values (where blue=1, green=2, red=4, etc.)  This makes it much easier to memorize the color scheme. Blinking colors are also available: at 16, the colors start over again with blinking black and extend through 31 (blinking white). However, the blinking option is not available for the background, only for the text (foreground).

It is possible to switch the blinking foreground text with an intense background, but this task is beyond the scope of this QBasic textbook, and may not work when MS Windows displays the console in a windowed mode.

==Summary==
In this section we looked at several methods to manipulate text output. All centered around the PRINT statement. LOCATE and COLOR modified where the text was displayed and how it looked. We used CLS to clear the screen and gave a brief introduction to variables which will be expanded upon in later sections.

So, you've read the tutorials on how to model, or you've used Blender before... Cool. Now what?
You've created a nice model, you know how to animate it, but you want your textures in a way that Blender won't let you use by default.

Well, don't despair. Blender's not out of resources for you just yet.

I'll take a simple model, and I'll assume you know how to set the camera, render settings to default and add an object.

I'm going to create a simple representation of our planet Earth. Images for that can be found on the web, and there's a finished blender file ready linked at the bottom of this tutorial which has the textures packed in it.

First you get rid of the cube from the default scene. Keep the light and the camera as is. 
Next add a sphere, go back to object mode and add an empty from the add menu (screenshot below).

[[Image:Add_empty.jpg]]

Once you added it, you want to add a material to the sphere. Look at another page on how to do that. Once you have the material added, add a texture to the material. Once added, select the type, image.

[[Image:Select_image.jpg]]

Load the image (in this case the image is packed within the example blender file) as the texture. Use whatever options you want for the image to appear correct in the preview window.

Once the texture applies to the material, go back to the materials tab (red sphere).
There, look for the Map Input tab, and open it.
Select Object, and enter the name of the empty object. In this case it will be &quot;Empty&quot; (it is case sensitive, so watch out).

[[Image:Object_input.jpg]]

Now try and animate a rotation on the empty, say 360 degrees in 360 frames. (See another tutorial to learn how to do that). Don't move the sphere, and render the animation.

TADA! The earth seems to rotate, but the object doesn't...
Now parent the empty to the sphere, so that when you grab the sphere you don't forget to move the empty accordingly. (alt-p after selecting first the empty then the sphere).
You can now create really cool animations, where the earth rotates around the sun and on itself, but you only need to worry about the revolution of the earth, not its own rotation.
I haven't done that part of the animation, but give it a try, and admire your skills at making earth go round around the sun... Or not!

All materials in this tutorial are just applied to a simple sphere in order to easily show the effect the textures have and don't have to worry about how the textures are applied for the most part. For a more complex object you will likely have to worry about uv mapping which is not covered in this tutorial. For more information on uv mapping look at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/UV Map Basics|UV Map Basics]]
	
To start select the sphere and bring up the materials panel 
(can be found by pressing F5 or the icon in the button bar).
It should look like this

[[Image:Blender3D_materials_and_textures_panel_button.png]]
[[Image:Blender3D_materials_panel_button.png]]
[[Image:mat-screen.png]]
	
Hit ''Add New'' to add a new material that will be associated with that object.  Once you are looking at the material you will notice under the ''Texture'' panel eight blank buttons. These are your texture slots. This means you can have 8 textures mapped to vary properties of your material. From Blender 2.36, you can use 10 slots. These slots are processed in sequence. Which means that if you have a texture that will be computed (for example, an environment map), and you have several texture slots used, you should put the computed slot at the end. A texture describes a design, either an image or one of blender's various different texture types.
	
[[Image:mat-tex-slots.png]]
	
First thing is to add a texture to the material.  Do this by selecting one of the blank texture slots and hit ''Add New'' button just to the right. The material now has a texture associated with it, you now have to describe that texture. Do this by selecting 
the brown brick like button on the header or by pressing F6. You will see the same texture slot list with the texture you have already added. From here you can change the various texture types. Basically just play with the various options and you can see the results for something you like. I am not going to cover how each one looks, its easy to figure out via experimentation by changing texture and modifying its parameters and watching the preview. You can apply images (from files) using the images texture type. Most serious 3D modelers have a large collection of textures.  
	
Now I will talk about what you can apply textures for. Go back to the material buttons (F5). Then bring up the ''Map To'' panel. Here is a screen shot of what you should be seeing.

[[Image:mat-tex-slots2.jpg]]
	
The top row of buttons you see there tells how the texture will be applied to the material. Multiple texture slots can be applied to the same attribute, and the same texture can apply to multiple attributes. Any buttons that are pressed down the texture will be applied to. Some buttons have two down states. For these buttons the second down state represents the inverse (if this doesn't make much sense don't worry examples will make it more clear). Its important to understand that when you're modifying the textures themselves in the texture buttons (F6) the preview will always show color. Just because it shows that way in the preview doesn't mean it will show that way when finally applied in the material.  It will depend on what you map that texture to and how it interacts with the other textures already on the material.
	
I am now going to describe some of the more common attributes you can map textures to as well as give some examples. To start this is the settings for the texture that I will be using if you want to follow along. To get this all I did was change ''Texture Type'' to DistortedNoise.  Everything else is at defaults.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:texture-setup.jpg]] --&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;th&gt;Button Label&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Images&lt;/th&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Col&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
		Color, this is the color of the object. The Col slider effects how much the texture will merge
		into the material.  Think of it as the transparency of the texture 0 is transparent 
		(no affect for the texture),
		1 is fully opaque (the texture totally overrides underlying color).	
		&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;[[Image:mapto-color.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Nor&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
		Normal Map.  This can be thought of as bumpiness.  The simplest way to conceptualize this is to
		think of white areas as dented in and black as dented out.  This is a simplification of what is really
		happening but is usually the way you want to think of this.  This differs from displacement in that the
		bumps are quicker but less accurate, especially when viewed at shallow angles.  The Nor slider effects
		how much the texture makes the material bumpy.  Higher values are more bumpy.  If you're not seeing bumps
		make sure it is not set to 0.
		&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;[[Image:mapto-normal.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;RayMir&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
		Ray Mirror.  This describes what areas are reflective and which areas are not.  White for areas that are
		reflective, black for areas with no reflection.  The ''Var'' slider will affect how much the texture affects
		reflections (0 for little, 1 for totally).  Some important things to note for this to work. You
		must have Ray checked in the display buttons (F10).  Also you should have ''Ray Mirror'' checked
		for the material.  As a final note the value for the RayMirror slider should stay at 0 or it alters your results.
		&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;[[Image:mapto-raymirror.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;tr&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;Disp&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;
		Displacement.  This is similar to Nor but gives more accurate results at the cost of speed.  The other
		issue with displacement is that because it modifies actual geometry when creating bumps the object
		must be of a suitably high mesh resolution for this to work correctly.  Basically it moves the actual vertices
		around.  So if there is not enough vertices it looks very jagged.  To make it look reasonable you usually have to subdivide
		several times.  The &lt;i&gt;Disp&lt;/i&gt; slider affects how much displacement is applied.  If you're not 
		seeing any bumps make sure it is not set to 0.
		&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;td&gt;[[Image:mapto-disp.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;/tr&gt;	
	&lt;/table&gt;

Do we all go through a metamorphosis?
&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;
I believe that we are constantly metamorphosing as individuals as well as a society.  Our success as a culture is dependent on change.  One might argue that change and metamorphosis are completely different ideas.  I do not see them as such, but merely as different levels of the same thing.  [[wikt:Change|Change]] is defined by [[Wiktionary]] as &quot;the process of becoming different.&quot;  Metamorphosis is defined by The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition as &quot;A marked change in appearance, character, condition, or function.&quot;

==Light verbs==
Most verbs in Persian are light verbs.  There are relatively few simple verbs still in use.

* {{term-fa|یاد گرفتن|yâd gereftan|to learn}}
* {{term-fa|کار داشتن|kâr dâštan|to be busy}} (“to have work”), e.g. {{Persian/text|کار دارم|kâr dâram|I’m busy.}}
* {{term-fa|کار کردن|kâr kardan|to do work}}
* {{term-fa|پیدا شدن|peydâ šodan|to become found}}
* {{term-fa|گوش دادن|guš dâdan|to give ear (listen)}}
* {{term-fa|خوب بودن|xub budan|to be good}}

Some light verbs are active vs. passive in pairs with کردن vs. شدن (e.g. تلفن کردن, تمیر کردن, گریه کردن, فراموش کردن, فکر کردن)

* {{Persian/text|کلیدم را گم کردم.|kelidamow gom kardam|I lost my key.}}
* {{Persian/text|کلیدم گم شد.|kelidam gom šod|My key was lost.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wheeled robots are robots that navigate around the ground using motorized wheels to propel themselves. This design is simpler than using treads or legs and by using wheels they are easier to design, build, and program for movement in flat, not-so-rugged terrain.  They are also more well controlled than other types of robots.  Disadvantages of wheeled robots are that they can not navigate well over obstacles, such as rocky terrain, sharp declines, or areas with low friction.  Wheeled robots are most popular among the consumer market, their differential steering provides low cost and simplicity.  Robots can have any number of wheels, but three wheels are sufficient for static and dynamic balance.  Additional wheels can add to balance; however, additional mechanisms will be required to keep all the wheels in the ground, when the terrain is not flat.

=== Navigation ===
Most wheeled robots use differential steering, which uses separately driven wheels for movement.  They can change direction by rotating each wheel at a different speed.  There may be additional wheels that are not driven by a motor these extra wheels help keep it balanced.

=== 2-wheeled robots ===
Two wheeled robots are harder to balance than other types because they must keeping moving to maintain upright. The center of gravity of the robot body is kept below the axle, usually this is accomplished by mounting the batteries below the body. They can have their wheels parallel to each other, these vehicles are called dicycles, or one wheel in front of the other, tandemly placed wheels. Two wheeled robots must keep moving to remain upright and they can do this by driving in the direction the robot is falling. To balance, the base of the robot must stay with under its center of gravity.  For a robot that has the left and right wheels, it needs at least two sensors. A tilt sensor that is used to determine tilt angle and wheel encoders which keep track of the position of the platform of the robot.  

[[File:Swing-type robot.png|center|thumb|288px|Swing-type robot]] 

==== Examples ====
===== Roomba =====
Roombas are two-wheeled vacuum cleaners that automatically moves around cleaning up a room.  They utilizes a contact sensor in the front and a infrared sensor on its top.

[[File:Roomba_original.jpg|center|thumb|288px|Roomba]] 

===== Segway =====
[http://www.segway.com/ Segways] are self-balancing dicycle electric vehicles.

 

===== Ghost Rider =====
[http://www.ghostriderrobot.com/ Ghost Rider] was the only two wheeled robot entered for the [http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge05/ Darpa Grand 2005 Challenge].  It was unique because of its motorcycle design, unlike the other two-wheeled robots, the wheel alignment is front and back, which makes it harder to balance as it turns.  This tandem design of the wheels is much less common than that of a dicycle.

=== 3-wheeled vehicles ===
3-wheeled robots may be of two types: differentially steered (2 powered wheels with an additional free rotating wheel to keep the body in balance) or 2 wheels powered by a single source and a powered steering for the third wheel. In the case of differentially steered wheels, the robot direction may be changed by varying the relative rate of rotation of the two separately driven wheels. If both the wheels are driven in the same direction and speed, the robot will go straight. Otherwise, depending on the speed of rotation and its direction, the center of rotation may fall anywhere in the line joining the two wheels. 
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Tanklike.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;Differentially steered 3 wheeled vehicle&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

The center of gravity in this type of robot has to lay inside the triangle formed by the wheels. If too heavy of a mass is mounted to the side of the free rotating wheel, the robot will tip over.

=== Omni Wheels ===
Another option for wheeled robots that makes it easier for robots with wheels not all mounted on the same axis to have Omni Wheels.  An omni wheel is like many smaller wheels making up a large one, the smaller ones have axis perpendicular to the axis of the core wheel.  This allows the wheels to move in two directions, and the ability to move holonomically, which means it can instantaneously move in any direction.  Unlike a car, which moves non-holnomicallly and has to be in motion to change heading. Omni-wheeled robots can move in at any angle in any direction, without rotating beforehand.  	 
Some omni wheel robots use a triangular platform, with the three wheels spaced at 60 degree angles.  Advantages of using 3 wheels and not 4 are that its cheaper, and 3 points are guaranteed to be on the same plane, so each wheel in contact with the ground, but only one wheel will be rotating in the direction of travel.  The disadvantages of using Omni wheels is that they have poor efficiency due to not all the wheels rotating in the direction of movement, which also causes loss from friction, and are more computationally complex because of the angle calculations of movement. 

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Omniwheel.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;A simple omni wheel. The free rotating rollers (dark gray) allow the wheel to slide laterally.&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;


=== 4-wheeled vehicles ===

==== 2 powered, 2 free rotating wheels ====
Same as the Differentially steered ones above but with 2 free rotating wheels for extra balance.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:4wheel 2free.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;2 powered, 2 free rotating wheels&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

More stable than the three wheel version since the center of gravity has to remain inside the rectangle formed by the four wheels instead of a triangle. This leaves a larger useful space. Still it's advisable to keep the center of gravity to the middle of the rectangle as this is the most stable configuration, especially when taking sharp turns or moving over a non-level surface.

==== 2-by-2 powered wheels for tank-like movement ====
[[File:ActivMedia Pioneer 3-AT robot.jpg|thumb|The Pioneer 3-AT robot has four motors and four unsteered wheels; on each side a pair of motors drives a pair of wheels through a single belt.]]
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:4wheel 4drive.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;4 wheel drive&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

This kind of robot uses 2 pairs of powered wheels. Each pair (connected by a line) turn in the same direction. The tricky part of this kind of propulsion is getting all the wheels to turn with the same speed. If the wheels in a pair aren't running with the same speed, the slower one will slip (inefficient). If the pairs don't run at the same speed the robot won't be able to drive straight. A good design will have to incorporate some form of car-like steering.

==== Car-like steering ====
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Differential drive.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;Differential Steering&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

This method allows the robot to turn in the same way a car does. This is a far harder method to build and makes dead reckoning much harder as well. This system does have an advantage over previous methods when your robot is powered by a combustion engine: It only needs one motor (and a servo for steering of course). The previous methods would require either 2 motors or a very complicated gearbox, since they require 2 output axles with independent speed and direction of rotation.

==== Examples ====
The [http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/index.asp DARPA Grand and Urban Challenges] pit robotic cars against one another in a series of navigational tests.  These robots are fully automated and drive themselves along the test course.  The DOD sponsors the competition and it is used to facilitate robotic development.

&lt;center&gt;
 
&lt;/center&gt;

=== 5 or more wheeled vehicles ===
For larger robots. Not always very practical.&lt;BR&gt;
Especially when more powered wheels are used the design becomes much more complex as each of the wheels have to turn with the same speed when the robot has to move forwards. Differences in speed between the left and right wheels in differentially steered robots cause the robot to move to the side instead of in a straight line. Difference in speed between wheel on the same side cause slipping of the slowest wheel.

Sometimes an extra free rotating wheel with odometry is added to the robot.  This measures more accurately how the robot moves. Odometry on the powered wheels excludes slip and other movements and thus could be erroneous.

==== Examples ====
[http://marsrover.nasa.gov/home/index.html The Mars Rovers] (Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity) are six wheeled robots that navigate across Martian terrain after landing.  They are used to examine territory, interesting landmarks and make observations about the surface of Mars.  They have a suspension system which keeps all six wheels in contact with the surface, and helps them traverse slopes ans sandy terrain.
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Pathfinder01.jpg|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;The Sojourner Rover&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:NASA_Mars_Rover.jpg|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;Artist's Concept of Rover on Mars&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

=== One Wheel ===
One wheeled robots are extremely difficult to keep balanced due to the single point of contact with the ground.  There have been experimental designs and robots that do only have one wheel.  It is easier to use a spherical wheel rather than a typical disc wheel, as the robot can move in any direction along the sphere.
[http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/experiments/rosie/rosie-sketch.html An example sketch] shows the basic idea of using gyroscopes and counter-torque mechanisms to keep the robot upright.  The spinning flywheels stabilize and tilt it, allowing for non-holonomic movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">“In the early days of air travel, detractors used to argue that, if God had meant us to fly, he would have given us wings.  Had he meant us to roll, he might also have given us wheels – but instead we, along with the great preponderance of land animals great and small, have wound up traveling on legs.”{{ref|McGeer92}}

=== Legs v. Wheels ===

Most man-made vehicles today travel on wheels and for good reason: wheels are much easier to construct and control.  In today’s economy, they also tend to be much cheaper than their legged counterparts.  However legs have distinct advantages over wheels.  The biggest advantage is in transversability and efficiency.  Legged robots have a unique ability to:

* Isolate their body from terrain irregularities 
* Avoid undesirable footholds 
* Regulate their stability 
* Achieve energy efficiency{{ref|Gait}}

These advantages are very desirable in modern robotics, and therefore a lot of research is being put into creating robots that can walk.  The most challenging task in designing a legged robot is to create a system that can generate the proper gait. {{ref|Gait}}

=== Dynamic v. Static ===

Locomotion techniques can be divided into two main categories: static and dynamic.

Robots that use static movement are always balanced; that is, their center of gravity is always within their ground contact base.  While this technique has been successfully used to create many robots (included wheeled ones), it is more akin to wheeled movement than true dynamic walking and as such retains fewer of the advantages.  While more adept at transversing uneven terrain than most wheeled robots, robots that use static walking are very inefficient as power is put into every movement.  However, robots that use static walking are much easier to control than their dynamic counterparts and thus often more viable.

Dynamic walking is characterized in that the robot is not always in balance.  Many robots that use dynamic walking are continually “falling” and thus much more energy efficient.  Dynamic walking requires much more complex control systems in order to not fall.  Robots utilizing dynamic walking cannot use the same motions at different speeds to attain different speeds of movement, but must use entirely different motions at different speeds.  However, dynamic walking can achieve many more advantages over wheeled locomotion.  Dynamic walking is found very abundantly in nature.

A subset of dynamic walking is called passive dynamic movement.  Most dynamic walking systems use active control to move the legs to the correct orientations for walking (hence active dynamic walking).  Passive dynamic walking is characterized by a system where “gravity and inertia alone generate the locomotion pattern.” {{ref|McGeer90}} Passive dynamic movement can be achieved with maximum efficiency, as the vehicle uses its own forward momentum to propagate its next movement.  Very little energy is lost from the system.  Most of the concepts of passive dynamic walking and research conducted in the field was done by aeronautical engineer Tad McGeer between 1988 and 1992.{{ref||HistToys}}

=== More Than Four ===

Many different walking robots have been developed that use six or more legs.  This is due to the fact that a robot using this many legs can be controlled with static walking techniques rather than dynamic walking.  Most of the walking techniques can be demonstrated sufficiently using the six legged model:

# Six legged robot in neutral position
# Alternating legs move forward on either side
# All other legs move forward
# Body follows legs forward

Most robots using six or more legs use a variation of one of these two gait models.

=== Four Legs ===

A system on four legs is another walking scheme found readily in nature.  Four legged robots have the advantage of being statically stable when not moving, but require dynamic walking control.  There are many different ways for a four legged robot to walk including alternating pairs and opposite pairs as in six legged robots.  However these techniques now cease to be statically stable and thus require dynamic control. 

Boston Dynamics has developed a four legged robot for DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) called “Big Dog,” that they claim is “the most advanced quadruped robot on earth.”{{ref|BigDog}} Big Dog can run at four miles per hour, climb thirty five degree slopes, and carry 340 pounds.  But the most impressive feature is its dynamic walking: Big Dog can recover from slipping and even being pushed.  Its behavior is such that it approaches the infamous “uncanny valley” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley).  The Boston Dynamics website (http://bostondynamics.com/content/sec.php?section=BigDog) features a video demonstration of Big Dog’s abilities.  

=== Three Legs ===

Three legged robots are not very common, especially since they have no biological counterparts.  However, researchers at Virginia Tech’s RoMeLa lab have developed a three legged robot STriDER that uses a “revolutionary” passive dynamic walking technique.  STriDER is short for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.  STriDER sways until it can lift one leg, and using the other two as an A-frame, swing it in between the other two “stance” legs moving forward at a sixty degree angle. This patent pending “tripedal gait” is extremely energy efficient and requires minimal control.  It also allows STriDER to easily change directions by changing the sequence of its steps.  A video posted by the development team can be found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XsaJwKKBYo&amp;feature=related.

=== Two Legs ===

Two legged robots have probably seen the most development dollars since humanoid robots have been envisioned since the very beginning of the field.  Much of the development in passive dynamic walking has been done in this area.  The design of a bipedal passive dynamic walker begins with the concept of a wheel with spokes.  If the wheel is divided into sections, and all but two removed, we have what appears to be a set of legs.  When the mass is properly distributed, the legs each act as inverted pendulums and the robots “rolls” through its steps.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
| [[Image:Wheel_1.jpg‎ |150px]]
| [[Image:Wheel_2.jpg‎ |150px]]
| [[Image:Wheel_3.jpg‎ |150px]]
| [[Image:Wheel_4.jpg |150px]]
|}

Further complexity can be added to the model by using knee joints to shorten the legs (allowing one to swing past the other without touching the ground) and ankle joints that can provide a “spring” to the step to add lost energy back into the system.  For a more in-depth explanation of passive dynamics walking visit http://www-personal.umich.edu/~artkuo/Passive_Walk/passive_walking.html.

There are several robots that have used these concepts to achieve firsts in the field of robotics.  “RunBot,” developed in Germany and Scotland, broke the speed record per size for a robot in April 2006 by walking at 3.5 leg-lengths per second.{{ref|robotRecord}} The Cornell Ranger, while not truly passive, is passive inspired and one of many robots that has more than two legs but is still classified as bipedal.  When viewed from the side, Ranger appears to have only two legs, but it actually has four legs.  These four legs act in pairs of two, qualifying it as bipedal but providing better lateral stability.  On April 3, 2008 Ranger walked 9.07 kilometers without stopping, an unofficial record at that time (it has since been surpassed, according to the Cornell team, by Boston Dynamic’s Big Dog).{{ref|Ranger}}

One of the most successful companies at building bipedal robots over the years has been Honda.  Their most recent model, ASIMO, is one of the few bipedal robots that appears humanoid, can climb stairs, and carries its own power supply. ASIMO can also change its gait in real time using Honda’s i-WALK technology.  This allows ASIMO to continuously change speeds and direction.  The robot can walk up stairs and run up to four miles per hour.{{ref|Asimo}}

=== One Leg ===

1980 and 1993 there was a lot of research in making one legged robots at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  The MIT lab turned out a series of “MIT hoppers” that could balance themselves and traverse a path.  The biggest challenge with the hoppers was that they could not stand still; they needed to continue hopping in order to maintain their balance. Researchers were able to build a 3-D One-Leg Hopper that “hopped in place, traveled at a specific rate, followed simple paths, and maintained balance when disturbed.”{{ref|MITLegs}}  They also constructed a hopper named Uniroo that used an actuated tail to maintain its balance.{{ref|MITLegs}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Arms are types of jointed robot manipulator that allow robots to interact with their environment.  Many have onboard controllers or translators to simplify communication, though they may be controlled directly or in any number of ways.  Due to this fact, standalone arms are often classified as full robots.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Types of Robotic Arms'''&lt;/center&gt;
There are many different types of robotic arms, but most can be characterized into one of six major categories by their mechanical structure.  Cartesian (also known as Gantry) robots have three joints that are coincident with the standard X-Y-Z Cartesian axes.  Cylindrical arms have any number of joints that operate on a cylindrical axis, normally rotating about one fixed rod.  Spherical (polar) arms are those with joints that allow it full rotation throughout a spherical range.  SCARA robots have two parallel rotary joints to allow full movement throughout a plane, typically for pick-and-place work.  Articulated robots are used for complex assembly operations, and consist of three or more rotary joints.  Parallel robots have three concurrent prismatic or rotary joints, and allow for tilting of heavy or sensitive platforms.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:MultiArm.jpg|none|thumb|507px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;(Left to Right) Gantry Robot, Articulated Robot, SCARA Robot&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Applications'''&lt;/center&gt;
Robotic arms are typically used in industry.  Repetitive autonomous robots perform one task repeatedly based upon predetermined movements and specifically located objects.  Start and stop commands are determined by position, acceleration, deceleration, distance, and direction.  More complex actions are executed based upon sensor processing.  If object orientation or position is unknown, arms are often paired with machine vision and artificial intelligence to identify the object and subsequently control the arm.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:FactorySetup.jpg|none|thumb|333px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Standard Robotic Factory Setup&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Parameters'''&lt;/center&gt;
Arms are typically defined by fourteen different parameters.  

'''Number of Axes''' – Two axes are needed to reach any point in a plane.  Three are required to reach a point in space.  Roll, pitch, and yaw control are required for full control of the end manipulator.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Degrees of Freedom''' – Number of points a robot can be directionally controlled around.  A human arm has seven degrees; articulated arms typically have up to 6.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Working Envelope''' – Region of space a robot can encompass.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Working Space''' – The region in space a robot can fully interact with.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Kinematics''' – Arrangement and types of joints (Cartesian, Cylindrical, Spherical, SCARA, Articulated, Parallel)&lt;BR&gt;
'''Payload''' – Amount that can be lifted and carried&lt;BR&gt;
'''Speed''' – May be defined by individual or total angular or linear movement speed&lt;BR&gt;
'''Acceleration''' – Limits maximum speed over short distances.  Acceleration is given in terms of each degree of freedom or by axis.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Accuracy''' – Given as a best case with modifiers based upon movement speed and position from optimal within the envelope.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Repeatability''' – More closely related to precision than accuracy.  Robots with a low repeatability factor and high accuracy often need only to be recalibrated.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Motion Control''' – For certain applications, arms may only need to move to certain points in the working space.  They may also need to interact with all possible points.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Power Source''' – Electric motors or hydraulics are typically used, though new methods are emerging and being tested.&lt;BR&gt;
'''Drive''' – Motors may be hooked directly to segments for direct drive.  They may also be attached via gears or in a harmonic drive system&lt;BR&gt;
'''Compliance''' – Measure of the distance or angle a robot joint will move under a force.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''End Effectors'''&lt;/center&gt;
The arm itself is only responsible for positioning.  An end effector is necessary for actual environmental interaction.  Some common choices are grippers, sprayers, grinders, welders, and vacuums, though many other options are available.  There is a large variance in complexity, ranging from flush mounted, non-moving parts (magnets or sticky pads) to multi-jointed, multi-sensor parts with various inputs and outputs.  End effectors are typically chosen based upon the application, and many arms will fit multiple end effectors.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Distribution'''&lt;/center&gt;
A 2006 Japanese report shows that 60% of robotic arm installations were for articulated robots, 22% were for gantry, 13% were SCARA, and 4% were Cylindrical.  The automobile industry has the highest concentration of industrial robots with nearly 1 robot per 10 people.&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;center&gt;'''Biological Modeling'''&lt;/center&gt;
Biological design of robotic components is becoming increasingly popular.  Currently, the Shadow Company (famous for the Shadow Hand) is working on a biomorphic arm that accurately models a human arm.  The arm has seven degrees of freedom like the human arm which greatly increases its efficiency.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:shadowhand.jpg|none|thumb|500px|&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;The Shadowhand&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

Researchers at Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA in Stuttgart have begun working on an arm that is modeled after an elephant’s trunk.  The arm uses a cord that is connected to a drive shaft at its midpoint.  When the shaft turns, the cord wraps around it both ways forming a double helix.  Their prototype arm uses ten of these cord systems with two motors attached to each (the second acts as a failsafe for increased safety).

Similarly, biologists at Hebrew University in Jerusalem are studying Octopi tentacles as a possible model for future robotic arm development.  An prototype has not yet been built, but arm design has recently begun.

Additionally, two monkeys learned to control robotic arms through sensors implanted on their brains in a study performed the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.  While not currently practical, the study confirms that brain-controlled prosthetics are feasible and has sparked interest in the area.&lt;BR&gt;

==Getting Firefox==
Firefox can be downloaded from [http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/ this page]. Pressing the large green button will download Firefox. To get a version of Firefox in another language, see [http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/all this page].

==Installing==
[[Image:Windows_Firefox_Installer.png|right|thumb|200px|Firefox Windows Installer]]
===Microsoft Windows===
Firefox supports various versions of Windows including 98, 98SE, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP,Server 2003,  Vista and Windows 7 although it is possible to run Firefox in Windows 95 [http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/windows_95/]. Builds for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition also exist [http://www.mozilla-x86-64.com/]. The Microsoft Windows version of Firefox is distributed as an executable installer.
However, starting in Firefox 3.0, there's only support for Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.

To install, double click on Firefox Setup &lt;version&gt;.exe (where &lt;version&gt; is a number) and follow the installation instructions. Choosing the standard installation is recommended for most new users. This will install Firefox under Program Files.


You can run Firefox from the Program Files entry or by double-clicking the Firefox icon on your desktop. The first run of Firefox will give you the  option of importing your settings from Internet Explorer (or any other browser installed on you computer). Choosing 'Yes' will import all your bookmarks (also known as favorites), saved passwords, history and browsing options. After it finishes importing all these settings, the Firefox browser will start up and a dialog box will pop-up alerting you that Firefox is not set as the default browser. Selecting 'Yes' will associate Firefox with web related files on your PC and Firefox will also open when links are selected from (most) external applications, such as from an instant messenger.

After setting Firefox as the default browser, it should automatically appear on the Windows XP new-style Start menu under the &quot;Internet&quot; option. However, if it doesn't, it can be manually set. Right click on the Start button and select &quot;Properties&quot;. From there, select &quot;Customize...&quot;, and select &quot;Mozilla Firefox&quot; next to the &quot;Internet&quot; checkbox.

[[Image:MacOSX_Firefox_Install_Window.png|right|thumb|200px|Firefox MacOSX Disc Image]]

===Mac OS X===
Double click on the compressed Disk Image to mount it. Drag the Firefox application icon to the &quot;Applications&quot; folder on your hard drive. Do not double-click the Firefox icon inside the Disk Image; doing so can cause a program hang. To make Firefox always appear in the dock, drag the icon from the &quot;Applications&quot; folder to the dock.

===Linux===
Many distributions now come with Firefox included. Check your distribution's documentation for details. There should be a Firefox icon in your desktop environment's program menu.

If your distribution does not come with Firefox pre-installed, you may download it from the official Firefox website. Once the download is complete, decompress the file, which can be done usually by opening the file in a file archiver (such as ark or file roller) and extract it to another folder. Alternatively, typing &lt;tt&gt;tar -xvzf firefox-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;tar -xvzf firefox*&lt;/tt&gt; at a command line will generate directory named &quot;firefox.&quot; This directory can be moved anywhere. Typing &lt;tt&gt;./firefox&lt;/tt&gt; in the shell from the install directory should run Firefox.

=== Other Operating Systems ===
Since the Mozilla Foundation makes the Firefox source code available, users can also compile and run Firefox on a variety of other architectures and operating systems. Operating systems not supported by Firefox, but known to run the browser include:

* Solaris (x86 and SPARC)
* OS/2
* AIX
* FreeBSD
* PC-BSD
* NetBSD
* BeOS
* SkyOS
* RISC OS (ARM)
* OpenBSD

Often, we need to find the integral of a function that may be difficult to integrate analytically (ie, as a definite integral) or impossible (the function only existing as a table of values).

Some methods of approximating said integral are listed below.

== Trapezoidal Rule ==
Consider some function, possibly unknown,  &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, with known values over the interval [a,b] at n+1 evenly spaced points x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of spacing &lt;math&gt;h={(b-a) \over n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_0=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n=b&lt;/math&gt;.  

Further, denote the function value at the ith mesh point as &lt;math&gt;f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;.

Using the notion of integration as &quot;finding the area under the function curve&quot;, we can denote the integral over the ith segment of the interval, from &lt;math&gt;x_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; as:

&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;  =  (1)

Since we may not know the antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we must approximate it.  Such approximation in the Trapezoidal Rule, unsurprisingly, involves approximating (1) with a trapezoid of width h, left height &lt;math&gt;f(x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;, right height &lt;math&gt;f(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus,

(1) &lt;math&gt;\simeq {1 \over 2}h(f(x_{i-1}) + f(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;  =  (2)

(2) gives us an approximation to the area under one interval of the curve, and must be repeated to cover the entire interval.

For the case where n = 2,

&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_a}^{x_b} f(x)\, dx \simeq {1 \over 2}h(f(x_0) + f(x_1)) + {1 \over 2}h(f(x_{1}) + f(x_2))&lt;/math&gt;  = (3)


Collecting like terms on the right hand side of (3) gives us:

&lt;math&gt; {1 \over 2} h (f(x_0) + f(x_1) + f(x_1) + f(x_2)) &lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt; {1 \over 2} h (f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + f(x_2)) &lt;/math&gt;

Now, substituting in for h and cleaning up,

&lt;math&gt; {(b-a) \over 2\cdot2} (f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + f(x_2)) &lt;/math&gt;


To motivate the general version of the trapezoidal rule, now consider n = 4,

&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_a}^{x_b} f(x)\, dx \simeq {1 \over 2}h(f(x_0) + f(x_1)) + {1 \over 2}h(f(x_1) + f(x_2)) + {1 \over 2}h(f(x_2) + f(x_3)) + {1 \over 2}h(f(x_3) + f(x_4))&lt;/math&gt;

Following a similar process as for the case when n=2, we obtain

&lt;math&gt; {(b-a) \over 2\cdot4} (f(x_0) + 2(f(x_1) + f(x_2) + f(x_3)) + f(x_4)) &lt;/math&gt;

Proceeding to the general case where n = N,

&lt;math&gt; \int_{x_a}^{x_b} f(x)\, dx \simeq {(b-a) \over 2 \cdot n} (f(x_0) + 2(\sum_{k=1}^Nf(x_k)) + f(x_n)) &lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Trapizoidruleexample.jpg]]
This is an example of what the trapezoidal rule would represent graphicly, here &lt;math&gt; y = -x^2 + 5 &lt;/math&gt;.


=== Example ===
Approximate &lt;math&gt; \int_{0}^{1} x^3\, dx &lt;/math&gt; to within 5%.

First, since the function can be exactly integrated, let us do so, to provide a check on our answer.

&lt;math&gt; \int_{0}^{1} x^3\, dx = \left [{x^4 \over 4}\right ]_0^1 = {1 \over 4} = 0.25 &lt;/math&gt; = (4)

We will start with an interval size of 1, only considering the end points.

&lt;math&gt; f(0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(1) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

(4) &lt;math&gt; \simeq {(1-0) \over (2\cdot1)} (f(0) + f(1)) = {1 \over 2.1} (0 + 1) = {1 \over 2} = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;

Relative error = &lt;math&gt; \left |{ (0.5-0.25) \over 0.25}  \right | = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Hmm, a little high for our purposes.  So, we halve the interval size to 0.5 and add to the list

&lt;math&gt; f(0.5) = 0.125 &lt;/math&gt;

(4) &lt;math&gt; \simeq {(1-0) \over (2\cdot2)} (f(0) + 2f(0.5) +  f(1)) = {1 \over 2\cdot2} (0 + 2(0.125) + 1) = {1.25 \over 4} = 0.3125&lt;/math&gt;

Relative error = &lt;math&gt; \left |{ (0.3125-0.25) \over 0.25}  \right | = 0.25 &lt;/math&gt;

Still above 0.01, but vastly improved from the initial step.  We continue in the same fashion, calculating &lt;math&gt;f(0.25)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(0.75)&lt;/math&gt;, rounding off to four decimal places.

&lt;math&gt; f(0.25) = 0.0156 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(0.75) = 0.4219 &lt;/math&gt;

(4) &lt;math&gt; \simeq {(1-0) \over (2\cdot4)} ( 0 + 2(0.0156 + 0.125 + 0.4219) + 1) = {1 \over 8} (2.2150) = 0.2656 &lt;/math&gt;

Relative error = &lt;math&gt; \left |{ (0.2656-0.25) \over 0.25}  \right | = 0.0624 &lt;/math&gt;

We are well on our way.  Continuing, with interval size 0.125 and rounding as before,

&lt;math&gt; f(0.125) = 0.0020 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(0.375) = 0.0527 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(0.625) = 0.2441 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(0.875) = 0.6699 &lt;/math&gt;


(4) &lt;math&gt; \simeq {(1-0) \over (2\cdot8)} (0 + 2(0.0020 + 0.0156 + 0.0527 + 0.0125 + 0.2441 + 0.4219 + 0.6699) + 1) = {1 \over 16} (4.0624) = 0.2539 &lt;/math&gt;

Relative error = &lt;math&gt; \left |{ (0.2539-0.25) \over 0.25}  \right | = 0.0156 &lt;/math&gt;

Since our relative error is less than 5%, we stop.

=== Error Analysis ===
Let y=f(x) be continuous,well-behaved and have continuous derivatives in [x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]. We expand y in a Taylor series about x=x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,thus-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_0}^{x_1}y\, dx=\int_{x_0}^{x_1}[y_0+(x-x_0)y'_0+(x-x_0)^2y''_0/2!+......]\,dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Simpson's Rule ==
Consider some function &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; possibily unknown with known values over the interval [a,b] at n+1 evently spaced points then it defined as

&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_0}^{x_n} f(x)\, dx \simeq {1 \over 3}h \bigg\{f(x_0) + f(x_n) + 2\Big(f(x_2) + f(x_4) + ... + f(x_{n-2})\Big) + 4\Big(f(x_1) + f(x_3) + ... + f(x_{n-1})\Big)\bigg\}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h={(b-a) \over n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_0=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_n=b&lt;/math&gt;.  

=== Example ===
Evaluate &lt;math&gt;
\int\limits_0^{1.2} {x\left( {8 - x^3 } \right)^{\frac{1}
{2}} dx} &lt;/math&gt; by taking &lt;math&gt;n = 6&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; must be even)

Solution: Here &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x\left( {8 - x^3 } \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;b = 1.2&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;h = \frac{{b - a}}{n} = \frac{{1.2 - 0}}{6} = 0.2&lt;/math&gt;

Now when &lt;math&gt;a = x_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; f(x_0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

And since &lt;math&gt;x_n  = x_{n - 1}  + h&lt;/math&gt;, therefore for &lt;math&gt;x_1 = 0.2&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_2 = 0.4&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_3 = 0.6&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_4 = 0.8&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_5 = 1&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;x_6 = b = 1.2&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding values are &lt;math&gt;f(x_1) = 0.7784&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f(x_2) = 1.58721&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f(x_3) = 1.6740&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f(x_4) = 2.1891&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f(x_5) = 2.6458&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;f(x_6) = 3.0053&lt;/math&gt;

== Simpson's 3/8 ==

== Description ==
Unsigned integers in Ada have a value range from 0 to some positive number (not necessarily 1 subtracted from some power of 2). They are defined using the {{Ada/kw|mod}} keyword because they implement a wrap-around arithmetic.

  {{Ada/kw|mod}} Modulus

where '{{Ada/attribute|First}} is 0 and '{{Ada/attribute|Last}} is Modulus - 1.

Wrap-around arithmetic means that 'Last + 1 = 0 = 'First, and 'First - 1 = 'Last. Additionally to the normal arithmetic operators, bitwise {{Ada/kw|and}}, {{Ada/kw|or}} and {{Ada/kw|xor}} are defined for the type (see below).

The predefined package {{Ada/package|Interfaces}} (RM {{Ada/RM2|B|2|}}) presents unsigned integers based on powers of 2

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Unsigned_''n'' {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 2**''n'';

for which also shift and rotate operations are defined. The values of ''n'' depend on compiler and target architecture.

You can use {{Ada/kw|range}} to sub-range a modular type:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Byte {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 256;
 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Half_Byte {{Ada/kw|is}} Byte {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. 127;

But beware: the Modulus of Half_Byte is still 256! Arithmetic with such a type is interesting to say the least.

== Bitwise Operations ==

Be very careful with bitwise operators {{Ada/kw|and}}, {{Ada/kw|or}}, {{Ada/kw|xor}}, {{Ada/kw|not}}, when the modulus is not a power of two.
An examply might exemplify the problem.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Unsigned {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 2**5;   -- modulus 32
 X: Unsigned := 2#10110#;     -- 22
 {{Ada/kw|not}} X        = 2#01001#      -- bit reversal: 9 ( = 31 - 22 ) as expected

The other operators work similarly.

Now take a modulus that is not a power of two. Naive expectations about the results may lead out of the value range.
As an example take again the {{Ada/kw|not}} operator (see  the RM for the others):

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Unsigned {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 5;
 X: Unsigned := 2#001#;  -- 1, bit reversal: 2#110# = 6 leads out of range

The definition of {{Ada/kw|not}} is therefore:

  {{Ada/kw|not}} X = Unsigned'Last – X  -- here: 4 – 1 = 2#011#

__TOC__
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
An '''enumeration''' type is defined as a list of possible values:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Primary_Color {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Green, Blue);

Like for numeric types, where e.g. 1 is an integer literal, Red, Green and Blue are called the literals of this type. There are no other values assignable to objects of this type.

== Operators and attributes ==

Apart from equality (&quot;=&quot;), the only operators on enumeration types are the ordering [[Ada Programming/Operators|operators]]: &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;=&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, &quot;/=&quot;, &quot;&gt;=&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;, where the order relation is given implicitly by the sequence of literals: Each literal has a position, starting with 0 for the first, incremented by one for each successor. This position can be queried via the 'Pos [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]]; the inverse is 'Val, which returns the corresponding literal. In our example:

 Primary_Color'{{Ada/attribute|Pos}} (Red) = 0
 Primary_Color'{{Ada/attribute|Val}} (0)   = Red

There are two other important attributes: {{Ada/attribute|Image}} and {{Ada/attribute|Value}} (don't confuse {{Ada/attribute|Val}} with {{Ada/attribute|Value}}). {{Ada/attribute|Image}} returns the string representation of the value (in capital letters), {{Ada/attribute|Value}} is the inverse:

 Primary_Color'{{Ada/attribute|Image}} ( Red ) = &quot;RED&quot;
 Primary_Color'{{Ada/attribute|Value}} (&quot;Red&quot;) =  Red

These attributes are important for simple [[Ada Programming/Input Output|IO]] (there are more elaborate IO facilities in {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}} for enumeration types). Note that, since Ada is case-insensitive, the string given to 'Value can be in any case.

== Enumeration literals ==
Literals are overloadable, i.e. you can have another type with the same literals.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Yellow, Green);

Overload resolution within the context of use of a literal normally resolves which Red is meant. Only if you have an unresolvable overloading conflict, you can qualify with special syntax which Red is meant:

 Primary_Color'(Red)

Like many other declarative items, enumeration literals can be renamed. In fact, such a literal is a actually [[Ada Programming/Subprograms#Functions|function]], so it has to be renamed as such:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Red {{Ada/kw|return}} P.Primary_Color {{Ada/kw|renames}} P.Red;

Here, Primary_Color is assumed to be defined in package P, which is visible at the place of the renaming declaration. Renaming makes Red directly visible without necessity to resort the use-clause.

Note that redeclaration as a function does not affect the staticness of the literal.

=== Characters as enumeration literals ===
Rather unique to Ada is the use of character literals as enumeration literals:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} ABC {{Ada/kw|is}} ('A', 'B', 'C');

This literal 'A' has '''nothing''' in common with the literal 'A' of the predefined type Character (or Wide_Character).

Every type that has at least one character literal is a character type. For every character type, string literals and the concatenation [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/&amp;|operator &quot;&amp;&quot;]] are also implicitly defined.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Character {{Ada/kw|is}} (No_Character, 'a', Literal, 'z');
 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_String {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Positive {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} My_Character;
 
 S: My_String := &quot;aa&quot; &amp; Literal &amp; &quot;za&quot; &amp; 'z';
 T: My_String := ('a', 'a', Literal, 'z', 'a', 'z');

In this example, S and T have the same value.

Ada's Character type is defined that way. See [[Ada Programming/Libraries/Standard]].

=== Booleans as enumeration literals ===

Also Booleans are defined as enumeration types:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Boolean {{Ada/kw|is}} (False, True);

There is special semantics implied with this declaration in that objects and expressions of this type can be used as conditions. Note that the literals False and True are not Ada keywords.

Thus it is not sufficient to declare a type with these literals and then hope objects of this type can be used like so:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Boolean {{Ada/kw|is}} (False, True);
  Condition: My_Boolean;
 
  {{Ada/kw|if}} Condition {{Ada/kw|then}}  -- wrong, won't compile

If you need your own Booleans (perhaps with special size requirements), you have to derive from the predefined Boolean:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} My_Boolean {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Boolean;
  Condition: My_Boolean;
 
  {{Ada/kw|if}} Condition {{Ada/kw|then}}  -- OK

== Enumeration subtypes ==

You can use &lt;tt&gt;{{Ada/kw|range}}&lt;/tt&gt; to subtype an enumeration type:

  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Capital_Letter {{Ada/kw|is}} Character {{Ada/kw|range}} 'A' .. 'Z';

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Week {{Ada/kw|is}} (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday);
  
  {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Working_Day {{Ada/kw|is}} Day_Of_Week {{Ada/kw|range}} Monday .. Friday;

== Description ==
{{Wikipedia|Floating point}}

To define a floating point type, you only have to say how many '''[[Ada Programming/Keywords/digits|digits]]''' are needed, i.e. you define the relative precision:

 {{Ada/kw|digits}} Num_Digits

If you like, you can declare the minimum range needed as well:

 {{Ada/kw|digits}} Num_Digits '''[[Ada Programming/Keywords/range|range]]''' Low .. High

This facility is a great benefit of Ada over (most) other programming languages. In other languages, you just choose between &quot;float&quot; and &quot;long float&quot;, and what most people do is:
* choose float if they don't care about accuracy
* otherwise, choose long float, because it is the best you can get

In either case, you don't know what accuracy you get.

In Ada, you specify the accuracy you need, and the compiler will choose an appropriate floating point type with ''at least'' the accuracy you asked for. This way, your requirement is guaranteed. Moreover, if the computer has more than two floating point types available, the compiler can make use of all of them.

==Parallel Programming Models==
There are generally two ways to accomplish parallel architectures.  They can be either used separately or the architecture can be any combination of the two.  The shared memory model is a model where all processors in the architecture share memory and address spaces.  All the processors in the architecture can access all of the attached main memory.  The message passing model is a model that puts the information into messages.  Discrete units of information that can be passed around to the various CPU's in the architecture.  Both architectures have their advantages and disadvantages.
===Shared memory===
Shared memory models are models where all CPU's can address the main memory of the machine.  Generally the main memory is accessible though a bus.  This allows all CPU's to use memory addresses, and addresses can be passed around to different CPU's.  Having all CPU's access the memory through a bus introduces a number of issues.  Such as bandwidth of the bus, clearly if a bus is small and there are a large number of CPU's then optimization of the CPU usage is going to be difficult to achieve.  Often bus communication is augmented with local cache.  Processor L1 and L2 cache, this then introduces the challenge of cache coherence.  How to assure that the data in main memory and cache are up to date enough, such that all CPU's will see the appropriate data.  There are several strategies to proper and optimized operation here.
===Message passing===
Message passing systems have memory that is either not directly connected to the CPU or even possibly spread across various geographic locations.  This results in a system of send and receives, where the data is packed into a message and sent across a network to various other machines in the network.

== History of distributed computing ==
=== The Eighties and Nineties: PVM and MPI ===

=== Today: GFS, MapReduce, Hadoop ===

====Hadoop====

Hadoop at it's core is a combination of two open source frameworks,  MapReduce and HDFS.  Both are open source implementations based on white papers published by Google.   MapReduce is a processing framework based on a Google framework of the same name.  MapReduce takes the data stored in HDFS and processes it on each node in the cluster.  MapReduce consists of two procedures defined by the programmer.  The Map and the Reduce.  Mappers take lines in the form of keys and values.  Mappers also emit keys and values.  The Reducer has an input format that is a key and a vector of all the values for that key that were emitted by the mapper.  HDFS is the Hadoop filesystem.  HDFS is an implementation of Google distributed filesystem.  HDFS is a software implementation that distributes the storage of files across multiple nodes in a cluster.  There is a default replication factor of three to assure with a high degree of certainty that no data is lost.

==Mathematics of parallel processing ==
Parallel processing is the simultaneous execution of the same task (split up and specially adapted) on multiple processors in order to obtain faster results. The parallel nature can come from a single machine with multiple processors or multiple machines connected together to form a cluster.

=== Amdahl's law ===
Amdahl's law is a demonstration of the [[w:Diminishing returns|law of diminishing returns]]: while one could speed up part of a computer a hundred-fold or more, if the improvement only affects 12% of the overall task, the best the [[w:speedup|speedup]] could possibly be is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1 - 0.12} = 1.136&lt;/math&gt; times faster.

More technically, the law is concerned with the [[w:speedup|speedup]] achievable from an improvement to a computation that affects a proportion ''P'' of that computation where the improvement has a speedup of ''S''. (For example, if an improvement can speedup 30% of the computation, ''P'' will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the portion affected twice as fast, ''S'' will be 2.) Amdahl's law states that the overall speedup of applying the improvement will be

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \frac{P}{S}}&lt;/math&gt;.

To see how this formula was derived, assume that the running time of the old computation was 1, for some unit of time. The running time of the new computation will be the length of time the unimproved fraction takes (which is 1 &amp;minus; ''P'') plus the length of time the improved fraction takes. The length of time for the improved part of the computation is the length of the improved part's former running time divided by the speedup, making the length of time of the improved part ''P''/''S''. The final speedup is computed by dividing the old running time by the new running time, which is what the above formula does.

==== Parallelization ====
In the special case of parallelization, Amdahl's law states that if ''F'' is the fraction of a calculation that is sequential (i.e. cannot benefit from parallelisation), and (1 &amp;minus; ''F'') is the fraction that can be parallelised, then the maximum speedup that can be achieved by using ''N'' processors is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{F + (1-F)/N}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the limit, as ''N'' tends to [[w:infinity|infinity]], the maximum speedup tends to 1/''F''. In practice, price/performance ratio falls rapidly as ''N'' is increased once (1 &amp;minus; ''F'')/''N'' is small compared to ''F''.

As an example, if ''F'' is only 10%, the problem can be sped up by only a maximum of a factor of 10, no matter how large the value of ''N'' used. For this reason, [[w:parallel computing|parallel computing]] is only useful for either small numbers of [[w:processor|processor]]s, or problems with very low values of ''F'': so-called [[w:embarrassingly parallel|embarrassingly parallel]] problems. A great part of the craft of [[w:parallel programming|parallel programming]] consists of attempting to reduce ''F'' to the smallest possible value.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Description ==
{{Wikipedia|Fixed-point arithmetic}}
A fixed point type defines a set of values that are evenly spaced with a given absolute precision. In contrast, floating point values are all spaced according to a relative precision.

The absolute precision is given as the delta of the type. There are two kinds of fixed point types, ordinary and decimal.

For '''Ordinary Fixed Point''' types, the delta gives a hint to the compiler how to choose the small value if it is not specified: It can be ''any integer power of two'' not greater than delta. You may specify the small via an attribute clause to be ''any value'' not greater than delta. (If the compiler cannot conform to this small value, it has to reject the declaration.)

For '''Decimal Fixed Point''' types, the small is defined to be the delta, which in turn must be an integer power of ten. (Thus you cannot specify the small by an attribute clause.)

For example, if you define a decimal fixed point type with a delta of 0.1, you will be able to accurately store the values 0.1, 1.0, 2.2, 5.7, etc. You will not be able to accurately store the value 0.01. Instead, the value will be rounded down to 0.0.

If the compiler accepts your fixed point type definition, it guarantees that values represented by that type will have at least the degree of accuracy specified (or better). If the compiler cannot support the type definition (e.g. due to limited hardware) then a compile-time error will result.

== Ordinary Fixed Point ==

For an ordinary fixed point, you just define the delta and a range:

 {{Ada/kw|delta}} ''Delta'' {{Ada/kw|range}} ''Low'' .. ''High''

The delta can be any real value &amp;mdash; for example you may define a circle with one arcsecond resolution with:

 {{Ada/kw|delta}} 1 / (60 * 60) {{Ada/kw|range}} 0.0 .. 360.0

[There is one rather strange rule about fixed point types: Because of the way they are internally represented, the range might only go up to &lt;code&gt;'Last - Delta&lt;/code&gt;. This is a bit like a circle &amp;mdash; the 0° and 360° mark is also the same.]

It should be noted that in the example above the smallest possible value used is not &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{60^2} = \frac{1}{3600}&lt;/math&gt;. The compiler will choose a smaller value which, by default, is an integer power of 2 not greater than the delta. In our example this could be &lt;math&gt;2^{-12} = \frac{1}{4096}&lt;/math&gt;. In most cases this should render better performance but sacrifices precision for it.

If this is not what you wish and precision is indeed more important, you can choose your own small value via the attribute clause '{{Ada/attribute|Small}}.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Angle {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|delta}} Pi/2.0**31 {{Ada/kw|range}} -Pi .. Pi;
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Angle'Small {{Ada/kw|use}} Pi/2.0**31;

As internal representation, you will get a 32 bit signed integer type.

== Decimal Fixed Point ==

You define a decimal fixed point by defining the delta and the number of digits needed:

  {{Ada/kw|delta}} ''Delta'' {{Ada/kw|digits}} ''Num_Digits''

Delta must be a positive or negative integer power of 10 &amp;mdash; otherwise the declaration is illegal.

 {{Ada/kw|delta}} 10.0**(+2) {{Ada/kw|digits}} 12
 {{Ada/kw|delta}} 10.0**(-2) {{Ada/kw|digits}} 12

If you like, you can also define the range needed:

 {{Ada/kw|delta}} Delta_Value {{Ada/kw|digits}} Num_Digits {{Ada/kw|range}} Low .. High

== Differences between Ordinary and Decimal Fixed Point Types ==

There is an alternative way of declaring a &quot;decimal&quot; fixed point: You declare an ordinary fixed point and use an integer power of 10 as '{{Ada/attribute|Small}}. The following two declarations are equivalent with respect to the internal representation:

 -- decimal fixed point
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Duration {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|delta}} 10.0**(-9) {{Ada/kw|digits}} 9;

 -- ordinary fixed point
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Duration {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|delta}} 10.0**(-9) {{Ada/kw|range}} -1.0 .. 1.0;
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Duration'{{Ada/attribute|Small}} {{Ada/kw|use}} 10.0**(-9);

You might wonder what the difference then is between these two declarations. The answer is:

''None with respect to precision, addition, subtraction, multiplication with integer values.''

The following is an incomplete list of differences between ordinary and decimal fixed point types.

* Decimal fixed point types are intended to reflect typical '''COBOL''' declarations with a given number of digits.

* Truncation is required for decimal, not for ordinary, fixed point in multiplication and division (RM {{Ada/95/RM|4|5|5|title=(21)}}) and type conversions. Operations on decimal fixed point are fully specified, which is not true for ordinary fixed point.

* The following attributes are only defined for decimal fixed point: T'Digits (RM {{Ada/95/RM|3|5|10|title=(10)}}) corresponds to the number of decimal digits that are representable; T'Scale (RM {{Ada/95/RM|3|5|10|title=(11)}}, taken from '''COBOL''') indicates the position of the point relative to the rightmost significant digits; T'Round (RM {{Ada/95/RM|3|5|10|title=(12)}}) can be used to specify rounding on conversion.

* Package Decimal (RM {{Ada/95/RM|F|2|title=}}), which of course applies only to decimal fixed point, defines the decimal Divide generic procedure. If annex F is supported (GNAT does), at least 18 digits must be supported (there is no such rule for fixed point).

* Decimal_IO (RM {{Ada/95/RM|A|10|1|title=(73)}}) has semantics different from Fixed_IO (RM {{Ada/95/RM|A|10|1|title=(68)}}).

* Static expressions must be a multiple of the Small for decimal fixed point.

'''Conclusion:'''
For normal numeric use, an ordinary fixed point (probably with 'Small defined) should be defined. Only if you are interested in COBOL like use, i.e. well defined deterministic decimal semantics (especially for financial computations, but that might apply to cases other than money) should you take decimal fixed point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In encryption, the weakest link is almost always a person.

While you could spend many hours attempting to decipher an encrypted message, or intercept a password, you can easily trick a person into telling you this information.

Suppose Bob works for a large company and encrypts document ''E'' with key ''K''. Suppose Eve, wishing to decrypt document ''E'', calls Bob and pretends to work for the company's information security department. Eve would pretend a problem existed with the computers, servers, etc. and ask Bob for his key, ''K'', which she would use to decrypt ''E''.  This is an example of social engineering.

[http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/security.png Randall Munroe in an xkcd comic] once presented a scenerio in which bad guys find it more convenient to hit Bob with a $5 wrench until he gives up his key rather than attempt to break the crypto system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The strength of your encryption method is based not only on your encryption method, but also on your ability to use it effectively. A perfect encryption method which is finicky to use and hard to get right is not likely to be useful in building a high quality security system.

For example, the [[../One time pads|One-Time Pad]] cypher is the only known provably unbreakable algorithm (in the very strong sense of a more effective than brute force search attack being impossible), but this proof applies ONLY if the key used is completely randomly chosen (there is currently no known method for making such a choice nor is there any known method for demonstrating that any particular choice is random), if the key is a long as the plaintext, if the key is never reused, and if the key never becomes known to the enemy. These conditions are so difficult to ensure that the One-Time Pad is almost never used in actual practice, whatever its theoretical advantages.  

Any use of the One-Time Pad violating those assumed requirements is insecure, sometimes trivially so. For instance, statistical analysis techniques may be immediately applicable, under certain kinds of misuse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt; [[Introduction to Philosophy]]

There may be no philosopher that has had more of an impact on society and politics than Karl Marx.  His theory, in essence, embraces radical and revolutionary change.

Marx argues that the working class, or ''proletariat'', are oppressed and alienated in the process of production (what Marx calls &quot;alienated labor&quot;). Unlike the skilled artisans of the past who could craft a product from start to finish,  industrialization has led to the division of labor into many smaller repetitve processes. For example, a worker might only pull a lever, or attach a rivet, instead of crafting an entire product. In this way, workers became alientated from their final product. Likewise, in the competition of workers to be more 'profitable' to their employers, they initiate a 'race to the bottom' of the wage pile, willing to work for less and less. In this way, workers create strife amongst themselves and must sell themselves to their employers. This alienates themselves from each other (undermining class solidarity) and from their humanity &amp;mdash; with a similar effect as prostitution.

According to Marx, the means of production must be appropriated by the workers and freed from the dehumanizing commodity form to meet the needs of society (production for the benefit of humankind, not for profit of the property-owning and ruling class, the ''bourgeois'').  Marx envisioned and projected a society free from social stratification, in which individual contribution and distribution of goods could be summarized: &quot;From each according to ability, to each according to need.&quot; ([http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm ''Critique of the Gotha Program''], 1875.)

The most influential book written by him was [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto the Communist Manifesto].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Texas Hold'em''' is played in the main event of the World Series of Poker, and is considered by many the most complex and strategic form of poker. In the game everyone tries to make the best 5 card hand they can out of five community cards and two personal cards. In modern games the blinds are then posted. The blinds are forced bets. The player to the left of the dealer puts in the small blind, and the player to the left of the small blind pays the big blind, which is typically twice the small blind. This represents the minimum bet once the action begins. Each player is dealt two cards face down called the hole cards, which they aim to keep secret. Then the first round of betting ensues, with the player to the left of the big blind acting first. After this, a card is discarded and three cards are dealt face up in the middle of the table. These cards are called the flop, and are the first three community cards. There is another round of betting, beginning this time with the small blind. One more card is discarded and one more community card is dealt, called the turn. There is another round of betting, again starting with the small blind, then a discard, and then the final card, called the river, is dealt.  There is one final round of betting and then the players who have not folded turn over their cards.

'''Basic Strategy of Texas Holdem'''

''Note this strategy guide is for playing no limit texas holdem.  Slightly different considerations apply when playing limit or pot limit holdem.  It is also heavily oriented towards tournament play, since this is the format where no-limit is most commonly played.''


==Position==

Position refers to how many players must act after your actions.  It is generally preferable to be the last player to act, since your opponents will often reveal some information about their hand by betting or checking (sometimes they may be trapping you by slowplaying or checkraising) before you act, because you have the choice of taking a free card if no-one else has bet, and for various other reasons.  Position is probably the single most important factor in no-limit hold'em.  The person acting as dealer (also called &quot;being on the button&quot;) will always be last to act (except in the first round), and is thus said to &quot;have position&quot; on all other players. Because the dealer can see what all the other players do it is the most desirable position to occupy post-flop.

The blinds, the button and the cutoff seat (one off the button) are normally referred to as late position; the next two or three seats are middle position; and everything else is early position.  One important thing for a beginner to realize is that the playability of a hand varies greatly according to their position.  Beginners should aim to play fewer than 10% of hands in early position (when you are one of the first to act) but might find 30% playable in late position in an unraised pot.

It is useful to have a shorthand for the pre-flop positions at the table.  For this guide, the big blind will be denoted by BB, the small blind by SB; other positions will be represented by a number, with 0 as the button, 1 as the seat next to the button, 2 being 2 places to the right of the button and so on.

==Principles of Starting Hand Selection==

The single most important thing in choosing which hands to play is to avoid being dominated.

A hand is dominated if it is a non-pair hand facing a higher hand with one card the same, or facing a pair of the same or higher value as one of its cards.  For example, AQ is dominated by AK, QQ, KK and AA.  QJ, which looks like a good hand to beginners, is dominated by AQ, AJ, KQ, KJ, AA, KK, QQ and JJ - that is, virtually any hand playable for a raise but AK and the medium pairs.  A pair is dominated by any higher pair.

This is important not just because the dominated hand is, at best, a 3 to 1 underdog.  The implied losses involved in holding AQ against AK are huge, since it can result in losing a large portion of your stack when an ace flops.  The legendary player Doyle Brunson once gave up playing AQ entirely, saying that it had lost him more money than any other hand.

This leads to the Gap Concept - you need a better hand to call with than to raise with, from any given position.  A player on the dealer button may raise with KJ after the action has been folded around, but should normally fold it to a raise which they judge may represent AK, AJ or KQ.  More on this later.

==Types of hands==

Hands can be divided into a number of types.  The value of the types changes depending on the number of players, the level of the blinds and the player's position on the table.

Some hands here are chosen for their ability to make a useful strong one-pair hand; others are chosen for the ability to make a straight, flush or set.  The latter are known as drawing hands.  A good general rule for drawing hands is: play them in later positions, perhaps the button and positions 1 and 2, and never call with them for more than 5% of the maximum possible return.  The maximum return is, roughly, the minimum of your stack and the opponents stack.  You might well invest more than that when raising, of course, if you have a stealing opportunity.

A few playable hands, which are not mentioned, fall somewhere in between these two - K9 suited, for example, has a value perhaps somewhere close to KJ off.  (But it should be noted that KJ off is not nearly such a strong hand as most beginners would tend to think.)

===Big pairs   (AA KK QQ)===

These cards are a favourite against any hand (except a higher big pair) and must be played aggressively preflop.  The general idea is to make as big a pot as possible with as few opponents as possible - which means that you should very rarely slowplay these hands, unless you are playing opponents who know your style, in which case occasional slowplaying has some value.  However, there are three general rules for these hands in small tournaments: raise, reraise and all in.

Post-flop, by contrast, pays to be careful.  If the pot is small relative to your stack, you are probably only going to find all of your chips in the middle when you are beaten - after all, all you normally have is a one pair hand.  The main worries are overcards, a high pair on the board, or a flop with three cards to a straight or flush, especially a high straight like Q-J-T.  Knowing when to push for maximum value against someone with top pair or a smaller overpair, when to make a player pay for a draw, and when to slow down or throw your hand away is a question of experience.

===High cards (AK AQ AJ KQ AT KJ QJ KT)===

Post flop, the hope with these hands is to make top pair, ideally with top kicker.  For example, if you play AJ and the flop comes J 8 4 of 3 different suits then you are leading against most hands, such as KJ and QJ.  By raising preflop you should eliminate hands such as J8 and 44, or at least make them pay exorbitantly to hit their hand, and so you only need to worry about a player holding 88, JJ or higher.  It is standard practice to bet strongly with top pair here, to make it unprofitable for an opponent with T9 to draw for a straight, and avoid someone hitting an overpair.  T.J. Cloutier has said that 'Hold'em is a game of top pair, top kicker.'

Ace-King should be regarded in a different category from the other hands, since every time it hits it makes top pair, top kicker with minimal possibility of an overpair.  The other hands should be played much more carefully, especially in a raised pot, and especially in a full ring game, where a dominating hand is present much more often than you might think.

===Small and medium suited connectors (JT T9 98 … 43; QT J9 … 53; Q9, all suited)===

Numerically adjacent cards of the same suit are less likely to make a playable hand on the flop than two big cards.  However, when they do make a hand it is usually a very strong one such as a flush, straight, two pair or trips.  While pot odds rarely favour these hands, no limit holdem is a game of implied odds, and making that type of hand can easily allow you to double through.  Against good players they have the additional advantage of making your play less predictable.

With suited connectors the main aim is to enter a pot cheaply against a number of opponents and from a good position, usually either on or one off the button.  With an open-ended straight or flush draw the player will often make a bet called a semi-bluff.  If they are called then they are probably behind, but on drawing the correct card it may be possible to force a player with a hand as weak as top pair-top kicker to move all in.

Suited connectors have the most value in full ring games and with low blinds.  The true connectors, with no gap between them, are more valuable because they are more likely to make a straight.  However the one-gap connectors sometimes gain value from being more deceptive.  The medium, offsuit connectors such as JT and T9 may also be playable in late position.  The smaller offsuit connectors are trash hands from any position.

The medium connectors are excellent hands to find in late position in an unraised pot, since many players are often holding lower connectors, small pairs, and (especially in online play) high-low combinations, where the medium connectors have a distinct edge.  In raised pots the small connectors may become more valuable than the medium ones, however.  For example, if a player raises with AQ and another calls with AK, then a 65 suited will be quite a playable hand in a showdown, since the AQ is such a big underdog.  (There are pathological cases where the 65 can actually be a favourite in a showdown over the AK here.)  Better yet, a flop like A-K-6 will not lose many chips for the player with 65... while a flop like K-6-5 could be quite expensive for the player with AK.  By contrast, a QT would be a very bad hand to have.

===Suited rag aces (Ax suited)===

The ace with a low suited kicker plays very similarly to suited connectors.  While pairing the ace is useful, it can easily cause problems when outkicked by a dominating premium ace, and should be played more like middle pair than top pair.  The idea, however, is to flop a flush draw.  While many inexperienced players will play any two suited cards in the hope of this happening, suited aces have unique advantages here.  

Most obviously, when making an ace-high flush you may have the nuts, and you will break any player with a lower flush.  Also, when the flop brings a flush draw there are two scenarios; there is no ace, in which case you have a flush draw and an overcard, or there is an ace, in which case you have top pair with a flush draw.  This means you have 12 cards to improve your hand above the current top pair by making a flush, pair of aces, or two pair.  This gives a very good chance of winning a showdown.  Unfortunately, the flush is so obvious that it will take very good play to extract maximum value from a solid, conservative player.

It is worth bearing in mind that an ace with a wheel card (2, 3, 4 or 5) is a stronger drawing hand than an A6 or A7.  You may flop a straight, or a flush draw with an inside straight draw, a genuine monster draw with 15 outs over a pair of kings.

===Small and medium pairs (JJ TT .. 22)===

The medium pairs, JJ through 88, are often the hardest hands to play.  For example, suppose a player raised in early position and you called with 99.  The flop comes 8-5-3, and the opponent bets.  It is clearly unlikely that they have paired the flop, since they raised; if they have a pocket pair of eights then they have a set; if they have a higher pair then you are a massive underdog.  All you can beat is a bluff, and even against two overcards you are only a 3-to-1 favourite.  So, the medium pairs require very careful handling after the flop unless you hit a set.  At the same time they are a little too good to throw away to a single raise, and certainly good enough to raise with.  In fact they may be re-raising hands against an aggressive player.

With lower pairs, 77 through 22, hitting an overpair is increasingly unlikely, and they are played more as drawing hands.  The standard plan is to enter the pot as cheaply as possible and with good position, try to make a set on the flop, and release the hand upon failing to hit.  The pair will make a set approximately 12% of the time, which is enough to pay off handsomely, especially since it is nearly impossible to tell whether or not someone has made a set from the cards on the board.

===Trash hands (Almost everything else)===

Trash hands are trash not because they cannot win - any two cards can win, especially in a game where you normally do not show down a hand - but because it is so difficult to make a hand which you can play strongly on the flop.  Take K7 off suit.  When pairing the king it cannot really be played as top pair because of the poor kicker.  When pairing the 7 it is unlikely to be top pair, and also unlikely to remain as top pair once the turn and river have been dealt.  Making two pair can be very profitable, but with only a few percent chance of flopping two pair even the implied odds cannot justify the play.

As a result, trash hands are only playable under certain circumstances.  One is a common scenario at the final table of tournaments.  The blinds are high, giving you little chance to select premium hands, and the table is shorthanded.  This forces gambling play.  By the time a tournament gets down to two players it may be normal to go all-in on being dealt a K7.  They are also playable for a call or check from the blinds in an unraised pot.

It is also possible to play them simply because your position at the table makes playing any two cards advantageous.  This normally occurs when you are the dealer and the players in front of you have passed.  If you are an experienced player or have weak or conservative opponents in the blinds then it can be profitable to play simply for the opportunity to bluff.

Outside the blinds, it is vital to raise when playing these hands preflop, not call.  By raising you give yourself the opportunity to steal the blinds as well as the best chance of finding yourself heads-up, where it is easiest to win with the worst hand. Also, limping in where you cannot call a raise is rarely a good strategy.  This approach  works for some of the best players in the modern game such as Daniel Negranu and Gus Hansen, but it is extremely difficult for inexperienced players, who should normally stick to more playable hands.

==Pre-Flop Tactics==

There is a wide range of pre-flop tactics aimed at winning the pot outright or at least narrowing the range of remaining players before the flop.

===The Button Steal===

While any raise preflop can be seen as an attempt to win the blinds, there is one scenario where it is especially profitable.  This is the previously mentioned situation of having every player before you pass when you are on the button.  If the small and big blind will both fold to a raise of twice the big blind two times out of three then the third time is effectively a freeroll, and a freeroll with good position.  Late game in high level tournaments is dominated by attempts to steal the blinds in this fashion.  Of course, it is possible to steal from positions other than the button, but having late position is very desirable.

===The Squeeze===

The squeeze is best demonstrated by example.  Suppose a player raised and was called in front of you.  A reraise here will place the original raiser in a difficult situation.  They have no way of knowing what the original caller will do, and any chips they place in the pot may have to be surrendered to an all-in by a large pair or similar.  As a result, a good player will not call without a huge hand.  This move almost always either wins the pot outright, or sweetens it and moves to heads-up.  Even some conservative players will make this move with marginal hands such as suited connectors and small pairs.

===The Limp-Reraise===

This tactic is exactly what it sounds like - you limp into the pot, an opponent raises, and you make a big reraise.  This tactic is somewhat frequently used by novice players when the are dealt AA or perhaps KK from an early position.  However, a thinking player could use this play in a variety of situations.  For example, let's say that you are dealt JT suited from a relatively early position, you limp in, another player limps in, and an aggressive player puts in a small to medium sized raise from the button.  If the blinds fold, you should occasionally raise in this spot.  If you do raise, the player who limped after you will almost always fold, and since the button is aggressive and has position, he could easily have a semi-strong hand that he is now forced to fold.  Even if he does call, you still have a disguised holding plus you will get first shot at the pot on the flop.  Three things to understand:  Only use this play on occasion; do not restrict this play to the times when you have a huge hand; try to use this play only against players who may raise with marginal holdings.

===Stealing from the Blinds=== 

This is another play that is best illustrated by example:  A few players limp into the pot; you put in a big raise from the small blind or big blind; everyone folds and you scoop the pot.  This play actually works more often than it sounds like it should.  The best circumstances are when two or three players who like to limp with many different hands enter the pot from middle position and late position, AND when you have a hand that is completely worthless.  The play is wasted when you have a hand that you would like to see a cheap flop with, which may develop into something big (like a suited connector or small pair).  Note that this play also disguises your raises with very good hands.  If the only time that you raise is when you have a big pair or a big A-high, you will be too easily read by your opponents.

==Post Flop Play==

=== Reasons to Bet, Check and Call ===

One of the main mistakes beginners make is acting without a reason.  Or rather, acting with a reason that has to do with their cards rather than with gaining chips.

The main reasons to bet and raise are:

* To gain value

This is the simplest reason.  You have a hand, and you think that your opponent may have a worse hand '''with which they can pay you off'''.  Value bets are the heart of poker.

* To force a better hand to fold

Bluffing, discussed in detail later.  Your chances of winning a showdown are slim, so avoid one.

* To protect a hand 

Almost any hand can be outdrawn, and it is often important to force your opponent to pay for the privilege.  How important this is depends on your hand, the board and your opponent's range of hands.

* To gain information

Betting and raising purely for information is a technical mistake - you are betting in a situation where the bet will not generate income.  However, it may be correct to make a small mistake to avoid a large one later.


The main reasons to check are to:

* Induce a bluff or misrepresent your hand

This might be slowplaying, or it might not in a normal sense; you might check a middle pair to induce a bluff.

* Keep the pot small

If it's not clear whether you are ahead or behind, or are 1 card away from making your hand, why actively build a bigger pot?  Checking a hand down might be a good option in this case because you can bow out if someone (or a few) raise.  Also, having more players in the hand means that your bets vs the total pot are less costly vs the odds of improving your hand.

* Take a free card

In position, especially against a tricky, trapsetting opponent, you might be better off seeing if the next card improves your hand when they check to you.  Out of position you cannot guarantee a free card, of course.

* Gain information

Sometimes, against certain opponents, you might gain more information by checking than by betting.  Be aware of these times.

The reasons for calling might be related to a number of the above - but generally, call when neither folding or raising seems like a good option.

These may seem like simple principles, but balancing them in the many different situations of hold'em is one of the keys to post-flop play.

=== Evaluating the Strength of a Hand ===

There are several factors which affect how strong a hand is besides its face value.

The more superior hands which can be made or drawn to from the flop, the weaker the hand.  Two black aces are excellent preflop, but on a flop of Q J T suited in hearts it becomes a very mediocre holding against the possible flush, straight, two-pair, set and straight flush combinations.

More players in a pot also weakens a hand.  Top pair jacks, ace kicker may be excellent heads-up, but it is far less likely to stand up with 5 players, and almost dead if those players are allowed to remain for the turn and river.

A hand becomes stronger when the amount in the pot is high in relation to the maximum you can lose.  All-in with top pair is normal when the pot is similar in size to your stack, but suicidal with a ratio of 20:1.

Also, in tournaments the size of the blinds in relation to your stack is an important factor.  A shortstack must judge whether it is worth waiting for a better opportunity to double through with a lower stack, or worth making a move now with a weaker hand.

===Evaluating the Strength of an Opponent's Hand===

The first thing to do on the flop is to evaluate whether the opponent has made a hand.  As a rule of thumb, remember this: against one opponent, you will be correct in assuming they missed the flop two times out of three.  If the flop has a pair, it is even more likely that the flop did not help their hand.  Against more than one opponent, you will be wrong two times out of three or more.

Position is the most useful tool in judging their strength.  If they are forced to act before you and check, and if they have no history of check-raising or slowplaying, then it is safe to assume that they hold no hand.  This is not necessarily true if the flop came A K Q -- they may be worried about your hand, or they may have flopped the nuts.

On the other hand, with a flop like 7 5 2, a bet may not mean much, especially if the opponent considers you a tight player.  This type of bluff on a rag flop is so common as to hardly be considered a bluff; they may be simply protecting an ace-high.  

===Bluffing===

The game of poker cannot be played correctly against rational opponents without bluffing.  Of course, not all opponents are rational.  If you find an opponent who invariably calls any reasonable bet on the flop and beyond, then only bet if you have a strong hand -- this sounds obvious, but it is something so alien to many players that world champions have been known to struggle in small stake, friendly games.

There are 3 ways in which bluffing pays off:

*The opponent folds.
*The opponent calls, and you then draw out to a stronger hand against them.
*The opponent calls with a stronger hand, sees the bluff, you lose, but the opponent is more inclined to call bets in future because of it.

Against good opponents it may be that the last of these is actually the most profitable.  

It is very difficult to establish how often you should bluff.  Mathematically, a bet of half the pot breaks even if the opponent(s) fold one time in three, and a pot-sized bet breaks even if they fold half the time, '''based only on the possibility of them folding'''.  Heads up against a conservative, inexperienced  player it may well be profitable to make the first bet on the flop regardless of your hand.  It certainly simplifies decision-making.

The main cost of bluffing on the flop is probably the opportunity cost of slowplaying.  Checking with a very strong hand is something of a tell if you have bet the last 40 flops.

===Slowplaying===
Slowplaying, or trapping, is one of the most dangerous moves in Hold'em.  The principle is to check after making a good hand, allowing the opponent to either bluff at the pot or improve their hand slightly on the next card.

The problem is that the opponent may find themselves drawing to a better hand than yours.  Unless you are able to make some painful laydowns it is important to only trap with hands which are quite unlikely to be outdrawn, given the texture of the flop.

== Flop strategy ==

=== Immediate winners ===

Immediate winners (also known as &quot;monsters&quot;) include nut hands that are impossible to beat (any four of a kind or better, any nut straight or better). With these hands, the imperative is to make as much money as possible. Betting big will scare most players out of the game with many of them guessing your hand, so slowplaying all the way to the showdown is advised. Call very often, but make middle-sized bets if nobody else is inclined to bet. Loose players will often follow you with draws and weaker made hands. You should almost never raise with immediate winners unless you're sure the opponents will call, since your goal is to maximize your winnings. These hands are virtual cheques for the pot and you should almost never fast-play them. Note: beware the nut straight, a connected card on the turn can re-position the nuts!

=== Non-nut winners ===

Non-nut winners include non-nut straight or better. These hands include:
* full houses with xxy-shaped flop and lower-ranking card making your trips &amp;mdash; e.g. flop: 99J, hand: J9 (nut: JJ)
* full houses with xxx-shaped flop and KK or lower in the hole &amp;mdash; e.g. flop: TTT, hand: QQ (nut: Tx)
* flushes where you don't have the highest card in the suit not on the table present in your hand &amp;mdash; e.g. flop: A72, hand: QJ (king is missing!)
* outside straights where you don't have the next two cards higher-ranked than three on the table &amp;mdash; e.g. flop: QJT, hand: K9 (nut: AK)
* gapped straights where you don't have the gap card and the higher next higher-ranked card &amp;mdash; e.g. flop: 986, hand: 75 (nut: T7)

With non-nut winners you have two strategies available: either scare the opponents outright by making large bets or delay that action until the turn. Should a player follow, be prepared to back your hand to the all-in. You should use the first strategy when there are plenty of scare cards possible on the turn and the possibility of completed bigger draws is higher. The second strategy is advisable if the turn doesn't pose a danger. In both cases you must know when to fold.

=== Trips ===

==== Sets ====

Sets are trips where you have the pair in you hand (a pocket pair). The top set is the set where your pocket pair pairs the highest card in the flop. Likewise, at the middle set the middle card is paired and at the lower set the lower card. All sets are very good hands, but seeing the turn is something you want to avoid, since you only have one nut out and many more cards will be scare cards. Nevertheless, a set can be a good hand at the showdown, but it's way more profitable to get out of trouble before the turn. Make large bets (even doubling the pot is okay) to push the opponents out of the pot. Alternatively, if the board doesn't have consecutive cards or cards of same color (unconnected), you can try slow-playing and make people with weaker but still good hands stay in. A set is a great hand, but a low set has to be protected. You should play more passively with top and middle sets, but don't let your betting become predictable.

==== Flopped trips ====

Flopped trips is trips where you have one card in the hole and two in the flop. It is similar to a set, but not as good. Trips are usually slow-played so as not to scare everyone out of the game. (Usually, if you encounter a paired flop, you should be suspicious of a full house or a four of a kind. In this case you should be looking for these hands in other players.) But if the board is connected, be aggressive.

=== Two pair ===

For the purpose of determining the flop strategy, a two pair requires that you have one card of each pair in the hand and one on the table. Two pair where you have a pocket pair and the board is paired is not a good hand and you should never count paired flops toward your two pair.

==== Top two pair and &quot;rags &amp; riches&quot; two pair ====

The top two pair has both top and middle flop card paired with the hole, while the &quot;rags &amp; riches&quot; two pair has the top and bottom card paired. Both are to be slow-played under ideal conditions (uncoordinated board, no hint about immediate winners available from other players). If you see a possible straight or a flush on the board, bet high and raise to scare off drawing hands. Two pair is good, but you're in fact drawing to a full house. You may stay to the showdown, but make sure in most cases you'll be beat by then.

==== Bottom two pair ====

Since the cards you play that are low enough to make the bottom two pair possible, are usually connected, you'll get dangerous flops. Make sure the drawers get out before the turn. There's also the possibility of top card being paired and thus making everyone a top pair and degrading your hand to the level of middle pair, low kicker. This advice is also valid for the &quot;rags &amp; riches&quot; two pair.

=== Pocket pairs ===

Pocket pairs are pairs where both cards are in the hole.

==== Overpair ====

Overpair is a pocket pair bigger than the top card in the flop. When you have the biggest overpairs (pocket aces or kings), slow-play and pretend you bluffed. If you're against multiple opponents, try to filter them out, since the value of an overpair decreases with each new community card. If the overpair isn't that big (usually TT-QQ), bet more aggressively since your overpair isn't that good anymore. Be wary of flops with straight and/or flush draws. If someone chases you persistently at such a flop, you'll probably end up against a made hand or an even-money draw.

==== 2nd pair ====

The 2nd pair is a pocket pair between the top card and the middle card. It is a usual bet/fold position. When in a late position and it's checked to you, take the free card. A strong player betting in front of you probably means he has something better than a 2nd pair. If you get raised after you've bet, fold unless you're absolutely sure it's a loose player drawing.

==== 3rd pair ====

3rd pair is below the middle flop card. Check/fold or make a position bet if it's checked to you and the pair is above the bottom flop card. Do not call any bets or raises. This is a hand where you're hoping to get to the turn for free and get two pair or an unlikely trips. 

=== Split pairs ===

Split pairs are pairs where you have one card in your hand and the other one in the flop. They aren't necessarily worse than pocket pairs, but the kicker is crucial.

==== Top pair ====

Top pair, top kicker (sometimes known as TPTK) is the best split pair possible. If you don't see imminent danger (such as a connected flop), slow-play. Else, bet big and try to force everyone out. The only thing is that you have to make sure you don't get carried away by a leading bettor who has obviously beaten you, but you're still holding on to the TPTK. TPTK is not a miracle hand and definitely not an immediate winner. Any overpair or even two pair is way better and you shouldn't hold on to the old pair to the showdown if you don't improve your hand in the meantime. Beware overpairs if you don't have additional outs in your hand (e.g. straight or flush draw).

==== Middle pair ====

A middle pair is a pair involving the middle flop card. If you get a middle pair, you should either bet or check/fold, depending on the playing conditions. It is a big advantage here to have an ace kicker. With an Ax hand, you can play more freely and usually take a free card when possible, since you want to get two pair, trips or a flush draw. If you get two pair, you can dominate the overcards, if you get trips, you can dominate the other player with the trips by your ace kicker, if you get a flush, your ace will guarantee you a win etc. However, if you have a worse kicker, play less aggressively and don't take much free cards. Should a tight opponent bet, fold.

==== Bottom pair ====

This is the worst split pair. Of course, the advice is to play very passively. If anyone bets, fold. In most cases you'll lose a bottom pair on the showdown, so your goal is to improve. You have only 5 outs to improve. If you decide to bluff and bet with a hand like this, do not make it a costly habit. If you're last to act and the table seems quiet, take a free card.

=== Draws ===

The opposite of made hands, draws are hands where you're aiming at a combination such as a straight or a flush, but you have only 4 cards necessary. You're aiming to get the fifth one either at turn or at river. If you have only 3 cards, you have a backdoor draw. The only feasible backdoor draw is a backdoor flush draw, getting you 1-2 outs. A backdoor straight draw is worthless. A nut draw is a draw to a nut hand.

Draws with 9 or more outs are generally good. Do not call here, make some action. 12 nut outs (ace-flush draw) are usually enough for a 50% turn &amp; river chance, making you an even-money bet against a random opponent. The more opponents you have, the higher your calling odds are. You should remember not to &quot;draw dead&quot; (i.e. when you're drawing to a straight and it seems obvious someone has already got a flush). Also, beware of dead outs (your own outs that also help your opponents).

You should be more careful if you're not drawing to a nut hand. In that case, you could often by showdown find yourself against a better hand, even if you complete your draw. If you have a mid-to-late position and a rather good draw, try to make a middle-sized bet to take the pot outright.

If you have less than 9 outs, the pot odds become the imperative here. Do not call scare bets, you'll be wasting your money.

=== Big overcards ===

Big overcards are strong preflop holdings (AKs, AQs, AK, KQs, AQ, AJs) against a flop with no face cards with no made hand and no 4-card draws in sight. Be careful when playing with these against strong players as they know this is one of your most frequent hands. Sometimes try to pass it off as an overpair, but don't do it too frequently. Don't play this hand against more than two opponents.

=== Other hands ===

Anything not mentioned here is usually not even worth a bluff. Check/fold as you'll usually lose with such bad hands. Playing something like this is OK only on a late stage of a tournament.

== [[/Components of a computer/]] ==

The following sections will introduce various concepts in computer programming.  There are some simplifications in the explanations below.  Don't take anything too literally.

== Programming Languages ==

The purpose of programming is to tell the computer what to do.  Computers are better at doing some things than you are, like a chef is better at cooking than you are.  It's easier to tell a chef to cook you a meal than to cook it yourself.  The more precise you are in your request, the more your meal will turn out how you like it.  In most scenarios like this in real life, small amounts of ambiguity and misinterpretation are acceptable. Perhaps the chef will boil your potato before mashing it instead of baking it.  With computers, however, ambiguity is rarely acceptable.  Programs are so complex that if the computer just guessed at the meaning of ambiguous or vague requests, it might cause problems so subtle that you'd never find them.  Programming languages, therefore, have been designed to accept only completely clear and unambiguous statements.  The program might still have problems, but the blame is then squarely on you, not on the computer's guess.  Much of the difficulty in programming comes from having to be perfectly precise and detailed about everything instead of just giving high-level instructions.

Some languages require total and complete detail about everything.  C and C++ are such languages, and are called '''''low-level languages'''''.  Other languages will make all sorts of assumptions, and this lets the programmer specify less detail.  Python and Basic are such languages, and are called '''''high-level languages'''''.  In general, high-level languages are easier to program but give you less control.  Control is sometimes important, for example if you want your program to run as quickly as possible.  Most of the time total control and speed aren't necessary, and as computers get faster high-level languages become more popular.  Here we will deal exclusively with high-level languages.  Low-level languages are generally similar except there's often more lines of code to write to accomplish the same thing.

== Statements ==

Most programming languages have the concept of a statement.  A '''''statement''''' is a command that the programmer gives to the computer.  For example:

    print &quot;Hi there!&quot;

This command has a verb (&quot;print&quot;) and other details (what to print).  In this case, the command &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;show on the screen,&quot; not &quot;print on the printer.&quot;  The programmer either gives the statement directly to the computer (by typing it while running a special program), or creates a text file with the command in it.  You could create a file called &quot;hi.txt&quot; using a program like Notepad, put the above command in it, and give the file to the computer.  (The details of how to do all this are language- and system-specific, so they won't be covered here.  This is just an introduction to the concepts.)

If you have more than one command in the file, each will be performed in order, top to bottom.  So the file could contain:

    print &quot;Hi there!&quot;
    print &quot;Strange things are afoot...&quot;

The computer will perform each of these commands sequentially.  It's invaluable to be able to &quot;play computer&quot; when programming.  Ask yourself, &quot;If I were the computer, what would I do with these statements?&quot;  If you're not sure what the answer is, then you are very likely to write incorrect programs.  Stop and check the manual for the programming language you're using.

In the above case, the computer will look at the first statement, determine that it's a &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; statement, look at what needs to be printed, and display that text on the computer screen.  It'll look like this:

    Hi there!

Note that the quotation marks aren't there.  Their purpose in the program is to tell the computer where the text begins and ends, just like in English prose.  The computer will then continue to the next statement, perform its command, and the screen will look like this:

    Hi there!
    Strange things are afoot...

When the computer gets to the end of the text file, it stops and waits for further instructions. There are many different kinds of statements, depending on which programming language is being used.  For example, there could be a &lt;tt&gt;beep&lt;/tt&gt; statement that causes the computer to output a beep on its speaker, or a &lt;tt&gt;window&lt;/tt&gt; statement that causes a new window to pop up.

Also, the way statements are written will vary depending on the programming language.  The programming language Python uses statements that look like the above.  In C you would write:

    puts(&quot;Hi there!&quot;);
    puts(&quot;Strange things are afoot...&quot;);

Note a few differences:
# The parameters (the text in quotation marks that &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; uses to determine what to display) are surrounded by parentheses.
# Each statement is terminated by a semicolon.
# The verb &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; is called &lt;tt&gt;puts&lt;/tt&gt;, for &quot;put string&quot;.  The word '''''string''''' is the computer term for some text.  It comes from &quot;a string of letters.&quot;  The &quot;put&quot; means &quot;put on the screen.&quot;
These differences are fairly superficial.  The set of rules like the first two is called a programming language's '''''syntax'''''.  The set of verbs is called its '''''library'''''.

== Syntax ==

All computer languages have syntax, rules to create proper statements, just like natural languages do.  For example, most sentences are ended with a full stop or a period.  Likewise it is common for statements in source code to be ended with a semicolon, but many languages do not have this requirement so it is important to know the syntax of the language you are programming in.  For example, if you wanted the computer to display two different things you could write:

    print &quot;I have a dog.  His name is Bort.&quot;

or you could write:

    print &quot;I have a dog.  &quot; + &quot;His name is Bort.&quot;

The second example has two strings, each enclosed in quotation marks.  There's a plus (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;) sign in between them, which means, &quot;Attach the two strings together, turning them into a single string.&quot;  (Attaching two strings is called '''''concatenation'''''.)  The two above statements will display the same thing:

    I have a dog.  His name is Bort.

In the above examples there's no reason why you'd use a &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; and two strings when you could just use a single string, as in the first example, but below there will be cases where concatenation of strings is necessary.  The languages Python and Java use plus (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;) for string concatenation, Perl and PHP use the period (&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;), and Visual Basic uses ampersand (&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;).  Again, these differences are superficial; what's important is the concept of string concatenation and of language syntax to do things like concatenation.  Separate in your mind an underlying concept and a particular language's way of expressing that concept.

When programs are compiled, or converted into an executable program, they are analyzed by a parser, the equivalent of a proofreader, to determine if the syntax is correct.  Assuming the program's source code is syntactically correct, the compiler will continue to analyze the source code to determine if there are any semantical errors.

Semantics refers to the meaning or logic of a computer program.  Two syntactically correct statements can make perfect sense by themselves, but they may not make sense when placed next to each other.  Sometimes these flaws in logic can be detected by the compiler, what is known as a compile-time error, but typically these errors surface when the program is executed, known as run-time errors.

Observe the following conversation:
 Alice: Terrible news.  Carl's wife was in a car accident.
 Bob: Oh, that is terrible.  Send some nice flowers and get everyone to sign a card.
 Alice: Sure.  Oh, and Dan called in sick again.
 Bob: Not again.  Send him a pink slip.
The conversation makes perfect, logical sense.  This conversation shows a good, consistent use of semantics.

Now observe this conversation:
 Alice: Terrible news.  Carl's wife was in a car accident.
 Bob: Not again.  Send him a pink slip.
 Alice: Sure.  Oh, and Dan called in sick again.
 Bob: Oh, that is terrible.  Send some nice flowers and get everyone to sign a card.
Although this conversation contains the exact same sentences as the previous one, it has a very different meaning.  A human may be able to bend the rules of grammar and structure to determine the intended meaning of a conversation, but computers are not as flexible.  Therefore, it is important to use proper syntax and use good semantics in order to properly convey to the computer what you want it to do.  Understand though, that the first conversation could have been rearranged and still have the same meaning or different sentences could have been used to convey the same idea.  In that sense there can be many different ways to write the same program.

== Variables ==

Say you had a program that talked about your dog.  It might look like this:

    print &quot;I have a dog.  It is called Bort.&quot;
    print &quot;Bort likes to eat dog food.&quot;
    print &quot;My children and Bort get along very well.&quot;
    print &quot;My dog Bort barks at my neighbor, whose name is also Bort.&quot;

You might go on like this for a while, asking the computer to display many such interesting things about your dog.  If, one day, you changed your dog's name, or instead wanted to talk about your other dog, or gave this program to a friend and they wanted to change it to refer to their own dog, you'd have to go through the whole program and change every occurrence of &quot;Bort&quot; to the new name.  You could use your text editor's search-and-replace feature to do this, but doing so is tedious and you might make mistakes.  For example, you might accidentally replace the neighbor's name when you only intended to change the dog's name.

Programming languages solve this problem by allowing you to write the dog's name only once and then refer to it using a label.  This is a bit like using pronouns in natural languages.  So you could write:

    dog = &quot;Bort&quot;

If you're &quot;playing computer&quot; and get to the above statement, you'll think, &quot;Remember the string &quot;Bort&quot;, and whenever the word ''dog'' is used, substitute the word &quot;Bort&quot;.&quot;  This is called an '''''assignment statement''''' because you're assigning meaning to the word ''dog''.  A subsequent statement could say:

    print dog

Note that there are no quotation marks here.  You don't literally want to print the word &quot;dog&quot;, you want the computer to remember the string it had previously associated with that word.  It's a bit like the distinction between saying &quot;He said his age&quot; and &quot;He said, 'his age'.&quot;  In the first case it's a number and in the second it's the words &quot;his age&quot;.  The word ''dog'' is a '''''variable'''''.  It's a symbol that the computer associates with something else, in this case the word &quot;Bort&quot;.  Our original program can now be written as:

    print &quot;I have a dog.  It is called &quot; + dog + &quot;.&quot;
    print dog + &quot; likes to eat dog food.&quot;
    print &quot;My children and &quot; + dog + &quot; get along very well.&quot;
    print &quot;My dog &quot; + dog + &quot; barks at my neighbor, whose name is Bort.&quot;

Note that string concatenation (using the plus sign) was necessary here, since sometimes we wanted to use quotation marks (to mean literal text) and sometimes we didn't (to refer to the variable).  The computer will see a statement like:

    print dog + &quot; likes to eat dog food.&quot;

and first substitute the word ''dog'' with the string &quot;Bort&quot;:

    print &quot;Bort&quot; + &quot; likes to eat dog food.&quot;

then concatenate the strings:

    print &quot;Bort likes to eat dog food.&quot;

then perform the statement, displaying this on the screen:

    Bort likes to eat dog food.

Note also that the name of the neighbor was not replaced by a reference to ''dog''.  The variable ''dog'' refers to the name of the dog.  That's the whole point of using the variable: to keep track of a specific concept.  You could have a different variable to keep track of the neighbor's name:

    neighbor = &quot;Bort&quot;

and change the last line of our program to:

    print &quot;My dog &quot; + dog + &quot; barks at my neighbor, whose name is &quot; + neighbor + &quot;.&quot;

That way you can change the name of your dog or your neighbor easily at the top of the file and the rest of the program will run correctly.  I removed the word &quot;also&quot; from the line since, now that we're using variables, I can no longer be sure that the two names are the same.  I wouldn't want to change one of the two and have my program still display the word &quot;also&quot; there.  Later we'll see a way of displaying the word &quot;also&quot; only if the two names are the same.

It's important to remember two things about variables.  Firstly, a variable must be set before it is used.  So you must write:

    dog = &quot;Bort&quot;
    print dog

and not:

    print dog                             (Wrong!)
    dog = &quot;Bort&quot;

Remember when &quot;playing computer&quot; that you must look at each statement individually and in order from top to bottom.  In the second example above you would first get to the &quot;print dog&quot; statement and have no idea what the variable ''dog'' was referring to.  Different languages react differently when they run into this problem.  Some just assume the variable is an empty string (&quot;&quot;), but most stop the program and report the error.

Secondly, when you're &quot;playing computer&quot; and see the second line of the correct program:

    dog = &quot;Bort&quot;
    print dog

it's very important that you don't &quot;go back up&quot; to the first line to see what ''dog'' refers to.  The first line is long gone.  You can only look at one line at a time, and always sequentially.  The first line makes a note somewhere (in memory) that ''dog'' refers to &quot;Bort&quot;, but then the line itself is left behind and forgotten.  The second line checks memory and gets the variable's meaning there, not from the first line directly.  This may seem like a trivial distinction, but we'll use variables in more sophisticated ways later and it won't work to &quot;go back up&quot; to find where a variable was set; you'll need to think of the variable and its value as being stored in memory.

The word ''variable'' implies that variables can change, and indeed they can.  You could write the following program:

    dog = &quot;Bort&quot;
    print &quot;My first dog was called &quot; + dog + &quot;.&quot;
    dog = &quot;Milou&quot;
    print &quot;And my second dog was called &quot; + dog + &quot;.&quot;

The computer will see the first line, associate the string &quot;Bort&quot; with the variable ''dog'', use that string in the second line, change the association of the variable ''dog'' to &quot;Milou&quot; in the third line, and use the new association in the fourth.  In memory the variable ''dog'' can only be associated with one string.  The third line above replaces the old association with the new.  The second and fourth lines look into memory to see what that association is, and at each statement the value is different because the value in memory is different at that point in the program's execution.  You'll see:

    My first dog was called Bort.
    And my second dog was called Milou.

== Math ==

When the computer sees a mathematical expression, it performs the arithmetic automatically.  For example, you can write:

    print 5 + 6

Note again that there are no quotation marks.  If there were, the computer would take that literally and print &quot;5 + 6&quot;.  The plus sign is called an '''''operator''''' because it performs operations on other values.  When the computer sees the above line, it will perform the arithmetic and get:

    print 11

Executing the statement will just print the number:

    11

Note that the following two statements will display the same thing:

    print 11
    print &quot;11&quot;

except that in the first case the computer knows it's a number, whereas in the second case it's just a string.  Sometimes that distinction matters, but we can ignore it for now.  The math can get pretty complicated:

    print (5 + 12) * 9 / 14

The computer would perform the arithmetic step by step, just like you would in your head.  It would first do the addition, since it's in parentheses:

    print 17 * 9 / 14

Then the multiplication, since it's on the left:

    print 153 / 14

Then the division:

    print 10

And you'd see this if you ran the original line:

    10

Note that 153 divided by 14 is actually something like 10.928, but the computer printed the round number below the real value.  That's because there are two kinds of numbers most languages deal with: integers and reals.  '''''Integers''''' are round numbers, like the ones above.  '''''Reals''''' are numbers with a decimal point, like 10.928.  When the computer sees an expression using entirely integers, it keeps using integers to do the math, even if the result really should be a real.  Had we written:

    print (5.0 + 12.0) * 9.0 / 14.0

then the computer would have performed the math using reals and we would have seen something like this printed:

    10.9285714286

This is a quirky result of the historical development of computers.  It can lead to bizarre results, like this line:

    print 1 / 2

displaying &quot;0&quot; instead of the expected &quot;0.5&quot;.  There are times when the current behavior is desirable, but often it's not and you should keep the distinction between integers and reals in mind.  Also note that the above rules about integers and reals apply to most commonly-used programming languages, but each language is free to make up its own rules for dealing with numbers, and you may one day use a language that does things differently, such as making &quot;1 / 2&quot; result in &quot;0.5&quot;.

Variables can be used to refer to numbers as well as strings.  You could write:

    x = 5
    print x

to print &quot;5&quot;.  Or you could write:

    age = 33
    print age * 2

to find out twice your age.  Again here the first line creates in memory an association between the variable whose name is ''age'' with the number 33.  The second line looks into memory, grabs the number associated with ''age'', and performs the arithmetic.  Note that the first line is not algebra.  It's not an equation that makes ''age'' and the number 33 the same.  It's an ''assignment'' of the value 33 to the variable ''age''.  The distinction is important when you see a line like:

    x = x + 5

The above line is impossible in algebra.  The value of ''x'' cannot be equal to the value of ''x'' plus five.  But in a programming language, the line reads as, &quot;Find the value of the variable ''x'' in memory, add 5 to it, then associate the result with the variable ''x''.&quot;  The fact that ''x'' is used both in the math expression on the right of the equal sign and as the place to store the results is irrelevant.  Its value is used in the math expression ''before'' the result is stored back into the variable.  Here's another example:

    x = 5
    y = x + 2
    print x
    print y

You'll get:

    5
    7

But now if you write:

    x = 5
    y = x + 2
    x = 10
    print x
    print y

You'll get:

    10
    7

Go through each line and &quot;play computer&quot; to convince yourself of why the above would behave this way.  Use a piece of paper to keep track of the ''x'' and ''y'' variables if you need to.  If the above isn't clear, stop and re-read this section or the one on variables.  This is a very common stumbling block for new programmers.

You might have noticed that we use the plus (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;) symbol to mean both &quot;string concatenation&quot; and &quot;numerical addition&quot;.  This is fine and usually clear, but what should the computer do with a statement like this:

    print &quot;5&quot; + 6

Should the numbers 5 and 6 be added to yield 11?  Should the string &quot;5&quot; be concatenated with the string &quot;6&quot; to yield &quot;56&quot;?  Should the computer stop and report an error?  Each language deals with this ambiguity in different ways.  In Python, the above line would be an error.  You'd have to explicitly tell the computer which interpretation you wanted.  In Java the &quot;6&quot; would be turned into a string, resulting in the string &quot;56&quot;.  In Perl, PHP, and Visual Basic the string concatenation operator is not plus, it's period for Perl and PHP and ampersand in Visual Basic, so it's always clear what needs to be done based on which operator is used.

== Conditionals ==

Say we had a simple program that displayed your age:

    age = 25
    print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;

If you ran this program it would display:

    You are 25 years old.

Next year you could change the first line to &quot;age = 26&quot; and the program's output would update appropriately.  In fact you could give this program to anyone and they could modify the first line so that the second line would print the right age.  Once you turned 30 you might want to modify it like this:

    age = 30
    print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;
    print &quot;Your warranty has expired!&quot;

That would work fine, except that if you now gave it to someone who was 25 they would not only have to modify the first line but remember to remove the third line.  But why force a human to remove the third line?  The computer should be able to automatically display or not display the third line depending on the value of ''age''.  We can use an &quot;if&quot; statement to tell the computer to do just that:

    age = 30
    print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;
    if age &amp;gt; 29:
        print &quot;Your warranty has expired!&quot;

Again let's &quot;play computer&quot;: when you get to the third line, you look at the word ''age'', realize it's a variable, and get its value (30) from memory (it was stored there on line 1):

    if 30 &amp;gt; 29:

This line says, &quot;If 30 is greater than 29, perform the statements that are indented.  If not, skip the indented statements.&quot;  Since 30 is greater than 29, the indented statements are performed and the joke is displayed on the screen.  If a friend changes the first line to &quot;age = 25&quot;, the third line will compare 25 to 29, and since 25 is not greater than 29, the fourth line will be skipped.

This is a '''''conditional'''''.  Whether the fourth line is run is conditional on the math expression on the third line.  That expression could be more complex, such as:

    if age &amp;gt;= 40 and age &amp;lt; 50:
        print &quot;You are in your forties.&quot;

The &lt;tt&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; symbol means &quot;greater than or equal to&quot;.  Here the &quot;print&quot; line won't get run unless the age is between 40 and 49.  You can also put more than one indented statement:

    if age &amp;gt;= 50 and age &amp;lt; 60:
        print &quot;You are in your fifties.&quot;
        print &quot;Mid-life crisis yet?&quot;

If the person's age is between 50 and 59, both lines will be displayed; otherwise neither will.  Now notice that if the age of the user is 1, the second line of our original program will display a grammatical error:

    You are 1 years old.

That should be &quot;year&quot;, not &quot;years&quot;.  We can use a conditional to fix this bug:

    age = 25
    if age == 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; year old.&quot;
    if age != 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;

The &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;is equal to&quot;.  There are two equal signs in order to differentiate it from an assignment statement, which uses a single equal sign (as in the first line of our program).  This is related to what we wrote above about computer languages always wanting to be perfectly clear about what's intended.  The &lt;tt&gt;!=&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;not equal to&quot;.  Think of the math symbol of the equal sign with a slash through it, then imagine the exclamation mark being that slash.  Now if you set ''age'' to 1 you'll get this:

    You are 1 year old.

Which is correct.  If the ''age'' is not 1, then the first &quot;print&quot; will be skipped and the second will run, displaying the version of the text with a plural &quot;years&quot;.  It's fairly common to want to do one thing if a condition is true (such as &quot;age == 1&quot;) and another if that condition is not true (&quot;age != 1&quot;).  So computer languages have a shortcut to save you from having to retype a whole &quot;if&quot; statement with the inverse condition.  You simply write this:

    age = 25
    if age == 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; year old.&quot;
    else:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;

That means, &quot;If age is 1, run the first print statement.  If not (else), run the second print statement.&quot;  Again you can have multiple statements in either the first section or the second:

    age = 25
    if age == 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; year old.&quot;
        print &quot;You're an infant!&quot;
    else:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;
        print &quot;You're not an infant.&quot;

Now you can give this program to someone else and they only need to change the first line to get a few lines of accurate text displayed about them.  You can imagine that this can get arbitrarily complex, with very sophisticated conditions being tested.  Consider this:

    age = 25
    if age == 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; year old.&quot;
        print &quot;You're an infant!&quot;
    else:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;
    
        if age &amp;lt; 25:
            print &quot;You're young.&quot;
        else:
            print &quot;You're mature!&quot;

This is called a &quot;nested ''if''&quot;.  The second &quot;if&quot; (the one that compares ''age'' with 25) is ''nested'' (within) the first &quot;if&quot;.  Since it's indented, the second &quot;if&quot; will itself only be run if the first condition (&quot;age == 1&quot;) is not true.  If ''age'' is in fact 1, the first &quot;print&quot; will be run and the entire second section, including the second &quot;if&quot;, will be skipped.  So the program will display only one of &quot;You're an infant!&quot; or &quot;You're young.&quot; or &quot;You're mature!&quot;.  You should &quot;play computer&quot; through this program with various values of ''age'', such as 1, 5, 25, and 30.

Conditionals are extremely useful.  In our example, it would have been possible (though inconvenient) for each person to add or remove &quot;print&quot; statements as they modified the age in the first line, but in reality the value for ''age'' would have come from elsewhere, such as a form or a database, and the program would have to run as-is, unmodified, and display the correct text for any value of ''age'' that it might get.

We can look at conditionals in C, again to show that basic concepts are available in different programming languages with only superficial differences:

    if (age &amp;gt; 29)
        puts(&quot;Your warranty has expired!&quot;);

Note these differences: there are parenthese around the condition; &quot;print&quot; was replaced with &quot;puts&quot;, as before; the text to display is surrounded by parentheses; and there's a terminating semicolon at the end of the &quot;puts&quot; statement.  If you wanted to display more than one line, you'd have to write it like this:

    if (age &amp;gt;= 50 &amp;&amp; age &amp;lt; 60) {
        puts(&quot;You are in your fifties.&quot;);
        puts(&quot;Mid-life crisis yet?&quot;);
    }

Note these two additional differences: the &quot;and&quot; has been replaced with &quot;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&quot; in the condition; and there are braces around the pair of &quot;puts&quot; statements.  In C (and languages derived from C, such as C++, Java, and C#), indentation is ignored, so the &quot;if&quot; statement will assume that only the very next statement will be conditionally run.  If you want more than one statement, you have to group them with braces to tell the language that all of these are conditionally run.  In our Python-like language above, indentation is used to tell which statements are under the control of the &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; lines.

== Input ==

In the above examples, the age was placed right in the source code,
on line 1:

    age = 25

This is called '''''hard-coding''''' the age.  The ''hard'' comes from the
fact that once the program is written that way, the age is always
25.  If the user wants to run the program with a different age,
they need to change the source code.  But that assumes that they
understand programming.  Since most users don't understand programming,
we'd really like to simply ask the user their age so that they
never need to see the source code at all.

We can use a line like this:

    age = input()

To ''input'' something means to put it into the computer.  ''Output''
is the reverse, like the ''print'' statements we've been using.

So our program now looks something like:

    print &quot;What is your age?&quot;
    age = input()
    if age == 1:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; year old.&quot;
    else:
        print &quot;You are &quot; + age + &quot; years old.&quot;

When the user runs the program, instead of immediately seeing
the &quot;You are ...&quot; text, they'll first see this:

    What is your age?

and the system will appear to stop.  The user will then be able
to enter their age, press Enter, and the program will continue
as it did before, with the variable ''age'' set to whatever
number the user entered.

You may be curious about the set of parentheses after the word
''input''.  If you didn't have those, like this:

    age = input

the word ''input'' would look a lot like a variable.  Since computers
always want to be completely clear about what needs to be done, we
add parentheses to mean, &quot;This isn't a variable, it's a command.
Do something clever.&quot;  &lt;tt&gt;input()&lt;/tt&gt; is actually a '''''function'''''.
We'll cover functions later, but for now you can think of them
as bits of code that do interesting things (like getting a number
from the keyboard) and making some value available as a result
(for assignment to ''age'' in this case).  When the computer sees this
line:

    age = input()

It first sees the function &lt;tt&gt;input()&lt;/tt&gt;, does the clever thing
(gets a number from the keyboard), and replaces the function with
the value that it got:

    age = 25

(if the user typed ''25'').  Then the assignment continues as it
did before, storing the value 25 into memory and associating it with
the word ''age''.

== Loops ==

Say we wanted to write a program that asked the user how many times
they wanted a phrase repeated.  (Yes, it really is necessary to have
these silly examples.  More realistic examples are often too complex
to demonstate a single new concept.)

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    if count == 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count == 2:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count == 3:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count == 4:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;

If you run this program, the user will be asked &quot;How many times?&quot; and the
computer will wait for an answer.  The user can then type a number
between 1 and 4 and the phrase &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; will be displayed
that many times.  There are several problems with this program.
Firstly, it can at most handle a count of 4.  If the user wants
it displayed 5 times, the program must be extended to handle that
case.  Secondly, as the number of cases grows, it will be difficult
to make sure that the program is correct.  If you extend it all
the way to, say, 20 times, it's difficult to check using your text
editor that the case for 17 really has 17 lines in it.  Perhaps
you made an error and only cut-and-pasted the line 16 times.  We could
be clever and rewrite it like this:

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    if count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count &amp;gt;= 2:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count &amp;gt;= 3:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
    if count &amp;gt;= 4:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;

This is somewhat tricky, so it's important to follow the logic
carefully, as the computer would.  Let's say ''count'' is 3.
The first &quot;if&quot; statement will check if 3 is greater than or
equal to 1, and since it is, print the first phrase.  The
next &quot;if&quot; will compare count to 2, and print the second phrase.
The same thing will happen when &lt;tt&gt;count &amp;gt;= 3&lt;/tt&gt; is tested,
since 3 is greater than or equal to 3.  But the fourth test
will not work, since 3 is not greater than or equal to 4.
So the fourth phrase will not be displayed.  The phrase will
have been displayed 3 times (once for each of the first three
&quot;if&quot; statements), which is what we wanted since ''count'' is 3.

This new way of writing the program is simpler to verify for
correctness.  We just need to make sure that each number in
successive &quot;if&quot; statements is one more than the previous number.
Since each &quot;if&quot; statement only prints a single line, we don't
risk mis-counting the number of &quot;print&quot; lines as in the first
example.  But it's still somewhat tedious to extend the program
to handle higher values of ''count''.  You have to cut-and-paste
two lines and remember to increase the number in the &quot;if&quot; statement.

We could make that a little easier with this new version:

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    if count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        count = count - 1
    if count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        count = count - 1
    if count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        count = count - 1
    if count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        count = count - 1

Now the program is more complicated, but each &quot;if&quot; statement is
identical.  That makes cutting and pasting much easier&amp;mdash;we can
simply hold down the Ctrl-V key and have a program that handles
very large values of ''count''.  Here's how the new program works.
The first &quot;if&quot; statement, as before, compares ''count'' to 1
and prints the phrase if ''count'' is greater than or equal to 1.
But it also does something else: it decreases the value of
''count'' by one.  This statement:

    count = count - 1

does three things: it finds the value of ''count'' in memory, subtracts
1 from it, and puts the result back into memory, replacing the old
value of ''count''.  So if ''count'' is 3, the ''count'' on the
right side is replaced with its value:

    count = 3 - 1

then the arithmetic is done:

    count = 2

and the new value is stored into memory as before, replacing the 3
that was there.  You may wonder why only the ''count'' on the
right side of the equal sign gets replaced with its value, and
not the left.  Why doesn't the computer replace both words with
the value 3, like this:

    3 = 3 - 1

Obviously this wouldn't be very useful.  The assignment statement
only looks up the existing value of variables when they appear
on the right of the equal (assignment) sign.  The single variable
on the left of the equal sign is used as-is to know what name
to associate with the result of the arithmetic on the right.

So after the first phrase is displayed, ''count'' is decreased
by one, and the next &quot;if&quot; is tested.  It's the same test, comparing
''count'' with 1.  Say that ''count'' is 3 initially.  At
the first &quot;if&quot; we'll see the phrase displayed and ''count'' will become
2.  At the second &quot;if&quot; we'll see the phrase and ''count'' will become
1.  At the third &quot;if&quot; we'll see the phrase and ''count'' will become
0.  At the fourth &quot;if&quot; the test &quot;0 &gt;= 1&quot; will not be true, so the
phrase won't get displayed and ''count'' won't be decreased.  No
matter how many more &quot;if&quot; statements you have after that, the
value of ''count'' will stay 0 and none of the &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt;
statements will run.  You'll see the phrase three times, which is
what we wanted since ''count'' was 3 originally.

Our program now has one final problem: no matter how many times
we cut-and-paste these three lines, the user could always enter
a number that's higher than that.  You could have pasted the
&quot;if&quot; statement 500 times, and if the user enters &quot;510&quot;, your program
will only display the phrase 500 times, once for each &quot;if&quot;.  The
program will end with the variable &quot;count&quot; set to 10, since there are
10 more phrases to go, but the last 10 &quot;if&quot; statements won't be there.

We can fix this last problem with a '''''loop''''', like this:

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    while count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        count = count - 1

That's the entire program.  Specifically, this is a '''''while loop''''',
because there are several different kinds.  We removed all the &quot;if&quot;
statements except one, and replaced the word ''if'' with the word
''while''.  It almost reads like an English sentence: &quot;While
''count'' is greater than or equal to 1, print this phrase and
decrease ''count'' by one.&quot;  Let's &quot;play computer&quot; with ''count''
initially set to 3.  The computer will get to the &quot;while&quot; statement,
compare 3 to 1, see that 3 is greater than or equal to 1, display
the phrase, decrease ''count'' by 1 (to 2), and ''loop'' back up
to the ''while'' statement.  Again the computer will compare ''count''
to 1, and since 2 is greater than or equal to 1, it will print the
statement, decrease count to 1, loop back up, compare ''count'' with 1,
and since 1 is greater than or equal to 1, display the phrase and
decrease the variable ''count'' to zero.  It will then loop back up
to the &quot;while&quot; statement, compare ''count'' to 1, and since 0 is ''not''
greater than or equal to 1, the indented statement will not be
run and the &quot;while&quot; loop will finish, moving on to the statements
that follow.  In this program there are no statements that follow,
so the program will end.  Each time through the loop is called
an '''''iteration'''''.

There are several different types of loops.  Which one to use depends
both on what's available in the programming language you're using and
which makes the most sense for what you're trying to do.  For example,
in the example above, we could print the value of ''count'' in each
iteration, like this:

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    while count &amp;gt;= 1:
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        '''print count'''
        count = count - 1

Running the program would look something like this (if the user
typed &quot;3&quot; when asked):

    How many times?
    '''3'''                     (what the user types in)
    Are we there yet?
    3
    Are we there yet?
    2
    Are we there yet?
    1

The numbers 3, 2, 1 are the values of ''count'' at each iteration.
What if, instead, just wanted to count upwards?  Or what if you
didn't want to modify ''count'', because you wanted to use it
later on in the program?  You could use a '''''for loop''''', like this:

    print &quot;How many times?&quot;
    count = input()
    '''for i = 1 to count:'''
        print &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;
        print count

(''Note:'' So far the language we've used for examples has been
similar to the popular programming language Python.  But Python
has no such ''for'' loop.  The above syntax is based on the
language Basic.)

This ''for'' loop means, &quot;Run the indented statements once for
each value between 1 and ''count'', and set the variable ''i''
to that value.&quot;  If the user enters 3 you'll see this:

    How many times?
    '''3'''                     (what the user types in)
    Are we there yet?
    1
    Are we there yet?
    2
    Are we there yet?
    3

The 1, 2, 3 are the values of ''i'' at each iteration.  Note
that we no longer need to decrease the value of ''count'' in
each iteration.  The computer automatically increases ''i'' by
1 each iteration until it reaches ''count''.  In fact, ''count''
is unchanged after the loop finishes.  This loop:

    for i = 1 to count:
        print i

is essentially identical to this version:

    i = 1
    while i &lt;= count:
        print count
        i = i + 1

The ''for'' loop is generally preferable to ''while'' loops
when you want to cover a range of numbers.  It's shorter and
easier to read.  The ''while'' loop, though, is more flexible
since you're doing all the work yourself.  You could increment
''i'' by 2 at each iteration to see only the odd numbers, or
you could double the value of ''i'' to see all the powers of
two:

    print &quot;What is the maximum?&quot;
    maximum = input()
    i = 1
    while i &lt;= maximum:
        print i
        i = i * 2

    What is the maximum?
    '''128'''                     (what the user types in)
    1
    2
    4
    8
    16
    32
    64
    128

You can't do that with a simple ''for'' loop.  Incidentally, in a ''for'' loop
the starting and ending values (1 and ''count'' in our example) can actually be
any pair of numbers.  You could do:

    for i = 20 to 24:
        print i

to display the values 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24.  The variable ''i''
is used here, but any variable could be used.  ''i'' is a commonly-used
variable for ''for'' loops; it stands for ''index''.  You could
also use a variable name that makes more sense in your particular
context, such as:

    for year = 1992 to 2004:
        print &quot;The year is &quot; + year

Another type of loop is the '''''foreach loop'''''.  That's
similar to the ''for'' loop except that the variable doesn't
just go through a numerical range, it's actually set to each
element in a set of numbers:

    foreach year in [1992, 1996, 2000, 2004]:
        print &quot;The &quot; + year + &quot; Olympic Games.&quot;

That also reads almost like an English sentence: &quot;For each
year in the set 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, print this statement.&quot;
(''Note:'' Python does have such a ''for'' loop, except the
word ''for'' is used instead of ''foreach''.)

There are a few other types of loops, but they're usually
variations on the above three types.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Infinite Sets and Cardinality==
'''The Size of a Finite Set'''

When deciding how large finite sets are, we generally count the number of elements in the set, and say two sets are the same size if they have the same number of elements.  This approach doesn't work too well if the sets are infinite, however, because we can't count the number of elements in an infinite set.

However, there is another way to define when two sets have the same size that works equally well for finite and infinite sets.  We say that two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have the same size if we can define a function &lt;math&gt;f: A\to B&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the following properties:

*&lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; is defined for every &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\forall b\in B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\exists a\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; f(a)=b&lt;/math&gt;.  We say that f is ''onto'' or ''surjective''.
*&lt;math&gt;\forall a_1, a_2\in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(a_1)=f(a_2) \implies a_1=a_2&lt;/math&gt;.  We say that f is ''one-to-one'' or ''injective''.

Functions which satisfy these properties are called ''bijections''.

'''Examples'''

The sets &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{4,5,6\}&lt;/math&gt; both have three elements.  We can define a bijection between them like this: &lt;math&gt;f(1)=6, f(2)=4, f(3)=5&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of all positive integers, &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,...\}&lt;/math&gt; is the same size as the set of nonnegative integers, &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,2,...\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;f(1)=0, f(2)=1&lt;/math&gt;, and more generally &lt;math&gt;f(n)=n-1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exercise'''

Prove that the above function is a bijection.

Often it is difficult to construct an explicit bijection between two sets of the same cardinality, so the following theorem can come in handy:

'''Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem'''

''See proof at [[w:Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem|Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]]''

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are two sets and there exist injective functions &lt;math&gt;f:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:B\to A&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a bijection between &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
There are many ways of defining cardinality, and one method is to use ordinals as a reference. The cardinality of a set can be defined to be the smallest ordinal in one-to-one correspondence with the set. However, when speaking of cardinality, it is common to compare with the set of real numbers etc. when speaking of cardinalities greater than the countable cardinal, so in practice cardinality is thought of as something simply compared between two sets. One reason for this is because the possible sizes of ordinals can generally depend on the axioms one is working with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In general, robots are classified based on their capabilities.
Some standard classifications of robots include their [[#Domain of operation|domain of operation]], [[#Degree of autonomy|degree of autonomy]], and the [[#Goal|goal]] they are designed to fulfill.

===Domain of Operation===
Robots can be designed and built for any environment imaginable.
One popular way of classifying robots is by what environments they're designed to operate in.
Some typical examples include:
; Stationary
: These robots are fixed in one place and cannot move.  This category includes robotic [[/Arms|arms]], computerized machine tools, and most other Industrial Robots.
: Industrial Robots are robots used in mass production e.g. welding robots, CNC plate cutters or CNC drills. The large majority of these robots are stationary and tethered to a computer.
; Ground
: These robots are designed to operate on the surface of the earth or other planet, and are usually sub categorized by their drive train:
;*[[/Wheeled|Wheels]]
;*[[/Tracked|Tracks]]
;*[[/Walkers|Legs]]
; Underwater
: Also known as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, these are designed to operate underwater, possibly at great depth.
; Aerial
: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are various kinds of robotic flying machines, including planes and helicopters.
; Microgravity
: Robots that have been designed to operate in low-gravity environments, such as earth orbit.
; other specific [[Robotics/Exotic Robots/Hazardous Environment Robots|Hazardous Environments]]

===Degree of Autonomy===
'''Autonomy''' is the quality of being self-controlled.
One measure of autonomy is the amount of human control that is required for the robot's operation.  An autonomous robot can operate properly without intervention indefinitely and can deal with unexpected problems gracefully.
Teleoperated robots constantly require humans to send the robot control signals.
These are only the endpoints; there is a continuum of possibilities between them.

A robot can also be classified by how self-contained it is.
Power, logic circuitry, and other things may be located either on the main chassis or connected via a cable tether or wireless link from another location.

===Goal===
Robots are also routinely categorized by the goals they are designed to achieve.  These include [[/Contest Robot|contests]], personal enrichment, manufacturing, and [[/Entertainment Robot|entertainment]].

([http://robots.net/rcfaq.html Here's] a list of different contests)
===Fire fighter===

In a fire fighter contest the robot has to find the flame of a candle and extinguish it.

See [http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot/ this site] for an example.

===Maze or obstacle course navigator===

====Maze====
Find the way through the maze as fast as possible.

For example: [http://imd.eng.kagawa-u.ac.jp/maze/index_j.html see this site.]

====Obstacle Course====
There are many different obstacle course to build for a robot contest.
The Melexis Safety Trophy has tin cans with small candles inside and concrete bricks as obstacles and tennis balls (which the robot had to touch) for extra points.
Another contest uses traffic signs with arrows to direct the way.

See [http://www.trophy.melexis.com/en/home.htm this site] for an example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These are robots that have no real ''useful'' application. They're build for fun and practice but little else more. Most homebuilt robots would fall in this category.

They can be simple robots that use simple sensors (light sensor, sound, bumper switches) and have simple behavior, but they could as well have complex sensors and extensive programming.

One other category of robots that's very close related to this category are robot build as &quot;tech-demos&quot;. For example the Asimo robot.

For basic electronics you may want to consult [[Electronics|this wikibook]] and [[Robotics: Computer Control: The Interface: Microcontrollers|this section]] on Microcontrollers.

[http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=making+Pcb%27s+at+home&amp;btnG=Google+zoeken&amp;meta= google] has some links on PCB fabrication.

== Special Electronic Components ==
There are many electronic components that aren't described in most electronic textbooks, but are very useful in robotics. Most of these components are covered in other section in this book (e.g Sensors and Motors).

A typical robot needs a [[Power Electronics#heatsink|heat sink]] on the power transistors connected to its motors and other [[Robotics/Components/Actuation Devices|actuators]], but often does not need a heatsink connected to its CPU.

{{Ada/Navigation|Types|record}}
__TOC__
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A '''record''' is a [[ada Programming/Types#List of types|composite type]] that groups one or more fields. A field can be of any type, even a record.

== Basic record ==

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Basic_Record {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        A : Integer;
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

== Null record ==

The null record is when a type without data is needed. There are two ways to declare a null record:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Null_Record {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       {{Ada/kw|null}};
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}}; 

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Null_Record {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

For the compiler they are the same. However, programmers often use the first variant if the type is not finished yet to show that they are planning to expand the type later, or they usually use the second if the (tagged) record is a base class in object oriented programming.

== Record Values ==

Values of a record type can be specified using a record aggregate, giving a list of named components thus

   A_Basic_Record       {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Basic_Record         {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} Basic_Record{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/delimiter|(}}A {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   Another_Basic_Record {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Basic_Record         {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}A {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 42{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   Nix                  {{Ada/delimiter|:}} {{Ada/keyword|constant}} Null_Record {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}{{Ada/keyword|null}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Given a somewhat larger record type,

   {{Ada/keyword|type}} Car {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}
      Identity       {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Long_Long_Integer{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      Number_Wheels  {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Positive {{Ada/keyword|range}} 1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      Paint          {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Color{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      Horse_Power_kW {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Float {{Ada/keyword|range}} 0{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 2_000{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      Consumption    {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Float {{Ada/keyword|range}} 0{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 100{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|end}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

a value ''may'' be specified using ''positional'' notation, that is, specifying a value for each record component in declaration order

   BMW {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Car {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}2007_752_83992434{{Ada/delimiter|,}} 5{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Blue{{Ada/delimiter|,}} 190{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|,}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}1{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

However, naming the components of a &lt;tt&gt;Car&lt;/tt&gt; aggregate offers a number of advantages.
# Easy identification of which value is used for which component. (After all, named components are the raison d'être of records.)
# Reordering the components is allowed—you only have to remember the component names, not their position.
# Improved compiler diagnostic messages.

Reordering components is possible because component names will inform the compiler (and the human reader!) of the intended value associations.
Improved compiler messages are also in consequence of this additional information passed to the compiler.
While an omitted component will always be reported due to Ada's [http://www.adacore.com/2007/05/14/gem-1/ coverage rules],
messages can be much more specific when there are named associations. 
Considering the &lt;tt&gt;Car&lt;/tt&gt; type from above, suppose a
programmer by mistake specifies only one of the two floating point values for &lt;tt&gt;BMW&lt;/tt&gt; in positional notation.
The compiler, in search of another component value,
will then not be able to decide whether the specified value is intended for &lt;tt&gt;Horse_Power_kW&lt;/tt&gt;
or for &lt;tt&gt;Consumption&lt;/tt&gt;.
If the programmer instead uses named association, say 
Horse_Power_kW {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 190{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
it will be clear which other component is missing.

   BMW {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Car {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}}
     {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Identity       {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 2007_752_83992434{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
      Number_Wheels  {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 5{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
      Horse_Power_kW {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 190{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
      Consumption    {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} 10{{Ada/delimiter|.}}1{{Ada/delimiter|,}}
      Paint          {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}} Blue{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

In order to access a component of a record instance, use the dot delimiter ({{Ada/delimiter|.}}), as in &lt;tt&gt;BMW{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Number_Wheels&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Discriminated record ==

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Discriminated_Record (Size : Natural) {{Ada/kw|is}} 
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        A : String (1 .. Size);
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

== Variant record ==

The variant record is a special type of discriminated record where the presence of some components depend on the value of the discriminant.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Yellow, Green);
 
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Variant_Record (Option : Traffic_Light) {{Ada/kw|is}} 
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        {{Ada/--|common components}}
        
        {{Ada/kw|case}} Option {{Ada/kw|is}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Red =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for red}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Yellow =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for yellow}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Green =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for green}}
        {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

=== Mutable and immutable variant records ===

You can declare variant record types such that its discriminant, and thus its variant structure, can be changed during the lifetime of the variable.  Such a record is said to be ''mutable''.  When &quot;mutating&quot; a record, you must assign '''all''' components of the variant structure which you are mutating at once, replacing the record with a complete variant structure.  Although a variant record declaration may allow objects of its type to be mutable, there are certain restrictions on whether the objects will be mutable.  Reasons restricting an object from being mutable include:

* the object is declared with a discriminant (see Immutable_Traffic_Light below)
* the object is aliased (either by use of {{Ada/kw|aliased}} in the object declaration, or by allocation on the heap using {{Ada/kw|new}})


  {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Yellow, Green);
 
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Mutable_Variant_Record (Option : Traffic_Light := Red) {{Ada/kw|is}}      {{Ada/--|the discriminant must have a default value}}
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        {{Ada/--|common components}}
        Location : Natural;
        {{Ada/kw|case}} Option {{Ada/kw|is}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Red =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for red}}
              Flashing : Boolean := True;
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Yellow =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for yellow}}
              Timeout    : Duration := 0.0;
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Green =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for green}}
              Whatever : Positive := 1;
        {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 ...
 Mutable_Traffic_Light   : Mutable_Variant_Record;                    {{Ada/--|not declaring a discriminant makes this record mutable}}
                                                                      {{Ada/--|it has the default discriminant/variant}}
                                                                      {{Ada/--|structure and values}}
 
 Immutable_Traffic_Light : Mutable_Variant_Record (Option =&gt; Yellow); {{Ada/--|this record is immutable, the discriminant cannot be changed}}
                                                                      {{Ada/--|even though the type declaration allows for mutable objects}}
                                                                      {{Ada/--|with different discriminant values}}
 ...
 Mutable_Traffic_Light   := (Option =&gt; Yellow,                        {{Ada/--|mutation requires assignment of all components}}
                             Location =&gt; 54,                          {{Ada/--|for the given variant structure}}
                             Timeout =&gt; 2.3);
 ...
 {{Ada/--|restrictions on objects, causing them to be immutable}}
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Mutable_Variant_Record;
 Any_Traffic_Light       : Traffic_Light_Access :=
                            {{Ada/kw|new}} Mutable_Variant_Record;
 Aliased_Traffic_Light   : {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Mutable_Variant_Record;


Conversely, you can declare record types so that the discriminant along with the structure of the variant record may not be changed.  To make a record type declaration ''immutable'', the discriminant must '''not''' have a default value.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Yellow, Green);
 
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Immutable_Variant_Record (Option : Traffic_Light) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/--|no default value makes the record type immutable}}
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        {{Ada/--|common components}}
        Location : Natural := 0;
        {{Ada/kw|case}} Option {{Ada/kw|is}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Red =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for red}}
              Flashing : Boolean := True;
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Yellow =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for yellow}}
              Timeout    : Duration;
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Green =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for green}}
              Whatever : Positive := 1;
        {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 ...
 Default_Traffic_Light   : Immutable_Variant_Record;                    {{Ada/--|ILLEGAL!}}
 Immutable_Traffic_Light : Immutable_Variant_Record (Option =&gt; Yellow); {{Ada/--|this record is immutable, since the type declaration is immutable}}

== Union ==

{{Ada/2005|Record}}

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Traffic_Light {{Ada/kw|is}} (Red, Yellow, Green);
 
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Union (Option : Traffic_Light := Traffic_Light'First) {{Ada/kw|is}} 
     {{Ada/kw|record}}
        {{Ada/--|common components}}
        
        {{Ada/kw|case}} Option {{Ada/kw|is}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Red =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for red}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Yellow =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for yellow}}
           {{Ada/kw|when}} Green =&gt;
              {{Ada/--|components for green}}
        {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|case}};
     {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
  {{Ada/pragma|Unchecked_Union}} (Union);
  {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (C, Union);    {{Ada/--|optional}}

The difference to a variant record is such that &lt;var&gt;Option&lt;/var&gt; is not actually stored inside the record and never checked for correctness - it's just a dummy.

This kind of record is usually used for interfacing with C but can be used for other purposes as well (then without &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (C, Union);&lt;/code&gt;).

== Tagged record ==

The tagged record is one part of what in other languages is called a class. It is the basic foundation of [[ada Programming/Object Orientation|object orientated programming in Ada]]. The other two parts a class in Ada needs is a [[ada Programming/Object Orientation#The_package|package]] and [[ada Programming/Object Orientation#Primitive_operations|primitive operations]].

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} 
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       Name   : String (1 .. 10);
       Gender : Gender_Type;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person {{Ada/kw|with}}
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       Skilled_In : Language_List;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

Ada 2005 only:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person 
                    {{Ada/kw|and}} Printable 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} 
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       Skilled_In : Language_List;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

== Abstract tagged record ==

An abstract type has at least an abstract primitive operation, i.e. one of its operations is not defined and then its derivative types has to provide an implementation.

== With aliased elements ==

If you come from [[C Programming|C]]/[[C++ Programming|C++]], you are probably used to the fact that every element of a record - which is not part of a bitset - has an address. In Ada, this is not true because records, just like arrays, can be packed. And just like arrays you can use {{Ada/kw|aliased}} to ensure that an element can be accessed via an access type.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Basic_Record {{Ada/kw|is}} 
    {{Ada/kw|record}}
       A : {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Integer;
    {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}} ;

Please note: each element needs its own {{Ada/kw|aliased}}.

== Limited Records ==

In addition to being variant, tagged, and abstract,
records may also be limited (no assignment, and no predefined
equality operation for [[Ada_Programming/Types/limited|Limited Types]]).
In object oriented programming, when tagged objects are
handled by references instead of copying them, this blends
well with making objects limited.

==C Structure and Style==
This is a basic introduction to good code style in the C Programming Language. It is designed to provide information on how to effectively use indentation, comments, and other elements that will make your C code more readable. It is not a tutorial on actually programming in C.

As a beginning programmer, the point of creating structure in the programs' code might not be clear, as the compiler doesn't care about the difference. However, as programs become complex, chances are that writing the program has become a joint effort. (Or others might want to see how it was accomplished.) Therefore, the code is no longer designed purely for a compiler to read.

In the following sections, we will attempt to explain good programming practices that will in turn make your programs clearer and more effective.

== Introduction ==
In C, programs are composed of statements. These statements are terminated with a semi-colon, and are collected in sections known as functions.  By convention, a statement should be kept on its own line, as shown in the example below: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  
 int main(void)
 {
 	printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);
 	return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The following block of code is essentially the same: while it contains exactly the same code, and will compile and execute with the same result, the removal of spacing causes an essential difference, making it harder to read:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int main(void) {printf(&quot;Hello, World!\n&quot;);return 0;}
&lt;/source&gt;

The simple use of indents and line breaks can greatly improve the readability of the code; without making any impact whatsoever on how the code performs. By having readable code, it is much easier to see where functions and procedures end, and which lines are part of which loops and procedures.

This book is going to focus on the above piece of code, and how to improve it.  Please note that during the course of the tutorial, there will be many (apparently) redundant pieces of code added.  These are only added to provide examples of techniques that we will be explaining, without breaking the overall flow of code that the program achieves.

== Line Breaks and Indentation ==
The addition of white space inside your code is arguably the most important part of good code structure.  Effective use of white space can create a visual scale of how your code flows, which can be very important when returning to your code when you want to maintain it.

=== Line Breaks ===
{{Warning|Note that we have used line numbers here; they are not a part of the actual code.  They are only there for reference in this book.}}
With minimal line breaks, code is barely readable by humans, and may be hard to debug or understand:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; line&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void){ int i=0; printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++){ printf(&quot;\n&quot;); break; } return 0; }
&lt;/source&gt;

Rather than putting everything on one line, it is much more readable to break up long lines so that each statement and declaration goes on its own line.  After inserting line breaks, the code will look like this: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; line&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void)
{
int i=0;
printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); 
for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++)
{ 
printf(&quot;\n&quot;); 
break;
}
return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Blank Lines ===

Blank lines should be used to offset the main components of your code.  Use them 
*After precompiler declarations.
*After new variables are declared.

Based on these two rules, there should now be two line breaks added.
*After line 1, because line 1 has a preprocessor directive
*After line 5, because line 5 contains a variable declaration
This will make the code much more readable than it was before:

The following lines of code have line breaks between functions, but without indentation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; line&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
int i=0;

printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++)
{
printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
break;
}
return 0;
}
 
&lt;/source&gt;
  
But this still isn't as readable as it can be.

=== Indentation ===

{{Side note|side=right|&lt;small&gt;Many text editors automatically indent appropriately when you hit the enter/return key.&lt;/small&gt;}}
Although adding simple line breaks between key blocks of code can make code  easier to read, it provides no information about the block structure of the program.  Using the tab key can be very helpful now: indentation visually separates paths of execution by moving their starting points to a new column in the line.  This simple practice will make it much easier to read and understand code.  Indentation follows a fairly simple rule:

*All code inside a new block should be indented by one tab&lt;ref&gt;

Several programmers recommend &quot;use spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs in your code. You should set your editor to emit spaces when you hit the tab key.&quot; [http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml] [http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html]  

Other programmers disagree. [http://web.archive.org/20080118165124/diagrammes-modernes.blogspot.com/2006/04/tab-versus-spaces.html] [http://www.derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html]

Regardless of whether you prefer spaces or tabs, make sure you keep it consistent with projects you are working on, because mixing tabs and spaces can cause code to become unreadable.
&lt;/ref&gt; more than the code in the previous path.

Based on the code from the previous section, there are two blocks requiring indentation:

*Lines 5 to 13
*Lines 10 and 11

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot; line&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) 
{
    int i=0;

    printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
    for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++)
    {
        printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
        break;
    }
    return 0;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

It is now fairly obvious as to which parts of the program fit inside which blocks.  You can tell which parts of the program the coder has intended to loop, and which ones he or she has not.  Although it might not be immediately noticeable, once many nested loops and paths get added to the structure of the program, the use of indentation can be very important.  This indentation makes the structure of your program clear. 

Indentation was originally one tab character, or the equivalent of 8 spaces.  Research since the original indent size has shown that indents between 2 to 4 characters are easier to read&lt;ref name=&quot;rice&quot;&gt;http://www.oualline.com/vim/vim-cook.html#drawing Vim cookbook&lt;/ref&gt;, resulting in such tab sizes being used as default in modern IDEs. However, an indent of 8 characters may still be in use for some systems&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxkernel&quot;&gt;https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle Linux Kernel Coding Style&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Comments ==

Comments in code can be useful for a variety of purposes.  They provide the easiest way to set off specific parts of code (and their purpose); as well as providing a visual &quot;split&quot; between various parts of your code.  Having good comments throughout your code will make it much easier to remember what specific parts of your code do.

Comments in modern flavors of C (and many other languages) can come in two forms:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;//Single Line Comments  (added by C99 standard, famously known as c++ style of comments)&lt;/source&gt;
and
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*Multi-Line
Comments*/ (only form of comments supported by C89 standard)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that Single line comments are a fairly recent addition to C, so some compilers may not support them.  A recent version of [[Wikipedia:GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] will have no problems supporting them.

This section is going to focus on the various uses of each form of commentary.

=== Single-line Comments ===

Single-line comments are most useful for simple 'side' notes that explain what certain parts of the code do.  The best places to put these comments are next to variable declarations, and next to pieces of code that may need explanation.

Based on our previous program, there are two good places to place comments
*Line 5, to explain what 'int i' is going to do
*Line 11, to explain why there is a 'break' keyword.

This will make our program look something like

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {

    int i=0;                // loop variable.

    printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
 
    for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++) {
        printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
        break;               //Exits 'for' loop.
    }
    
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Multi-line Comments ===

{{Side note|side=right|&lt;small&gt;Single-line comments are a new feature, so many C programmers only use multi-line comments.&lt;/small&gt;}}
Multi-line comments are most useful for long explanations of code.  They can be used as copyright/licensing notices, and they can also be used to explain the purpose of a block of code.  This can be useful for two reasons: They make your functions easier to understand, and they make it easier to spot errors in code.  If you know what a block is ''supposed'' to do, then it is much easier to find the piece of code that is responsible if an error occurs.

As an example, suppose we had a program that was designed to print &quot;Hello, World! &quot; a certain number of lines, a specified number of times.  There would be many for loops in this program.  For this example, we shall call the number of lines ''i'', and the number of strings per line as ''j''.

A good example of a multi-line comment that describes 'for' loop ''i'''s purpose would be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* For Loop (int i)
    Loops the following procedure i times (for number of lines).  Performs 'for' loop j on each loop,
    and prints a new line at end of each loop.
 */
&lt;/source&gt;

This provides a good explanation of what ''i'''s purpose is, whilst not going into detail of what ''j'' does.  By going into detail over what the specific path does (and not ones inside it), it will be easier to troubleshoot the path.

Similarly, you should always include a multi-line comment before each function, to explain the role, preconditions and postconditions of each function.    Always leave the technical details to the individual blocks inside your program - this makes it easier to troubleshoot.

A function descriptor should look something like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /* Function : int hworld (int i,int j)
    Input    : int i (Number of lines), int j (Number of instances per line)
    Output   : 0 (on success)
    Procedure: Prints &quot;Hello, World!&quot; j times, and a new line to standard output over i lines.
 */
&lt;/source&gt;
This system allows for an at-a-glance explanation of what the function should do.  You can then go into detail over how each aspect of the program is achieved later on in the program.

Finally, if you like to have aesthetically-pleasing source code, the multi-line comment system allows for the easy addition of comment  boxes.  These make the comments stand out much more than they would without otherwise.  They look like this.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /***************************************
  *  This is a multi line comment
  *  That is nearly surrounded by a
  *  Cool, starry border!
  ***************************************/
&lt;/source&gt;

Applied to our original program, we can now include a much more descriptive and readable source code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    /************************************************************************************
     * Function: int main(void)
     * Input   : none
     * Output  : Returns 0 on success
     * Procedure: Prints &quot;Hello, World!&quot; and a new line to standard output then exits.
     ************************************************************************************/
    int i=0;                //Temporary variable used for 'for' loop.
 
    printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
 
    /* FOR LOOP (int i)
       Prints a new line to standard output, and exits */
    for (i=0; i&lt;1; i++)
    {
        printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
        break;               //Exits 'for' loop.
    }
    
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This will allow any outside users of the program an easy way to comprehend what the code functions are and how they operate.  It also inhibits uncertainty with other like-named functions.

A few programmers add a column of stars on the right side of a block comment:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 /***************************************
  *  This is a multi line comment       *
  *  that is completely surrounded by a *
  *  cool, starry border!               *
  ***************************************/
&lt;/source&gt;
But most programmers don't put any stars on the right side of a block comment.
They feel that aligning the right side is a waste of time.

Comments written in source files can be used for documenting source code automatically by using popular tools like Doxygen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macadamian.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=37 &quot;Coding Conventions for C++ and Java&quot;] &quot;all the block comments illustrated in this document have no pretty stars on the right side of the block comment. This deliberate choice was made because aligning those pretty stars is a large waste of time and discourages the maintenance of in-line comments.&quot;,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[c2:BigBlocksOfAsterisks]],[http://books.google.com/books?id=i4zCzpkrt4sC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=programming+comment+block+waste+time+lining+up&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TUpTMIHBnh&amp;sig=NeZm23WPmvnw2aKMnIRUeQoHmJg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pri3SevGIYGyNMn9jd4K&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result &quot;Code craft&quot;] by Pete Goodliffe page 82,[http://www.falvotech.com/content/publications/conventions/c/ Falvotech &quot;C Programming Style Guide&quot;],

'''Typography'''. The art and professional practice of communication in visual language.

==Introduction==
Broadly typography consists of the choice and application of:
*[[/Fonts/]], the software used to generate typefaces.
*[[/Typefaces/]], their style size and weight.
*[[/Spacing/]] of these letterforms, in words, paragraphs and lines.
*[[/Arrangement/]] of these blocks of information appropriately for the media on which they are to be distributed and read.
Typography can be broadly divided into:
*'''Display typography''' which aims to communicate visually as well as literally. It is often allusive and evocative in its visual form as well as the strict meaning of the language used. The history and associations of particular letterforms are carefully chosen to reinforce the message. Letter forms can be considered to be comparable to different ‘tones of voice’ or the full range of dramatic forms of speech.
**Examples include: Advertising Hoardings, Posters, Book Jackets.
*'''Text typography''' is primarily for continuous reading. It aims to unobtrusively convey the intentions of the author with as little informational ‘noise’ as possible. Letterforms or typefaces for continuous reading tend to be relatively conservative and displayed in a range of layout conventions appropriate to their use, to aid readability. There is often a complex heirarchy of information design to ensure that the relative importance of elements and optimal flow of information is implicit in the design.
**Examples include: Book and magazine design. Fiction and non-fiction texts.
*Website design is currently an interesting mixture of the two approaches, with the addition of new means of user interaction and animation.
*Typography also includes the highly specialised field of [[Typography/Type Design|type design]] but excludes the autographic craft traditions of lettering and calligraphy which are usually not considered part of this discipline unless they result in a full [[/Fonts|font]] or reusable [[/Typefaces/|typeface]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word processor analogy is a bit, hard for a beginner to grasp here. I understand it, but a new programmer may not, or at the very least will likely have a hard time understanding the relationship. In &quot;''Programming in Objective-C''&quot; by Stephen G. Kochan he uses a car analogy. Might we strive for something a little easier and more simple to understand. 

A car is developed from a blue print, or a concept car. Each car that you can buy is an instance of this blue print or concept car. Each instance of this car is an '''Object''' Something along those lines?

Or possibly we can relate it to the human body which most people who can read out to understand at this point in their lives. 

The human body is an object. The human body is created from a blueprint (our genes). Each person is an &quot;instance&quot; of the human body. I can see this might be more difficult, but I'd almost try to find something like a Car or what have you that you can then break down, a car has an engine, a gas tank, a stereo, etc. This way the example can be used again when describing inheritance later on.</text>

'''Choucroute Garnie''' Sauerkraut with sausages, salt pork and potatoes.

Being a little picky about your ingredients (especially the sauerkraut) with this recipe makes all the difference.

==Ingredients==
*1 or so [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] of [[Cookbook:Duck|duck]] [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely chopped
*2 or 3 small [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*5 [[Cookbook:Juniper Berry|juniper berries]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Clove|clove]]
*1 or 2 [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] cloves
*1 or so tablespoons of [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seed]]
*1/2 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Mustard|black mustard seed]]
*2 strips of [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], sliced (or the same amount of salted [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] belly) into rough squares
*1 pound of [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]]
*4 pork [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausages]]
*3 smoked pork slices, bone in
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240ml) or so of [[Cookbook:White Wine|white wine]] (dry)

==Procedure==
#In a [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pot]] large enough to in the end hold everything, melt the duck fat over medium heat.
#When hot, add the onions and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until translucent (about five minutes or so).
#Then, add the sauerkraut, white wine, juniper berries, clove, coriander seed, mustard seed, and garlic.

Color is fundamental to many forms of art.  Its relevance, use and function in a given work depend on the medium of that work.  While some concepts dealing with color are broadly applicable across media, others are not.

The full spectrum of colors is contained in white light. Humans perceive colors from the light reflected off objects. A red object, for example, looks red because it reflects the red part of the spectrum. It would be a different color under a different light.

Light can be split up into a spectrum by sending it through a prism. This was discovered by Isaac Newton, who is the creator of color theory.

==Color Theory==
The study of color in art and design often starts with ''color theory''. Color theory splits up colors into three categories: primaries, secondaries, and tertiaries.

The basic tool used is a color wheel, developed by Isaac Newton in 1666. Another model, the color tree, was created by Albert Munsell. It has a spectrum made up of sets of tints and shades on connected planes.

===Theory Variations===
There are a number of approaches to organizing colors into meaningful relationships.  Most systems differ in structure only.  Among these, three systems are consistently used in the contemporary art world.

====Traditional Model==== 
Traditional color theory is a qualitative attempt to organize colors and their relationships.  It is based on Newton's color wheel, and continues to be the most common system used by painters and printmakers.
[[image:BYR color wheel.svg|right|thumb|A color wheel]]

:'''Traditional color theory''' uses the same principles as subtractive color mixing (see below) but prefers different primary colors.  

:* The Primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These are the &quot;elemental&quot; colors, because they cannot be produced by mixing other colors together, and all other colors are derived from some combination of these three.

:* The Secondary colors are orange (mix of red and yellow), green (mix of blue and yellow), and purple (mix of blue and red).

:* The Tertiary colors are obtained by mixing one primary color and one secondary color. Depending on amount of color used, different hues can be obtained such as red-orange or yellow-green. Neutrals (browns and grays) can be made by mixing all three primaries together.

:* White and black lie outside of these categories. They are used to lighten or darken a color. A lighter color (made by adding white to it) is called a ''tint'', while a darker color (made by adding black) is called a ''shade''.

====Color Mixing==== 
A more quantifiable approach to color theory is to think about color as the result of light reflecting off a surface.  Understood in this way, color can be represented as a ratio of amounts of primary color mixed together.  In this system, primary colors are chosen by dividing up the visible spectrum into thirds and making each third a primary.

Whether a color is being determined by the light source being reflected or the surface reflecting it makes a significant difference in the way colors interact with one another.  This distinction is blurred when working with digital technology where production environments and product often move fluidly between these media types.

:'''Additive color theory''' is used when different colored lights are being projected on top of each other.  Projected media produce color by projecting light onto a reflective surface.  Where subtractive mixing creates the impression of color by selectively absorbing part of the spectrum, additive mixing produces color by selective projection of part of the spectrum.  Common applications of additive color theory are theater lighting and television screens.  RGB color is based on additive color theory.
 
:* The Primary colors are red, blue, and green.

:* The Secondary colors are yellow (mix of red and green), cyan (mix of blue and green), and magenta (mix of blue and red).

:* The Tertiary colors are obtained by mixing the above colors at different intensities.

:* White is created by mixing the three primary colors while black represents the absence of all colors.  The lightness or darkness of a color is determined by the intensity/density of its various parts.  For instance: a middle-toned gray could be produced by projecting a red, a blue and a green light at the same point with 50% intensity.

:'''Subtractive color theory''' (&quot;process color&quot;) is used when a single light source is being reflected by different colors laid one on top of the other.  Color is produced when parts of the external light source's spectrum are absorbed by the material and not reflected back to the viewer's eye.  Subtractive color works as the reverse of additive color theory.  Common applications of subtractive color theory are color printing and photographic positives and negatives. The CMYK color model uses subtractive color theory. It was developed by Herbert Ives for printing.
 
:* The Primary colors are yellow, cyan, and magenta.

:* The Secondary colors are red (mix of magenta and yellow), blue (mix of cyan and magenta), and green (mix of cyan and yellow).

:* The Tertiary colors are obtained by mixing the above colors at different intensities.

:* Black is created by mixing the three primary colors while white represents the absence of all colors. (However, since it is impossible to mix a perfect black, devices using process colors add black as a fourth &quot;color.&quot; CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK.) Similar to additive color theory, lightness/darkness is determined by color intensity/density.

===Color Interactions===
Beyond creating a mixing hierarchy, color theory also provides tools for understanding how colors work together.

====Analogous Colors==== 
[[image:Aura_in_trees.jpg|right|thumb|450px]] Analogous colors are similar to one another.  As their name implies, analogous colors can be found next to one another on any 12 part color wheel.

:'''Common analogous colors''' can be found by taking one tertiary color and one of the secondary colors used by it when creating that tertiary color.  ''note: examples using traditional color theory''

:* purple/blue-purple.

:* green/yellow-green.

:* orange/red-orange.

A '''warm/cool''' scheme uses two pairs of analogous colors; one warm pair and one cool pair. (Intermixing should only be done within the pairs.)

====Complementary Colors==== 
Complementary colors are pairs of colors which, if added, would produce complete color saturation—white or black depending on the type of mixing you're doing.  Complementary colors are found directly opposite one another on a color wheel.

:'''Common complementary colors''' can be found by taking one secondary color and the primary color not used when creating that secondary color.  ''note: examples using traditional color theory''

:* violet/yellow.

:* green/red.

:* orange/blue.

:* white/black.  Though they are not represented on the color wheel, adding white to black will always result in complete color saturation regardless of mixing method.

A '''double complementary''' scheme is made up of two complementary color pairs. (Intermixing may be done, but only within the pairs.)

A '''split complementary''' uses three hues, one color, and two others which are on each side of that hue's complement on the color wheel.

===Attributes===
The three attributes of color are hue, saturation, and value.

====Hue====
A '''hue''' is a pure, spectral color. Black and white are not hues.

====Values====
Color values range from low key (very dark) to high key (very light). 1 is absolute black, and 10 is pure white. Yellow is the hue with the lightest value, while violet is the darkest.

The value of a color can make a difference in how it is perceived. A color on a dark background will appear lighter, while that same color on a light background will appear darker.

===Other Considerations===
Other factors that affect how a piece looks are perception, and local color. Under what conditions will the piece be viewed? Since most art and design is looked at under ordinary (white) light, designers often buy bulbs that recreate that light.

Color quality is another concern. This can be affected by opacity or texture of media, or glossiness of surface.
====Color Subtraction====
A visual phenomenon where the appearance of one color will lessen its presence in a nearby color. For instance, orange (red + yellow) on a red background will appear more like yellow (RY − R = Y).

====Simultaneous Contrast====
Neutrals on a colored background will appear tinted toward that color's complement, because the eye attempts to create a balance. (Grey on a red background will appear more greenish, for example.) In other words, the color will shift ''away'' from the surrounding color.

Also, non-dominant colors will appear tinted towards the complement of the dominant color.

Color interaction affect values, as well. Colors appear darker on or near lighter colors, and lighter on or near darker colors. Complementaries will look more intense on or near each other than they will on or near grays.

== Full declaration of a type can be deferred to the unit's body ==

Often, you'll want to make changes to the internals of a private type.  This, in turn, will require the algorithms that act on it to be modified.  If the type is completed in the unit specification, it is a pain to edit and recompile both files, even with an [[Wikipedia:Integrated development environment|IDE]], but it's something some programmers learn to live with.

It turns out you don't have to.  Nonchalantly mentioned in the [http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TTL.html ARM], and generally skipped over in tutorials, is the fact that private types can be completed in the unit's body itself, making them much closer to the relevant code, and saving a recompile of the specification, as well as every unit depending on it.  This may seem like a small thing, and, for small projects, it is.  However, if you have one of those uncooperative types that requires dozens of tweaks, or if your dependence graph has much depth, the time and annoyance saved add up quickly.

Also, this construction is very useful when coding a shared library, because it permits to change the implementation of the type while still providing a compatible [[w:Application_binary_interface|ABI]].

Code sample:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Private_And_Body {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 
   {{Ada/--|Operations...}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Body_Type;   {{Ada/--|incomplete type declaration completed in the body}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Private_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Body_Type;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Private_And_Body;

The type in the public part is an [[Ada Programming/Types/access|access]] to the hidden type. This has the drawback that memory management has to be provided by the package implementation. That is the reason why &lt;tt&gt;Private_Type&lt;/tt&gt; is a limited type, the client will not be allowed to copy the access values, in order to prevent dangling references.

Normally, the full type definition has to be given in the specification because the compiler has to know how much place to allocate to objects in order to produce code using this type. And the astute reader will note that also in this case the full type definition is given for Private_Type: it is an access to some other (albeit incomplete) type, and the size of an access value is known. This is why the full type definition of Body_Type can be moved to the body.

The construction centering around &lt;tt&gt;Private_Type&lt;/tt&gt; is sometimes called an [[w:opaque pointer|opaque pointer]].

== Lambda calculus through generics ==

Suppose you've decided to roll your own [[Wikipedia:Set (computer science)|set]] type. You can add things to it, remove things from it, and you want to let a user apply some arbitrary function to all of its members. But the scoping rules seem to conspire against you, forcing nearly everything to be global.

The mental stumbling block is that most examples given of [[../Generics|generics]] are packages, and the Set package is already generic. In this case, the solution is to make the Apply_To_All procedure generic as well; that is, to nest the generics. Generic procedures inside packages exist in a strange scoping limbo, where anything in scope at the instantiation can be used by the instantiation, and anything normally in scope at the formal can be accessed by the formal. The end result is that the relevant scoping roadblocks no longer apply. It isn't the full lambda calculus, just one of the most useful parts.

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Element {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Sets {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Set {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    ''[..]''
   {{Ada/kw|generic}}
     {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Apply_To_One (The_Element : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Element);
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Apply_To_All (The_Set : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Set);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Sets;

For a view of Functional Programming in Ada see &lt;ref&gt;[http://okasaki.blogspot.com/2008/07/functional-programming-inada.html Functional Programming in...Ada?], by Chris Okasaki&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Compiler Messages ==

Different compilers can diagnose different things differently, or the same thing using different messages, etc..
Having two compilers at hand can be useful.

; &lt;code&gt;selected component&lt;/code&gt;: When a source program contains a construct such as &lt;code&gt;Foo.Bar&lt;/code&gt;, you may see messages saying something like &amp;laquo;selected component &quot;Bar&quot;&amp;raquo; or maybe like &amp;laquo;selected component &quot;Foo&quot;&amp;raquo;. The phrases may seem confusing, because one refers to &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;, while the other refers to &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt;. But they are both right. The reason is that &lt;tt&gt;selected_component&lt;/tt&gt; is an item from Ada's grammar ({{Ada/RM3|4|1|3|Selected Components}}). It denotes all of: a prefix, a dot, and a selector_name. In the &lt;code&gt;Foo.Bar&lt;/code&gt; example these correspond to &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;, '&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;', and &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt;. Look for more grammar words in the compiler messages, e.g. &amp;laquo;prefix&amp;raquo;, and associate them with identifiers quoted in the messages.

: For example, if you submit the following code to the compiler,

 {{Ada/keyword|with}} ''Pak''{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 {{Ada/keyword|package}} Foo {{Ada/keyword|is}}
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} T {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|new}} ''Pak''{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Bar{{Ada/delimiter|;}}  {{Ada/comment| Oops, Pak is generic!}}
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Foo{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

: the compiler may print a diagnostic message about a prefixed component: &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;'s author thought that &lt;code&gt;Pak&lt;/code&gt; denotes a package, but actually it is the name of a ''generic'' package. (Which needs to be instantiated first; and then the ''instance'' name is a suitable prefix.)

== Universal integers ==

All integer literals and also some attributes like &lt;code&gt;'Length&lt;/code&gt; are of the anonymous type ''universal_integer'', which comprises the infinite set of mathematical integers. Named numbers are of this type and are evaluated exactly (no overflow except for machine storage limitations), e.g.

  Very_Big: {{Ada/keyword|constant}} := 10**1_000_000 - 1;

Since ''universal_integer'' has no operators, its values are converted in this example to ''root_integer'', another anonymous type, the calcuation is performed and the result again converted back in ''universal_integer''.

Generally values of ''universal_integer'' are implicitly converted to the appropriate type when used in some expression. So the expression &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|not}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}}&lt;/code&gt; is fine; the value of &lt;code&gt;A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}}&lt;/code&gt; is interpreted as a modular integer since {{Ada/keyword|not}} can only be applied to modular integers (of course a context is needed to decide which modular integer type is meant). This feature can lead to pitfalls. Consider

    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Ran_6 {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|range}} 1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 6{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Mod_6 {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|mod}} 6{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

and then

    {{Ada/comment| 1}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Ran_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| OK}}
       &amp;hellip;
 
    {{Ada/comment| 2}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} {{Ada/keyword|not}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Ran_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| not OK}}
       &amp;hellip;
    {{Ada/comment| this is the same as}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} ({{Ada/keyword|not}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}}) {{Ada/keyword|in}} Ran_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| not OK}}
       &amp;hellip;
 
    {{Ada/comment| 3}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} 1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| OK}}
       &amp;hellip;
 
    {{Ada/comment| 4}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} {{Ada/keyword|not}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} 1 {{Ada/delimiter|..}} 6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| not OK}}
       &amp;hellip;
 
    {{Ada/comment| 5}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Mod_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| OK?}}
       &amp;hellip;
 
    {{Ada/comment| 6}}
    {{Ada/keyword|if}} {{Ada/keyword|not}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Mod_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| OK?}}
       &amp;hellip;

:The second conditional cannot be compiled because the expressions to the left of &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|in}}&lt;/code&gt; is incompatible to the type at the right. Note that &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|not}}&lt;/code&gt; has precedence over &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|in}}&lt;/code&gt;. It does not negate the entire membership test but only &lt;code&gt;A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}}&lt;/code&gt;.

: The fourth conditional fails in various ways.

: The sixth conditional might be fine because &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|not}}&lt;/code&gt; turns &lt;code&gt;A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}}&lt;/code&gt; into a modular value which is OK if the value is covered by modular type &lt;code&gt;Mod_6&lt;/code&gt;. 

: GNAT GPL 2009 gives these diagnoses respectively:

 error: incompatible types
 error: operand of not must be enclosed in parentheses
 warning: not expression should be parenthesized here

: A way to ''avoid'' these problems is to use &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/keyword|not}} {{Ada/keyword|in}}&lt;/code&gt; for the membership test (which, btw., is the language-intended form),

    {{Ada/keyword|if}} A{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Length}} {{Ada/keyword|not}} {{Ada/keyword|in}} Ran_6 {{Ada/keyword|then}}  {{Ada/comment| OK}}
       &amp;hellip;

== I/O ==

=== Text_IO Issues ===

A canonical method of reading a sequence of lines from a text file uses the standard procedure {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}.''Get_Line''.
When the end of input is reached, ''Get_Line'' will fail, and exception ''End_Error'' is raised. Some programs will use another function
from {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}} to prevent this and test for ''End_of_File''. However, this isn't always the best choice, as has been explained
for example in a Get_Line news group discussion on
[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ada/browse_thread/thread/5afe598156615c8b# comp.lang.ada].

A working solution uses an exception handler instead:

   {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
      The_Line{{Ada/delimiter|:}} String{{Ada/delimiter|(}}1{{Ada/delimiter|..}}100{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      Last{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Natural{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
      {{Ada/keyword|loop}}
         Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Get_Line{{Ada/delimiter|(}}The_Line{{Ada/delimiter|,}} Last{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
         {{Ada/comment| do something with The_Line ...}}
      {{Ada/keyword|end}} {{Ada/keyword|loop}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|exception}}
      {{Ada/keyword|when}} Text_IO{{Ada/delimiter|.}}End_Error {{Ada/delimiter|1= =&gt;}}
         {{Ada/keyword|null}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

The function End_of_File RM A.10.1(34) works fine as long as the file follows the canonical form of text files presumed by Ada, which is always the case when the file has been written by {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}}. This canonical form requires an End_of_Line marker followed by an End_of_Page marker at the very end before the End_of_File.

If the file was produced by another any other means, it will generally not have this canonical form, so a test for End_of_File will fail. That's why the exception End_Error has to be used in those cases (which always works).

== Quirks ==

Using GNAT on Windows, calls to subprograms from {{Ada/package|Ada|Real_Time}} might need special attention. (For example, the &lt;code&gt;Real_Time.Clock&lt;/code&gt; function might seem to return values indicating that no time has passed between two invocations when certainly some time has passed.) The cause is reported to be a missing initialization of the run-time support when no other real-time features are present in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ada/Cite cla

 {{Ada/keyword|delay}} 0{{Ada/delimiter|.}}0{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

before any use of &lt;code&gt;Real_Time&lt;/code&gt; services.

=== Stack Size ===

With some implementations, notably GNAT, knowledge of stack size manipulation will be to your advantage. Executables produced with GNAT tools and standard settings can hit the stack size limit. If so, the operating system might allow setting higher limits. Using GNU/Linux and the Bash command shell, try

 $ ulimit -s [some number]

The current value is printed when only &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; is given to ''ulimit''.

== New book conversion more or less finished, Current LMOS ==
The conversion form Jim Heffron's book to wikibooks is now more or less complete.  There are still a number of pages from the old book which can be found at [[Linear Algebra/OLD/TOC]].  These pages should either be merged, or (I think) could be used as a seed for a more advanced book on linear algebra for Mathematics majors.  In terms of a local MOS, all mathematics is contained between &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, regardless of inline or displayed.  Theorems, lemmas, remarks, examples, exercises, etc. should be in a {{tlx|TextBox}}.  The book is written in American English.

== Duplicate page ==

There is both a page&lt;br&gt;
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linear_Algebra/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors (no capital letter)&lt;br&gt;
and&lt;br&gt;
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linear_Algebra/Eigenvalues_and_Eigenvectors (with capital letter)&lt;br&gt;
But these are different pages. The table of contents of this book links to the latter, which seems to be the most maintained. But the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue,_eigenvector_and_eigenspace wikipedia article about eigenvalues/vectors] links to the former. Maybe the former should be removed and the wikipedia article changed?

==Suggested points of discussion from failed [[WB:Featured books/Nominations]]==
I think what happens next is discussion continues in the book's discussion pages by book contributors and those with issues with the book. Things to consider discussing more in the book's discussion pages might be:
# Does the book need a new name?
# Does the scope and audience of the book need to be better defined?
# Do parts need to be rewritten to be easier to follow and understand?
# Can missing material be added to reduce or eliminate a need to depend on Wikipedia links?
# How can this book be made better?

== Outdated ==

This is a great wikibook and I am very impressed by the work done on it; however, [http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/ the book it is based off] is updated very regularly, while this one is not. I question whether it might be better to just redirect readers to the original.

:How much has changed in the area of linear algebra? Is it just some of the applications sections? Or is it reorganization of the sections? [[User:Rgrasmus|Rgrasmus]] ([[User talk:Rgrasmus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rgrasmus|contribs]]) 15:36, 24 April 2013 (UTC)
:*Agree, this is more a unsophisticated &quot;young-Wikipedian&quot; attitude I wouldn't expect to see much here on Wikibooks&amp;mdash;it is a fallacy that all fields of knowledge are progressing at an breakneck pace rather than a recognition that things like mathematical theory or even physics fundamentals are rather stable and updating is hardly ever needed. A lot of the inflation of the cost of education could be eliminated by holding down the switching of texts for standard courses. For example, I have a physics text published in 1911, and 98% of it is still spot on, most of the rest is new theory-but for understanding fundamental mechanics and non-relativistic physics, Newtonian physics, the book is perfectly well suited. 
:: Secondarily, if Mathematicians were good at having applications sections people would actually understand the topics. As an engineer, imho, the whole pedagogy mindset sucks. They do really poorly at relating math to the real world. 
:: Next time, when tagging like these, please put the template in the edit summary. Finding when it was hung and by who would save others time, and have brought me to this note sooner. // [[User:Fabartus|Fra]]&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Fabartus|nkB]]&lt;/font&gt; 15:15, 31 July 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Programmable devices==
===Microcontrollers===
These days using programmable components is easy. In the early days you had to write code in assembly, burn it in an EPROM, plug the EPROM in its socket and hope you didn't make any mistake. Because if you did, you had to hunt down the error in hundreds of lines of cryptic assembly code and had to use a new EPROM. These days you've got flash memory which can be reprogrammed in circuit. You've got C and Basic compilers to write your code. Most µcontrollers have a whole lot of hardware on chip (UART, Watchdog, Real Time Clock, RAM, ROM, EEPROM,...) and libraries are available for different programming languages which make coding LC-displays or Servos very easy. Not to mention you've got emulators (A special connector plugged into the MICROcontroller socket which allows a PC to pretend to be the µcontroller) and simulators (simulates the µcontroller on a PC and allows to run its code) to hunt down the bugs.

==== AVR ====
A good µcontroller to start with is the Atmel AVR [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=3229 ATtiny2313] (previously: AT90S2313) or [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=2008 ATMEGA8535] (previously: AT90S8535) (Atmel). It's cheap, has all the essentials on chip and has a whole lot of websites dedicated to it. The 8535 is more expensive, but has more memory and has an on board ADC. An AVR combined with [http://www.mcselec.com/bascom-avr.htm Bascom-AVR] is pretty much the easiest way to start with µcontrollers.

''See [[Embedded Systems/Atmel AVR|Atmel AVR]] for details.''

''See [[Robotics/Computer Control/The Interface/Microcontrollers]] for other popular microcontrollers.''

''See [[General Engineering Introduction/Arduino and Motors/Arduino Introduction]] for one way to do AVR development.''

===PC===
The PC has many advantages over µcontrollers when it comes to controlling a robot. However it has 2 flaws that make it nearly impossible to use in small robot-projects:
* First: it's large and heavy.
* Secondly: A modern pc consumes enormous amounts of power.
This means that PCs are limited to tethered or large robots. If power isn't a problem the PC offers enormous amounts of RAM and HD space and plenty of CPU power. Plus a very handy user interface. Also network capabilities can be very useful for some applications. Providing your robot with a wireless connection (IR, radio, WiFi, bluetooth,...) and a similar interface on the PC reduces the wire-problem to a limited-distance (or in the case of IR a line-of-sight) problem.

If you intend to use a PC in your project, you might want to use one of the flavors of linux as the OS, as it allows easy access to any of the parts of the computer. Another choice for an OS is the older MS-DOS, although MS-DOS lacks multithreading (but those can be added in your software) and has ugly memory management (remember the 640Kb limit?).

===Laptop===
The laptop has only its size against it. A laptop provides the benefits of a PC without the enormous power consumption. The downside to laptops is their limited battery life.

===PDA===
The &lt;b&gt;PDA&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;ersonal &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;igital &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;ssistant) is nothing more than a hand held &lt;b&gt;PC&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;ersonal &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;omputer).  Most of the time these units used scaled down &lt;b&gt;RISC&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;educed &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;nstruction &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;et &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;hip) processors to allow for fast execution times and also allow the unit to remain smaller and lighter than your average laptop. Some PDA's even have built-in GPS which makes it very interesting for outdoor robot applications. The downside is their price. The PDA is useful for play, but also serves as a great business tool especially when they are equipped with a stylus.

===Gameboy===
The Gameboy (the classic, advance, color and DS) can be a very powerful device. These have been used in many projects (see google). The only drawback is constructing the special PCB to act as a connector.

===Gameboy Advance (GBA) ===

The Gameboy Advance is also excellent as a robotics platform. There are a few complete open-source development suites available (GCC based C/C++ plus ARM assember). There is also a good kit (Charmed Labs) available to interface Lego robotics motors/sensors and give much more control compared to the Lego RCX. With 4MB of FLASH and a few hundred K of RAM the kit has huge potential. The kit is not really for the complete beginner though as setting up the GNU tools can be quite complicated although the development environment is consequently very rich.

''See [[GBA Development]] for tips on writing software for the Game Boy Advance.''

===Programmable Logic Controllers===
Programmable logic controllers, PLCs, are special purpose industrial computers, made to be easy to interface with electrical circuits. Most PLC are expandable but there are some compact &quot;all-in-one&quot; solutions as well. They have excellent bit-manipulating possibilities, and add-on-cards for several special signals as high-speed counters, analog I/O, networks and fieldbuses (RS-232, RS422, RS-485, Ethernet, DeviceNet, Profibus...), pulse output, servo control, etc. Increasingly, special inputs are included in the PLC CPU unit. PLCs are traditionally used to control automated factories, possibly several machines per PLC. They normally use special-purpose programming languages, most commonly ladder or SFC.

PLCs are available in sizes from approximately 5x5x5 cm (there is a PLC IC available as well, but for the purposes of this book we choose to ignore that fact). The smallest ones are very limited though, with only a few I/Os and very limited memory, and also very limited instruction set with regards to data processing and calculations. PLCs are especially suitable if you have a lot of experience of electric systems, but feel intimidated by designing and soldering PCBs and programming computers (i.e., you are an electrician). They also shine in very large system with many special purpose sensors and outputs, as mostly there will be a standard solution from the manufacturer that is possible to use.

The downside with PLCs are their price - They can be quite costly, normally at least an order of magnitude higher than microcontrollers. They also draw more current than a microcontroller, however less than a computer. On the other hand, compared to a computer, they are computationally weak. They aren't suited for heavy signal-processing work.

PLC:s are best suited for large robots, but could be usable in medium-sized projects as well.

===Combinations===
It's common to use both a computer/laptop/PDA and (a) microcontroller(s) as those 2 complement each others limitations. e.g. The first has the advantage of large amounts of memory and processing power, however lacks specific outputs that are very handy in robotics, like PWM. Microcontrollers commonly have PWM channels that operate independently of the rest of the microcontroller, but are limited in their processing speed and memory.&lt;BR&gt; Linking those 2 devices provides the best of both worlds.

==Programming languages==
[[Robotics: Design Basics: Design software#Programming Languages|This]] page discusses some of the available programming languages and provides links to download compilers for those languages.

===Which language to pick?===
The choice of language depends on a few points:

*previous experience. If you're already comfortable with a particular programming language, you'll probably want to use that language for programming your robot.

*How much time and effort you intend to invest. Not every language is equally hard/easy to use. Most of the complexity of a language comes from allowing more low-level access. Basically the more control a language gives to the user, the harder it is to use, but also the more powerful it is. In theory Assembly would allow a programmer to write the fastest and smallest code. However this is only true for an experienced programmer. Modern compilers can generate code that comes near to hand written Assembly. In most cases, using Assembly needlessly complicates a program, with the exception of using inline assembly in a C or Basic program. Usually these are a few lines of code which work directly with memory, or have to execute in a known time. For many if not most projects, a language such as Basic or C suffices. Only if you intend to push a microcontroller or PC to the limits of its capabilities is it worth the trouble of writing Assembly code.
*your goals. If you want a simple robot, you wouldn't need Assembly code at all. With modern microcontroller you can easily write sloppy Basic code and still have sufficient speed and memory. If you intend to build a cutting edge robot with a few dozen sensors, image recognition and speech recognition you'll need to write perfect code and will need Assembly for some of the components in order to have enough speed and be able to fit the code in the limited memory of the microcontroller(s). Most projects will fall in between these two extremes and good written Basic or C code would be more than sufficient. Knowing (some) Assembly can be useful as it'll give some insight on how processors work. Such insights make you a better programmer.
*Availability. Not all languages are available for all microcontrollers. Urbi is open source, C and Basic and Forth are common, often as freeware, other languages might be available commercially, or not at all.

==Writing your software==
This section doesn't intend to teach the basics of programming, just those points that aren't addressed in most programming tutorials and beginners books.

*Style. &quot;Style&quot; is how you indent your lines, how you pick your variable and function names. Pick one and stick with it throughout your program. Especially for functions and variables you should decide when to use capital letters, underscores and when to stick words together. Doing this the same everywhere makes it easier not to miss-spell names.
*Use informative names. Functions, procedures and variables should have informative names. Their purpose should be clear.
*Plan before coding. In software development there are two important steps before coding: requirement analysis and software architecture. The first is about finding out what the program is expected to do, what inputs to expect, which output it should generate and what the limitations of its environment are going to be. The latter involves working out how the program is going to be structured, which data types to use, which algorithms, how the input is going to enter the program and how to make sure it's valid and how to format the output. Using a lite version of these steps will make it much easier to write a decent program. If you intend to build a more complicated robot, you'll going to need to invest more time in planning out your software. Have all your software requirements written out first. Then pick a few of the most critical requirements and refine them. Implement those first. After you're done with those (this includes throughfully testing them), pick a new set and refine and implement those. By doing it in small steps you avoid having to write out everything at the start (and making many assumptions) and get to use the insights you get by coding parts of it.
*Use PDL (Program Development Language) PDL is a method to write functions. It involves writing down the individual steps of a function in plain English without referring to language-specific things, then refining these steps into smaller steps, until it's easier to write the code than to split the steps further. Afterward leave the PDL lines in as comments.
*Simulation and Debugging Learn to use the simulator. It's easier to find errors there than in the hardware. Also learn to use the debugger. It's your best friend for finding errors.
*If your software runs on a PC a log-file can be useful. But be picky with what you let the software log. If you intend to run it for a long time those log-files can become massive. If you want to log sensor data over time, know that these can be imported in Excel by saving the data with spaces between them to separate columns and newlines to separate rows. ''See [[w:Comma-separated values]].''

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== What's an Access Type? ==

Access types in Ada are what other languages call pointers. They point to objects located at certain addresses. So normally one can think of access types as simple addresses (there are exceptions from this simplified view). Ada instead of saying ''points to'' talks of ''granting access to'' or ''designating'' an object.

Objects of access types are implicitly initialized with {{Ada/kw|null}}, i.e. they point to nothing when not explicitly initialized.

Access types should be used rarely in Ada. In a lot of circumstances where pointers are used in other languages, there are other ways without pointers. If you need dynamic data structures, first check whether you can use the Ada Container library. Especially for indefinite record or array components, the Ada 2012 package Indefinite_Holders (RM {{Ada/RM|A|18|18}}) can be used instead of pointers.

There are four kinds of access types in Ada: Pool access types - General access types - Anonymous access types - Access to subprogram types.

== Pool access ==

A ''pool access type'' handles accesses to objects which were created on some specific heap (or storage pool as it is called in Ada). A pointer of these types cannot point to a stack or library level (static) object or an object in a different storage pool. Therefore, conversion between pool access types is illegal. (Unchecked_Conversion may be used, but note that deallocation via an access object with a storage pool different from the one it was allocated with is erroneous.)

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Person {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   First_Name : String (1..30);
   Last_Name  : String (1..20);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Person_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Person;

A size clause may be used to limit the corresponding (implementation defined anonymous) storage pool. A size clause of 0 disables calls of an allocator.

 {{Ada/kw|for}} Person_Access'{{Ada/kw|Size}} {{Ada/kw|use}} 0;

The storage pool is implementation defined if not specified. Ada supports user defined storage pools, so you can define the storage pool with

 {{Ada/kw|for}} Person_Access'{{Ada/attribute|Storage_Pool}} {{Ada/kw|use}} Pool_Name;

Objects in a storage pool are created with the keyword {{Ada/kw|new}}:

 Father: Person_Access := {{Ada/kw|new}} Person;                                          -- uninitialized
 Mother: Person_Access := {{Ada/kw|new}} Person'(Mothers_First_Name, Mothers_Last_Name);  -- initialized

You access the object in the storage pool by appending &lt;code&gt;.{{Ada/kw|all}}&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Mother.{{Ada/kw|all}}&lt;/code&gt; is the complete record; components are denoted as usual with the dot notation: &lt;code&gt;Mother.{{Ada/kw|all}}.First_Name&lt;/code&gt;. When accessing components, ''implicit dereferencing'' (i.e. omitting {{Ada/kw|all}}) can serve as a convenient shorthand:

 Mother.{{Ada/kw|all}} := (Last_Name =&gt; Father.Last_Name, First_Name =&gt; Mother.First_Name);  -- marriage

Implicit dereferencing also applies to arrays:

   {{Ada/kw|type}} Vector {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. 3) {{Ada/kw|of}} Complex;
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Vector_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Vector;
 
   VA: Vector_Access := {{Ada/kw|new}} Vector;
   VB: {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. 3) {{Ada/kw|of}} Vector_Access := ({{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt; {{Ada/kw|new}} Vector);
 
   C1: Complex := VA (3);    -- a shorter equivalent for VA   .{{Ada/kw|all}} (3)
   C2: Complex := VB (3)(1); -- a shorter equivalent for VB(3).{{Ada/kw|all}} (1)

Be careful to discriminate between deep and shallow copies when copying with access objects:

 Obj1.{{Ada/kw|all}} := Obj2.{{Ada/kw|all}};  -- Deep copy: Obj1 still refers to an object
                        -- different from Obj2, but it has the same content
 Obj1 := Obj2;          -- Shallow copy: Obj1 now refers to the same object as Obj2

=== Deleting objects from a storage pool ===

Although the Ada standard mentions a garbage collector, which would automatically remove all unneeded objects that have been created on the heap (when no storage pool has been defined), only Ada compilers targeting a virtual machine like Java or .NET actually have garbage collectors. &lt;s&gt;There is also a &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|pragma}} Controlled&lt;/code&gt;, which, when applied to such an access type, prevents automatic garbage collection of objects created with it.&lt;/s&gt; Note that &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|pragma}} Controlled&lt;/code&gt; will be dropped from Ada 2012, subpools for storage management replacing it. See RM 2012 {{Ada/2012/RM|13|11|3}} and {{Ada/2012/RM|13|11|4}}.

Therefore in order to delete an object from the heap, you need the generic unit {{Ada/package|Ada|Unchecked_Deallocation}}. Apply utmost care to not create dangling pointers when deallocating objects as is shown in the example below. (And note that deallocating objects with a different access type than the one with which they were created is erroneous when the corresponding storage pools are different.)

 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Unchecked_Deallocation}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Deallocation_Sample {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Vector     {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Float;
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Vector_Ref {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Vector;
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Free_Vector {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Unchecked_Deallocation}}
       (Object =&gt; Vector, Name =&gt; Vector_Ref);
   
    VA, VB: Vector_Ref;
    V     : Vector;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
    VA     := {{Ada/kw|new}} Vector (1 .. 10);
    VB     := VA;  -- points to the same location as VA
 
    VA.{{Ada/kw|all}} := ({{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt; 0.0);
 
    --  ... Do whatever you need to do with the vector
 
    Free_Vector (VA); -- The memory is deallocated and VA is now null
 
    V := VB.all;  -- VB is not null, access to a dangling pointer is erroneous
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Deallocation_Sample;

It is exactly because of this problem with dangling pointers that the deallocation operation is called '''unchecked'''. It is the chore of the programmer to take care that this does not happen.

Since Ada allows for user defined storage pools, you could also try a [[Ada Programming/Libraries/MultiPurpose/AdaCL#Garbage_Collector|garbage collector library]].

=== Constructing Reference Counting Pointers ===

You can find some implementations of reference counting pointers, called ''Safe'' or ''Smart Pointers'', on the net. Using such a type prevents caring about deallocation, since this will automatically be done when there are no more pointers to an object. But be careful - most of those implementations do not prevent deliberate deallocation, thus undermining the alledged safety attained with their use.

A nice tutorial how to construct such a type can be found in a series of Gems on the AdaCore web site.

[http://www.adacore.com/2011/01/17/gem-97-reference-counting-in-ada-part-1/ Gem #97: Reference Counting in Ada – Part 1] This little gem constructs a simple reference counted pointer that does not prevent deallocation, i.e. is inherently unsafe.

[http://www.adacore.com/2011/06/06/gem-107-preventing-deallocation-for-reference-counted-types/ Gem #107: Preventing Deallocation for Reference-counted Types] This further gem describes how to arrive at a pointer type whose safety cannot be compromised (tasking issues aside). The cost of this improved safety is awkward syntax.

[http://www.adacore.com/adaanswers/gems/gem-123-implicit-dereferencing-in-ada-2012/ Gem #123: Implicit Dereferencing in Ada 2012] This gem shows how to simplify the syntax with the new Ada 2012 generation. (Admittedly, this gem is a bit unrelated to reference counting since the new language feature can be applied to any kind of container.)

== General access ==

''General access types'' grant access to objects created on any storage pool, on the stack or at library level (static). They come in two versions, granting either read-write access or read-only access. Conversions between general access types are allowed, but subject to certain access level checks.

Dereferencing is like for pool access types. Objects (other than pool objects) to be referenced have to be declared {{Ada/kw|aliased}}, and references to them are created with the attribute &lt;code&gt;'Access&lt;/code&gt;. Access level restrictions prevent accesses to objects from outliving the accessed object, which would make the program erroneous. The attribute &lt;code&gt;'Unchecked_Access&lt;/code&gt; omits the corresponding checks.

=== Access to Variable ===

When the keyword {{Ada/kw|all}} is used in their definition, they grant read-write access.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|all}} Day_Of_Month;

=== Access to Constant ===

General access types granting read-only access to the referenced object use the keyword {{Ada/kw|constant}} in their definition. The referenced object may be a constant or a variable.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Day_Of_Month;

=== Some examples ===

  {{Ada/kw|type}} General_Pointer  {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|all}}      Integer;
  {{Ada/kw|type}} Constant_Pointer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer;
 
  I1: {{Ada/kw|aliased}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer := 10;
  I2: {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Integer;
 
  P1: General_Pointer  := I1'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};  -- illegal
  P2: Constant_Pointer := I1'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};  -- OK, read only
  P3: General_Pointer  := I2'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};  -- OK, read and write
  P4: Constant_Pointer := I2'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};  -- OK, read only
 
  P5: {{Ada/kw|constant}} General_Pointer := I2'Access;  -- read and write only to I2

== Anonymous access ==

Also ''Anonymous access types'' come in two versions like general access types, granting either read-write access or read-only access depending on whether the keyword {{Ada/kw|constant}} appears.

An anonymous access can be used as a parameter to a subprogram or as a discriminant. Here are some examples:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Modify (Some_Day: {{Ada/kw|access}}          Day_Of_Month);
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Test   (Some_Day: {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Day_Of_Month);  -- Ada 2005 only

 {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|type}} Thread (Execute_For_Day: {{Ada/kw|access}} Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|is}}
    ...
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Thread;

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Data (Store_For_Day: {{Ada/kw|access}} Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
    --  components
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};

Before using an anonymous access, you should consider a named access type or, even better, consider if the &quot;{{Ada/kw|out}}&quot; or &quot;{{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}}&quot; modifier is not more appropriate.

{{Ada/2005|Access}}

In Ada 2005, anonymous accesses are allowed in more circumstances:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}}
   M   : Integer;
   Next: {{Ada/kw|access}} Object;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 X: {{Ada/kw|access}} Integer;
 
 {{Ada/kw|function}} F {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float;
== Implicit Dereference ==
Ada 2012 will simplify accesses to objects via pointers with new syntax.

Imagine you have a container holding some kind of elements.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Container   {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_Ptr {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Element;
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put (X: Element; Into: {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Container);

Now how do you access elements stored in the container. Of course you can retrieve them by

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Get (From: Container) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element;

This will however copy the element, which is unfortunate if the element is big. You get direct access with

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Get (From: Container) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element_Ptr;

Now pointers are dangerous since you might easily create dangling pointers like so:

 P: Element_Ptr := Get (Cont);
 P.{{Ada/kw|all}} := E;
 Free (P);
 ... Get (Cont) -- this is now a dangling pointer

Use of an accessor object instead of an access type can prevent inadvertant deallocation (this is still Ada 2005):

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Accessor (Data: {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Element) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};  -- read/write access
 {{Ada/kw|function}} Get (From: Container) {{Ada/kw|return}} Accessor;

(For the null exclusion {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} in the declaration of the discriminant, see below). Access via such an accessor is safe: The discriminant can only be used for dereferencing, it cannot be copied to an object of type Element_Ptr because its accessibility level is deeper. In the form above, the accessor provides read and write access. If the keyword {{Ada/kw|constant}} is added, only read access is possible.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Accessor (Data: {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|constant}} Element) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};  -- only read access

Access to the container object now looks like so:

 Get (Cont).{{Ada/kw|all}}      := E;  -- via access type: dangerous
 Get (Cont).Data.{{Ada/kw|all}} := E;  -- via accessor: safe, but ugly

Here the new Ada 2012 feature of ''aspects'' comes along handy; for the case at hand, the aspect ''Implicit_Dereference'' is the one we need:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Accessor (Data: {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Element) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} Implicit_Dereference =&gt; Data;

Now rather than writing the long and ugly function call of above, we can just omit the discriminant and its dereference like so:

 Get (Cont).Data.{{Ada/kw|all}} := E;  -- Ada 2005 via accessor: safe, but ugly
 Get (Cont)          := E;  -- Ada 2012 implicit dereference

Note that the call &lt;code&gt;Get (Cont)&lt;/code&gt; is overloaded — it can denote the accessor object or the element, the compiler will select the correct interpretation depending on context.

== Null exclusions ==

{{Ada/2005|Access}}

All access subtypes can be modified with {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}}, objects of such a subtype can then never have the value null, so initializations are compulsory.

 {{Ada/kw|type}}    Day_Of_Month_Access          {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}}   Day_Of_Month;
 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Day_Of_Month_Not_Null_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} Day_Of_Month_Access;

The language also allows to declare ''the first subtype'' directly with a null exclusion:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Day_Of_Month;

However, in nearly all cases this is not a good idea because it renders objects of this type nearly unusable (for example, you are unable to free the allocated memory). Not null accesses are intended for access ''subtypes'', object ''declarations'', and subprogram ''parameters''.[http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ada/msg/13a41ced7af75192]

== Access to Subprogram ==

An access to subprogram allows the caller to call a [[Ada Programming/Subprograms|subprogram]] without knowing its name nor its declaration location. One of the uses of this kind of access is the well known callbacks.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Callback_Procedure {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} (Id  : Integer;
                                              Text: String);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Callback_Function {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|function}} (The_Alarm: Alarm) {{Ada/kw|return}} Natural;

For getting an access to a subprogram, the attribute {{Ada/attribute|Access}} is applied to a subprogram name with the proper parameter and result profile.

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Process_Event (Id  : Integer;
                          Text: String);
 
 My_Callback: Callback_Procedure := Process_Event'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};

=== Anonymous access to Subprogram ===

{{Ada/2005|Access}}

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Test (Call_Back: {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} (Id: Integer; Text: String));

There is now no limit on the number of keyword in a sequence:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} F {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|function}} {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|function}} {{Ada/kw|return}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Some_Type;

This is a function that returns the access to a function that in turn returns an access to a function returning an access to some type.

== Access FAQ ==

A few &quot;Frequently Asked Question&quot; and &quot;Frequently Encountered Problems&quot; (mostly from [[Programming:C|C]] users) regarding Ada's access types.

=== Access vs. access all ===

An {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|all}} can do anything a simple {{Ada/kw|access}} can do. So one might ask: &quot;Why use simple {{Ada/kw|access}} at all?&quot; - And indeed some programmers never use simple {{Ada/kw|access}}.

Unchecked_Deallocation is always dangerous if misused. It is just as easy to deallocate a pool-specific object twice, and just as dangerous as deallocating a stack object. The advantage of &quot;access all&quot; is that you may not need to use Unchecked_Deallocation at all.

Moral: if you have (or may have) a valid reason to store an 'Access or 'Unchecked_Access into an access object, then use &quot;access all&quot; and don't worry about it. If not, the mantra of &quot;least privilege&quot; suggests that the &quot;all&quot; should be left out (don't enable capabilities that you are not going to use).

The following (perhaps disastrous) example will try to deallocate a stack object:

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|all}} Day_Of_Month;
 
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Free {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Ada.Unchecked_Deallocation
       (Object =&gt; Day_Of_Month
        Name   =&gt; Day_Of_Month_Access);
 
   A  : {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Day_Of_Month;
   Ptr: Day_Of_Month_Access := A'{{Ada/attribute|Access}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
    Free(Ptr);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

With a simple {{Ada/kw|access}} you know at least that you won't try to deallocate a stack object.

=== Access vs. System.Address ===

An access can be something different from a mere memory address, it may be something more. For example, an &quot;access to String&quot; often needs some way of storing the string size as well. If you need a simple address and are not concerned about strong typing, use the System.Address type.

=== C compatible pointer === 

The correct way to create a C compatible access is to use {{Ada/pragma|Convention}}:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;
 {{Ada/kw|for}}  Day_Of_Month'{{Ada/attribute|Size}} {{Ada/kw|use}} Interfaces.C.int'{{Ada/attribute|Size}};
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (Convention =&gt; C,
                    Entity     =&gt; Day_Of_Month);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month_Access {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Day_Of_Month;
 
 {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (Convention =&gt; C,
                    Entity     =&gt; Day_Of_Month_Access);

{{Ada/pragma|Convention}} should be used on any type you want to use in C. The compiler will warn you if the type cannot be made C compatible.

You may also consider the following - shorter - alternative when declaring Day_Of_Month:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Interfaces.C.int {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;

Before you use access types in C, you should consider using the normal &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out&quot; and &quot;in out&quot; modifiers. {{Ada/pragma|Export}} and {{Ada/pragma|Import}} know how parameters are usually passed in C and will use a pointer to pass a parameter automatically where C would have used them as well. Of course the RM contains precise rules on when to use a pointer for &quot;in&quot;, &quot;out&quot;, and &quot;in out&quot; - see &quot;{{Ada/RM|B|3|title=Interfacing with C}}&quot;.

=== Where is void*? ===

While actually a problem for &quot;interfacing with C&quot;, here are some possible solutions:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Test {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Pvoid {{Ada/kw|is}} System.Address;
 
   -- the declaration in C looks like this:
   -- int C_fun(int *)
   {{Ada/kw|function}} C_fun (pv: Pvoid) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer;
   {{Ada/pragma|Import}} (Convention    =&gt; C,
                  Entity        =&gt; C_fun,     -- any Ada name
                  External_Name =&gt; &quot;C_fun&quot;);  -- the C name
 
   Pointer: Pvoid;
 
   Input_Parameter: {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Integer := 32;
   Return_Value   : Integer;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   Pointer      := Input_Parameter'{{Ada/attribute|Address}};
   Return_Value := C_fun (Pointer);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Test;

Less portable but perhaps more usable &lt;small&gt;(for 32 bit CPUs)&lt;/small&gt;:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} void {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} 2 ** 32;
 {{Ada/kw|for}} void'{{Ada/attribute|Size}} {{Ada/kw|use}} 32;

With GNAT you can get 32/64 bit portability by using:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} void {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} System.Memory_Size;
 {{Ada/kw|for}} void'{{Ada/attribute|Size}} {{Ada/kw|use}} System.Word_Size;

Closer to the true nature of void - pointing to an element of zero size is a pointer to a null record. This also has the advantage of having a representation for &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;void*&lt;/code&gt;:

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Void {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (C, Void);
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Void_Ptr {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} {{Ada/kw|all}} Void;
 {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (C, Void_Ptr);

== Thin and Fat Access Types ==

The difference between an access type and an address will be detailed in the following. The term ''pointer'' is used because this is usual terminology.

There is a predefined unit &lt;code&gt;System.Address_to_Access_Conversion&lt;/code&gt; converting back and forth between access values and addresses. Use these conversions with care, as is explained below.

=== Thin Pointers ===

Thin pointers grant access to constrained subtypes.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Int     {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} -100 .. +500;
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Acc_Int {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Int;
 
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Arr     {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. 80) {{Ada/kw|of}} Character;
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Acc_Arr {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Arr;

Objects of subtypes like these have a static size, so a simple address suffices to access them. In the case of arrays, this is generally the address of the first element.

For pointers of this kind, use of &lt;code&gt;System.Address_to_Access_Conversion&lt;/code&gt; is safe.

=== Fat Pointers ===

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Unc     {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} &lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|of}} Character;
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Acc_Unc {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} Unc;

Objects of subtype &lt;code&gt;Unc&lt;/code&gt; need a constraint, i.e. a start and a stop index, thus pointers to them need also to include those. So a simple address like the one of the first component is not sufficient. Note that A'Address is the same as A(A'First)'Address for any array object.

For pointers of this kind, &lt;code&gt;System.Address_to_Access_Conversion&lt;/code&gt; will probably not work satisfactorily.

=== Example ===

 CO: {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Unc (-1 .. +1) := (-1 .. +1 =&gt; ' ');
 UO: {{Ada/kw|aliased}} Unc            := (-1 .. +1 =&gt; ' ');

Here, CO is a ''nominally constrained'' object, a pointer to it need not store the constraint, i.e. a thin pointer suffices. In contrast, UO is an object of a ''nominally unconstrained'' subtype, its ''actual subtype'' is constrained by the initial value.

 A: Acc_Unc            := CO'Access;  -- illegal
 B: Acc_Unc            := UO'Access;  -- OK
 C: Acc_Unc (CO'Range) := CO'Access;  -- also illegal

The relevant paragraphs in the RM are difficult to understand. In short words:

An access type's target type is called the ''designated subtype'', in our example &lt;code&gt;Unc&lt;/code&gt;. RM {{Ada/RM|3|10|2}}(27.1/2) requires that &lt;code&gt;Unc_Acc&lt;/code&gt;'s designated subtype statically match the ''nominal subtype'' of the object.

Now the nominal subtype of &lt;code&gt;CO&lt;/code&gt; is the constrained anonymous subtype &lt;code&gt;Unc (-1 .. +1)&lt;/code&gt;, the nominal subtype of &lt;code&gt;UO&lt;/code&gt; is the unconstrained subtype &lt;code&gt;Unc&lt;/code&gt;. In the illegal cases, the designated and nominal subtypes do not statically match.

__TOC__

== Description ==
R&lt;b&gt;'Size&lt;/b&gt; is a [[:Category:Ada Programming/Representation attributes|representation attribute]] used to get the number of bits of an object or type:
* When applied to an object, 'Size yields the actual number of bits allocated to store the object. 
* When applied to types, 'Size yields the ''minimum'' number of bits required to store an object of that type. 

Thus, the 'Size of a type might be lower than the 'Size of its objects. This is especially important to note for '''[[Ada Programming/Types/record#Variant_record|variant records]]''', where a particular instance of the record may be much larger than the smallest possible record instance.

The 'Size attribute may also be used to set the minimum size in bits used to store a type.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|attributes_size.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Attributes_Size {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
    {{Ada/kw|package}} I_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}}  Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO (Integer);
 
    A_Boolean : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Boolean := True;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Size of Boolean type   = &quot;); {{Ada/--|An enumeration with}}
    I_IO.Put (Boolean'Size);                {{Ada/--|2 values fits into}}
    T_IO.New_Line;                          {{Ada/--|1 bit.}}
 
    T_IO.Put (&quot;Size of Boolean Object = &quot;); {{Ada/--|it is more efficient}}
    I_IO.Put (A_Boolean'Size);              {{Ada/--|to store a boolean}}
    T_IO.New_Line;                          {{Ada/--|as an entire byte}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Attributes_Size;

The output with GNAT 3.4.1 will be:

 Size of Boolean type   =           1
 Size of Boolean Object =           8

Try it yourself and see how your compiler does.

==World History, Culture, and Geography: The Modern World==

Students in grade ten study '''major turning points''' that shaped the modern world, from the '''late eighteenth century through the present''', including the cause and course of the two world wars. They trace the rise of '''democratic ideas''' and develop an understanding of the '''historical roots of current world issues''', especially as they pertain to '''international relations'''. They extrapolate from the American experience that '''democratic ideals are often achieved at a high price, remain vulnerable, and are not practiced everywhere in the world'''. Students develop an understanding of current '''world issues''' and relate them to their '''historical, geographic, political, economic, and cultural contexts'''. Students consider '''multiple accounts of events''' in order to understand international relations from a '''variety of perspectives'''. 

====10.1 Students relate the '''moral and ethical principles''' in ancient '''Greek and Roman philosophy''', in '''Judaism''', and in '''Christianity''' to the development of '''Western political thought'''. ====

1. Analyze the similarities and differences in Judeo-Christian and Greco-Roman views of law, reason and faith, and duties of the individual.

2. Trace the development of the Western political ideas of the rule of law and illegiti-macy of tyranny, using selections from Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics.

3. Consider the influence of the U.S. Constitution on political systems in the contempo-rary world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a starter page for our major push to create an open content  
textbook that meets the California content standards for
10th grade World History.

'''[[COSTP World History Project|Go to contents of the California Open Source Textbook Project's K-12 World History Project]]'''

[[COSTP World History Project/California Content Standards|California Content Standards]]

----
[http://www.opensourcetext.org/ California Open Source Textbook Project] (COSTP)
COSTP began as a public/private undertaking; it was the first organization created to address the high cost, content range, and consistent shortages of K-12 textbooks in California.  The latter goal is currently  well on its way to being accomplished. COSTP has evolved over recent years to establish and spread the Open Textbook, Open Educational Resource (OER),  Open Courseware, and Open Education memes to K-12 and postsecondary educational institutions, worldwide. Many Open source textbook and courseware projects have started up since COSTP’s inception.   

COSTP's aim is to use California State K-12 Standards to develop open-licensed eBooks and printed textbooks that will be approved for adoption by California's State Board of Education for use in California public schools at far less cost than current commercial textbook offerings, thus helping the State of California save money (more than $200M per year) while providing more robust content for its public schools. 

In order for open source books to pass peer review (and thus approval for public school adoption) at the California State Board level (this is also true in most other states), textbook content must conform to the written state K-12 education framework standard, or it can be specially submitted to the Governor for approval.  This is a sine qua non for adoption; no exceptions are made.

The COSTP World History Project on Wikipedia was used a placeholder pilot that helped to prove the open source concept in the K-12 textbook sector. The COSTP World History Project was successful in helping California education officials understand - even in its current basic beginnings - the value of the open source content approach applied to K-12 textbooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''INPUT''' command is used to gather input from the user.  This section will attempt to teach you how to gather input upon request from the user.  For real-time input, see [[QBasic/Advanced Input]].

Here is the syntax of the input command:
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;INPUT &quot;[text to user]&quot;; [variable] ' Question mark added&lt;/source&gt;
or
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;INPUT &quot;[text to user]&quot;, [variable] ' No question mark added&lt;/source&gt;

Example:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
INPUT &quot;What is your name&quot;; name$
INPUT &quot;What is your age&quot;; age
&lt;/source&gt;

When a semicolon (;) is used after the text output to the user, a question mark (?) and 'space' are added to the output. When a comma (,) is used no question mark is added.

If a string is specified (eg 'name$'), anything the user enters before pressing the 'return' key will be accepted. 
If a numeric variable (eg 'age') is specified, the user must enter a number (if any non-numeric key is entered, the error message &quot;Redo from start&quot; will be output and the INPUT command rerun)

==6INPUT.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
CLS
INPUT &quot;What is your name&quot;; name$
PRINT &quot;Hello, &quot;; name$; &quot;! &quot;;
INPUT &quot;How old are you&quot;; age
PRINT &quot;The user, &quot;; name$; &quot; is &quot;; age; &quot; years old&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Please note:''' In the PRINT command, the (;) function ''concatenates'' (joins) the contents of the string variables with the text between the quotes (&quot; &quot;). Note the use of spaces so that the final printed text reads properly.

If a numerical variables is specified within the PRINT command, an additional space is automatically added both before and after the number.

'''See also:''' &lt;code&gt;LINE INPUT&lt;/code&gt; command to read a line of text from a file (and place the result in a string variable) or to input a series of variables (in which case any commas found will be treated as delimiters between fields).

Used to declare an '''interface'''. Interfaces are the most important innovation in Ada 2005. The basic semantic has been taken from the interface concept of the [[Wikipedia:Java programming language|Java programming language]]. Interface inheritance is a reduced form of [[Wikipedia:Multiple inheritance|multiple inheritance]].

== Interface types ==

There are various forms of interfaces available:

=== Normal interface ===

The normal interface is declared as:

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};

=== Limited interface ===

Can be used as interface to limited tagged type.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};

=== Synchronized interface ===

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|synchronized}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};

All synchronized interfaces are also limited.

=== Task interface ===

Can be used as an interface to a task type.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|task}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};

All task interfaces are also synchronized.

=== Protected interface ===

Can be used as an interface to a protected type.

  {{Ada/kw|type}} Printable {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|protected}} {{Ada/kw|interface}};

All protected interfaces are also synchronized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">G'day, thanks heaps for your edits to the quechua book. You seem to understand either quechua or phonetics (or both) far better than i. I would just like to know what happened to the bit on dipthongs, and how the table you put in relates to the oficial spelling changes approved by the Peruvian government in 1985 (which legilates 5 written vowels)? Another note, i started this book because i thought it was in desperate need of being written, not because i knew about anything on the subject. My main source (other than the wikipedia article) is a the lonley planet phrasebook, so please excuse my stupid questions, and bad phrasing of ideas. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 12:07, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:I haven't entered the Wikibooks site for ages, so sorry for being so late to answer. Quechua (unlike English) has no phonemic diphthongs (the phonetic diphthongs are phonemically merely semivocalic consonants juxtaposed to simple vowels; e.g., /aw/ = vowel /a/ followed by consontant /w/, while the English diphthong /aU/ as in &quot;how&quot; is a single, undecomposable phoneme). That's why they do not belong in a description of Quechua's phonemes (they would belong in a description of Quechua's phonotactics, i.e. syllable structure and such, which would also include the description of consonant clusters). As for the former practice of spelling with five vowels, that's due to the misinterpretation that Spanish speakers tend to make about Quechua's vowel phonology. Quechua has only three vowel phonemes, while Spanish has five. As in other languages with only 3 vowels (such as Arabic and Inuktitut), these feature a wide range of allophonic variation, meaning that phonetically one can actually hear sounds similar to [e] and [o] in Quechua, but that phonemically these are merely contextual and predictable realizations of /i/ and /u/ (basically, when they are next to an uvular consonant such as /q/). But to a Spanish speaker, used to thinking of the sounds [i] and [e] as belonging to what in Spanish are completely different phonemes /i/ and /e/, it is frequently difficult to grasp the idea that in some other language they may be considered as mere variants of &quot;the same sound&quot; (as they are for a native Quechua speaker). That is why in former orthographies devised by the educated elite in Peru (who were native speakers of Spanish), the Spanish distinction of /i/ vs. /e/ and /u/ vs. /o/ was artificially forced into Quechua orthography according to how the contextual allophone of /i/ and /u/ sounded to a Spanish ear. Imagine that English orthography had been devised by Quechua speakers; if so, then English consonant /k/ would be spelled differently in the words &quot;key&quot; and &quot;ski&quot;, because even though for a native English speaker it is clear that they have the same /k/ sound, to a Quechua speaker's ear they sound totally different (the former is aspirated like Quechua &quot;kh&quot; and the latter is unaspirated like Quechua &quot;k&quot;), so they would insist in spelling the two allophones of English /k/ differently according to what phoneme the sound would correspond to in Quechua, just like Spanish speakers insisted in spelling the two sounds of Quechua /i/ and of Quechua /u/ differently according to what phoneme the sound would correspond to in Spanish.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Uaxuctum. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Uaxuctum~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Setting Up Audacity ==

Before we can use Audacity, we need to install it.

=== Installation of Audacity ===

{{stub}}

=== MP3s and Audacity ===

To make MP3s, Audacity needs the LAME library installed. First we need to create LAME, then tell Audacity where it is. You can list all compatible files in /usr with the command
 find /usr |grep -E 'lib[^*]*lame[^*]*.so'
or your whole computer with
 find / | grep -E 'lib[^*]*lame[^*]*.so'
If you find a libmp3lame.so file (using Debian Sarge 3.1r1), just tell Audacity were it is (below).

Otherwise, you will need to make LAME first:

==== Install LAME ====

* Make sure that [[w:GNU|GNU]] [[w:make|make]] and [[w:gcc|gcc]] are installed. To do this, you can type '''make -v''' and '''gcc -v''' and make sure you don't get a &quot;command not found&quot; error. The -v option just prints the version.

* The LAME library is available from [http://lame.sourceforge.net]. Download the latest version from the [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=290&amp;package_id=309  file releases].

* The download is a [[w:tgz|.tar.gz]], you can use [[w:ark]] to extract the files into a folder.

* Go to the console
** In the Linspire menu this is ''L &gt; Programs &gt; Utilities &gt; Console''
** In Konquer press F4

* In the Console, type
 cd &quot;''&lt;directory&gt;''&quot;
replacing ''&lt;directory&gt;'' with the directoy LAME was extracted to; and press enter.
eg: ''' cd &quot;/home/user/lame&quot;

* Now type
 cd &quot;lame*&quot;
to go into a directory called something like &quot;lame-3.96.1&quot;. You can use '''cd &quot;lame-3.96.1&quot;''' instead. You may need to go deeper into the DIR,...so once again;

&lt;pre&gt;
cd lame*
&lt;/pre&gt;

such that you may end up here (or similar); ''/LAME/lame-3.96.1/lame-3.96.1''

Once you are able to type in;

&lt;pre&gt;
./configure --help
&lt;/pre&gt;

and get back an output of useful info, instead of a bash/shell error you know then you are in the correct DIR.
 

* LAME configures itself automatically - type dot slash configure and press enter:
 ./configure

* However; Please read either the INSTALL file, the README file, or review the ''./configure --help'' output (if more advanced) to determine your build options. I chose to include these ''--enable-mp3x'' and ''--enable-debug=norm''. Notice many options are defaulted to yes.

* When it returns to the command prompt you would type
 make
and press enter.

* LAME is now made in that directory, we'd like it installed into the system. This installation requires you to be root (super-user). If you are root (the prompt will be root@something# ) then type:
 make install
and press enter. If you aren't root, type:
 su -c &quot;make install&quot;
and press enter. Type the root password when asked (it will be invisible) and press enter.

==== Install to Audacity ====

When LAME is installed, we need to tell Audacity about it. The first time you go to export to an MP3 Audacity will ask you where libmp3lame.so is located. You can
simply point it to the libmp3lame.so file, normally in the '''/usr/local/lib''' folder, and click OK and you should be all set.

== Using Audacity ==

== Starting point ==
We must remember that these guides were created to help people pass the JLPT level 4 test. Work on the JLPT 4 test first, and then if you wish, go to level 3,2, and then 1.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:209.7.140.15|209.7.140.15]] ([[User talk:209.7.140.15|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/209.7.140.15|contribs]]) 09:56, 17 December 2004&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

: I'll have to disagree here. Not everyone comes to this book looking for basic stuff. Aside from that, this is a volunteer-based collaborative project. Just work on whatever you like and think is best. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:41, 11 April 2009 (UTC)

: Like Swift said, I think we should work on what we think is best.  These guides are not limited to the beginner level, but cover (or can cover) all levels. --[[Special:Contributions/211.120.119.94|211.120.119.94]] ([[User talk:211.120.119.94|talk]]) 01:41, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

== Categorization ==

I put this into [[:Category:Standard curricula]] because many other college admissions tests reside there as well and [[:Category:Standardized tests]] is pretty much empty and not worthy of a top-level category.  On [[JLPT Guide/About JLPT]] it states this test was a requirement for admission into Japanese colleges until 2003.  Thus, I feel [[:Category:Standard curricula]] is acceptable.  If there were an easy way to refile everything in Standard curricula in Standardized tests and then rename [[Subject:Standard curricula]] to [[Subject:Standardized tests]], it might be that the latter would be preferable. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:19, 1 May 2009 (UTC)

: There is a difference between a test and a curriculum. While JLPT certification is often used as a requirement for school and work, there is no openly published curriculum. There is even no official list of things to study. Only the test itself is standardised in the sense that scores should accurately reflect abilities,  and the evaluation is consistent over time.
: I see a use for both subjects. Both SATs and GREs are standardised tests, but there are also some books here on Wikibooks that are designed specifically to fit standard curricula (e.g. the South African Home Economics ... can't remember an actual example, but I can try to dig it up if you like). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:42, 5 May 2009 (UTC)

== Use of Japanese in describing test contents ==

On many of the pages, grammar terms and table headers are written in Japanese.  The focus of the test is learning Japanese, so this is understandable.  However, for N5 and N4 test takers, the focus of the test is on test contents -- not on learning more complicated kanji in order to learn what the test contents are.  Is it reasonable to use table headers like &quot;meaning&quot; instead of &quot;意味&quot;, particularly on N5 and N4 pages? [[User:Astrochicken|Astrochicken]] ([[User talk:Astrochicken|talk]]) 23:48, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

== Using ruby on kanji lists ==

In the kanji lists, I think we should use the following formatting
: {{furi|食べ物|たべもの}}
The following formatting is common for longer texts, but not so good for lists of kanji that already show the onyomi and kunyomi.
: {{furi|食|た}}べ{{furi|物|もの}}

The answer to how much someone would weigh on Saturn is incorrect.  A person would weigh more than 1.066 times their Earth weight on Saturn. [[User:207.191.200.118|207.191.200.118]] 02:20, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Saturn's mass is not the only factor involved. A factor of one over the square of Saturn's radius is also involved. The equation for the gravitional acceleration is g = M / r^2. The ratio between the gravitional accelerations for Earth and the cloud tops of Saturn is close to one. I also figured that the 1.066 figure would work if you were at Saturn's equator.

# It would be nice in the end of this section, wherein each of the techniques are described, to show pictures for each technique. For example, the backtracking discussion can show a tree, while the DP discussion can show a tree with colored branches where the same color represents redundantly solved subproblems. Similarly, DnC can be show in its own division tree. I think it's helpful to descirbe semantics with pictures, and it would just be another way to drive these points home.

===What You Will Learn===
:[NOTE: This is a final section of Chapter 1, to be placed in after the book has evolved enough to make the claim true.]
The primary aim of this book is to help you separate the wheat from the chaff from the large field of algorithms. The book is short enough so that it could be read over the course of one semester, primarily to encourage you to be aware of all of the topics we cover, and how they relate to each other. The comprehensive texts that we recommend in the preamble are useful when you encounter specific problems in software development or research, but often the key points can be lost in such a large treatment. Through the guidance of our own teachers we have beter learned what's important and what's not. This book is dedicated to those teachers.

:On note to massage into this: &quot;The books by (Knuth) and (CLRS) also separate the wheat from the chaff, but in another sense. These authors will literally review all of the technical literature available to find the best and most useful results and present them all in the same notational framework. Thus, part of the purpose they serve is to filter out unimportant results. While we whole-heartedly recommend these books as references it is a rare person who can read so fast or have enough spare time to read them cover-to-cover.&quot; [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 15:32, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC) (I'd like the end of chapter one to have the dedication, and not the qualification of &quot;Knuth is good... but&quot;, but it's an important point, I believe.)

''A routine for converting a single character to lower case is required''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not really true, and in fact most real-world ASCII tolower routines are written without a separate routine.  Here, the author is abstracting the character routine ahead of time, so that he can reuse the routine in a future function; a beginning programmer may think that they are expected to anticipate such abstractions before writing their code.  It may be more instructive to either explain the abstraction ahead of time (and not implying that it is obvious), or to leave the character routine within the string tolower function and refactor it out only after observing that the character comparision function shares the same functionality.  There should also probably be a note that these routines only apply to lower 128-bit ASCII encodings.

[[User:Jclee|Joe Lee]] 21:03, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:There's no reason at all that these apply to only 7-bit ASCII (for starters, it applies to many other encodings). The text itself allows for unicode (the comment &quot;These techniques depend upon the character encoding&quot; covers this quite well). Also, I think the quotes around &quot;obvious&quot; make it clear that it's not expected for someone to think of it immediately. But this is an advanced text and we should limit hand holding. If a programmer cannot reflect that an entire string needs to be read by a string handling routine, this book is probably too advanced for them. If anything, there is already too much hand holding, covering such a basic concept suitable to introductory programming students.

==Precomputing string lengths==
The book currently states &quot;''Note that for a pair of strings, it is also possible to have the length precomputed to avoid the second pass, but that can have its own drawbacks at times.''&quot;; however as far as I can tell, C and C++ are essentially the only programming languages that usually ''don't'' carry around string length data with the string, so I think that statement is misleading at best. -- [[User:Intgr|intgr]] 13:20, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A person can not be said to be fully mastering a language without being able to understand what other people are saying in that language. Listing ability of foreign language is a very important skill in learning a foreign language. Since there are a lot of contributors from all over the world in wiki, it’s possible to gather everyone’s effort to set up a Multilanguage Listening Tank for language learners. 

==How to help?==

It’s very easy to help if you are interested in this project. What you need to do is 1) find an appropriate material in that language, 2) record your voice when you read that. Since everyone speaks at least one language, everyone can make contribution. You don’t have to be a native speaker to make contribution to certain language. For example, if you are a native French speaker, you can still make effort in making English listening material. A master language learner should be able to understand when this language is spoken by non-native speakers.

==Material==

You can find articles in a certain language release in any copyleft license.

==Approaches==

There is a lot of forms of listening test for learners. You can simply make it as “multiplied choices”, “dictation”, “answer the question”.

==Record your voice==

Find appropriate software to record your voice.

==Level==

If you are a native speaker, mark that at the very first beginning of the listening material; if you are not a native speaker, mark that too, so that learner can decide what level it is.</text>

I concur on the cans, not so much the tent though i would go for a small bivy style one but its all just preference.  A spare mess kit, if it were to consist of a spare cooking pot/mess tin which could be used as a bowl, etc then i would be very much for that however if your suggesting taking two lots of cooking gear then again i concur that it could prove burdensome

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Kennedy and His Advisers=
As a Democrat, John F. Kennedy inherited the New Deal Commitment to America’s Social Welfare System. He generally cast liberal votes in line with the pro-labor sentiments of his low-income, blue collar constituents. Kennedy’s rhetoric and style captured the imagination of many Americans. Another attribute that made him more appealing was the fact that his advisers were mostly young and intellectual as well. Unfortunately though, Kennedy avoided controversial issues such as civil rights and the censure of Joseph McCarthy. 
From the beginning, Kennedy gave top priority to waging the Cold War. In the campaign he had criticized Eisenhower’s foreign policy as unimaginative, accusing him of missing chances to reduce the threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union and of weakening America’s standing in the Third World. Kennedy’s advisers had one thing going for them, and that was confidence. Kennedy, along with his advisers were firm in the sense that they were going to change things, and by doing so, they developed a multi-million dollar Alliance for Progress in 1961 to spur economic development in Latin America. In that same year the Peace Corps was also created. Critics later dismissed the Alliance and Peace Corps as Cold War tools by which Kennedy sought to counter anti-Americanism and defeat communism in the developing world. The programs didn’t have those aims, but both were recognized as being born of genuine humanitarianism. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., “A People and A Nation: A History of the United States; The Tumultuous Sixties; 1960-1968,” ed. Mary Beth Norton et al. (Boston: Cenage Learning 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

=Kennedy and Soviet-American Tensions=
Kennedy had little if any success in establishing relations with the Soviet Union. He met with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in June 1961. The meeting went poorly with both leaders; due to the fact that they were disagreeing over the preconditions for peace and stability in the world. Consequently, the administration’s first year witnessed little movement on controlling the nuclear arms race of even getting a superpower ban on testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere or underground. Instead, both superpowers continued testing and accelerated their arms production. In 1961, the U.S. military budget shot up 15%; by mid-1964, U.S. nuclear weapons had increased by 150%. Government advice to citizens was to build fallout shelters in their backyards and this only resulted in intensified public fear of devastating war. 
If war occurred, many believed it would be over the persistent problem of Berlin. In mid-1961, Khrushchev ratcheted up the tension by demanding an end to Western occupation of West Berlin and the reunification of East and West Germany. Kennedy stood his ground and remained committed to West Berlin and West Germany. In August the Soviets, at the urging of the East German Regime, erected a concrete and barbed wire barricade across the divided city to halt the exodus of East Germans into more prosperous and politically free West Berlin. 
The Berlin Wall inspired protests throughout the non-communist world, but Kennedy proclaimed that, “a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.” The ugly barrier shut off the flow of refugees, and crisis passed. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., “A People and A Nation: A History of the United States; The Tumultuous Sixites:1960-1968,” ed. Mary Beth Norton et al. (Boston: Cenage Learning 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis==
[[Image:John F Kennedy.jpg|thumb|right|John F. Kennedy]]
On April 17, 1961, President John F. Kennedy launched an attack on Cuba, using 1,500 CIA-trained Cuban exiles. The exiles were to invade Cuba through the Bay of Pigs in southwestern Cuba. The forces made many mistakes, and at the last moment, Kennedy was advised not to send air support, and he did not. The invasion was a complete failure and within days, Cuban forces crushed the U.S. troops. Kennedy never trusted military or intelligence advice again, and the Soviet Union concluded that Kennedy was a weak leader. The invasion also angered many Latin-American nations.

In 1962, the Soviet Union was desperately behind the United States in the arms race. Soviet missiles were only powerful enough to be launched against Europe but U.S. missiles were capable of striking the entire Soviet Union (missiles were located in Turkey).  In late April 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev conceived the idea of placing intermediate-range missiles in Cuba. A deployment in Cuba would double the Soviet strategic arsenal and provide a real deterrent to a potential U.S. attack against the Soviet Union.

Meanwhile, Fidel Castro was looking for a way to defend his island nation from an attack by the U.S. Ever since the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Castro felt a second attack was inevitable. Consequently, he approved of Khrushchev's plan to place missiles on the island. In the summer of 1962 the Soviet Union worked quickly and secretly to build its missile installations in Cuba.

The crisis began on October 15, 1962 when U-2 reconnaissance photographs revealed Soviet missiles under construction in Cuba. The next morning, Kennedy was informed of the missile installations.  Immediately the executive committee (EX-COMM) made up of twelve of his most important advisers was formed to handle the crisis. After seven days of guarded and intense debate, EX-COMM concluded that it had to impose a naval quarantine around Cuba, which would prevent the arrival of more Soviet offensive weapons on the island.

On October 22, Kennedy announced the discovery of the missile installations to the public and his decision to quarantine the island. He also proclaimed that any nuclear missile launched from Cuba would be regarded as an attack on the United States by the Soviet Union and demanded that the Soviets remove all of their offensive weapons from Cuba. It was at this time that the United States had warships that were on the Caribbean Sea and also had B-52's that were ready to with nuclear bombs flying in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 25th Kennedy pulled the quarantine line back and raised military readiness to DEFCON 2.

On the 26th EX-COMM heard from Khrushchev in an impassioned letter. He proposed the removing of Soviet missiles and personnel if the U.S. would guarantee not to invade Cuba.

October 27 was the worst day of the crisis. A U-2 was shot down over Cuba and EX-COMM received a second letter from Khrushchev demanding the removal of U.S. missiles in Turkey in exchange for Soviet missiles in Cuba. Attorney General Robert Kennedy suggested ignoring the second letter and contacted Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin to tell him of the U.S. agreement with the first.

Tensions finally began to ease on October 28 when Khrushchev announced that he would dismantle the installations and return the missiles to the Soviet Union, expressing his trust that the United States would not invade Cuba. Further negotiations were held to implement the October 28 agreement, including a United States demand that Soviet light bombers be removed from Cuba, and specifying the exact form and conditions of United States assurances not to invade Cuba.

==NASA==
NASA is a branch of the United States government, established by the [[w:National Aeronautics and Space Act|National Aeronautics and Space Act]] on July 29, 1958, during the Cold War, as a replacement of its predecessor, the [[w:National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA), as an instrument of geopolitics, responsible for the nation's civilian [[w:list of space agencies|space program]] and for aeronautics and aerospace research.

The USSR was ahead of the United States in the space race, in presence and technology.  After the launch of Sputnik and the success of Yuri Gagarin, America was behind in the Space Race. The United States would not allow this, and decided to implement their own space program. Eventually the United States became successful and landed two men on the moon. In May 1961, Alan Shepard Jr. became the first American to make a space flight. Kennedy lobbied for increased funding for space research. In an address to congress on May 25, 1961, Kennedy said, &quot;I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.&quot;

NASA's first high-profile human spaceflight program was Project Mercury, an effort to learn if humans could survive the rigors of spaceflight. On May 5, 1961, Alan B. Shepard, Jr. became the first American to fly into space, when he rode his Mercury capsule on a 15-minute suborbital mission. He launched from Complex 5 at Cape Canaveral aboard a Redstone rocket. His Freedom 7 capsule reached an altitude of 116 miles during this suborbital flight and splashed down some 304 miles out into the Atlantic. The six flights in the Mercury program concluded with Gordon Cooper's launch on May 15, 1963. John H. Glenn, Jr. became the first U.S. astronaut to orbit the Earth on February 20, 1962. With six flights, Project Mercury achieved its goal of putting piloted spacecraft into Earth orbit and retrieving the astronauts safely.

August 12, 1961, NASA announced that it intends to expand the Cape Canaveral facilities for manned lunar flight and other missions requiring advanced Saturn and Nova boosters by acquiring 80,000 acres of land north and west of the Air Force Missile Test Center facilities at the Cape. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was designated to act as real estate acquisition agent for NASA, and the Lands Division of the Justice Department was designated to handle the legal aspects.

July 1, 1962,  Dr. Kurt H. Debus was named director of the Launch Operations Center which later became the John F. Kennedy Space Center. Having supervised the development and construction of launch facilities at Cape Canaveral from 1952 to 1960 for the U.S. Army, he was the natural choice to direct the design, development and construction of NASA's Apollo/Saturn V facilities at KSC. He retired in November 1974, having been responsible for the launches conducted during the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs.
With the American space race against the Soviets came a lot of funding which then later brought jobs. America was in high pursuit to be the first country to reach the moon. Billions of dollars were spent on hiring many research workers and engineers to be able to put a man on the moon. The NASA program not necessarily helped the lower class people find work but for those who where educated it was quite a beneficial program.

==American Tragedy==

On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was at a campaign rally in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy and his wife rode through the streets in an open car, turning into Dealy Plaza at Houston and Elm, and suddenly several shots rang out. Kennedy fell against his wife. The car sped to the nearest hospital, Parkland Memorial, but it was too late; the beloved President was dead. Tears ran down the cheeks of CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite as he told the nation their president was dead. The word spread quickly, in whispered messages to classroom teachers, by  somber announcements in factories and offices. The nation was stunned. Shortly after, while on Air Force One, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office as President.

Although many &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; exist concerning this assassination, the rough consensus is that Kennedy's assailant, a young drifter and loner named Lee Harvey Oswald with left-wing sympathies, shot the President acting alone.
Lee Harvey Oswald was charged for the murders of Kennedy and Roy Truly a Dallas police officer. Owsald was first spotted three miles from the plaza in which he was called to the squad car of officer Trully, where he then panicked and shot Trully four times. Oswald was later arrested forty minutes later in a near by theater, and just two days later Oswald was shot dead in full view of millions of TV viewers.  Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1 pm.

==Americans in Vietnam==

Like Eisenhower, Kennedy had viewed Vietnam as a crucial battle in the fight against communism. He sent many special forces troops to South Vietnam to train South Vietnamese troops. Kennedy also put pressure on South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem to make political and economic reforms that would prevent communism from taking root in South Vietnam. After Diem refused to comply and restricted the rights of Buddhists (the majority religion in South Vietnam), he lost support, and a political coup ensued. Diem was assassinated on November 1, 1963.

In the month of February 1965, President Johnson ordered Operation Rolling Thunder to take place. It was ordered due to the Vietcong Attacks on American installations in South Vietnam which was responsible for the deaths of thirty-two Americans.  Operation Rolling Thunder was a bombing program that started in 1965 and continued on until October 1968.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the end of November, the United States had almost 15,000 troops in Vietnam as advisers. The U.S. sent the Secretary of Defense on a fact-finding mission to find if involvement was still needed in Vietnam. He concluded that the South Vietnamese could not hold off the Vietcong, or Vietnamese communists, without more American backing. In 1964, Johnson claimed that North Vietnamese patrol ships attacked American ships in the Gulf of Tonkin, and Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave the President broad control over troops in Vietnam.

In 1965, Johnson gradually built up the involvement of America in Vietnam. At the end of 1965, about 180,000 troops were in Vietnam. By 1967, there were over 500,000. The U.S. also began a bombing campaign in North Vietnam, and by 1968, more bombs had been dropped than the U.S. had dropped in World War II.

The Vietnam War became “Americanized” and the troop increase and Operation Rolling Thunder played part in doing so. Instead of the war being a civil war between North and South Vietnam it ended up becoming an American war against the communist government in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt; 


As Americans fought the war, frustration mounted. Soldiers had to fight through dense jungles and muddy land. It also seemed that for every Vietcong or North Vietnamese killed, many more would be replacements. The bombing campaign in the North actually heightened the morale of the North Vietnamese rather than lowering it, and the United States' losses increased. By the end of the decade, many outraged American citizens angrily opposed and protested the war. Opposition to the war was growing in the capital, too. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara no longer believed that the war could be won.

At home, protesters, especially college students, became increasingly bitter about the war. Others who tended to be older and more conservative, defended the war and sought to suppress the &quot;traitors.&quot;  This division between the young and the old became known as the '''generation gap'''. Officials at the University of California tried to limit recruiting efforts of protesters, and students were outraged. They held a protest that stopped the school for days. This type of protest spread across the nation, and many related ideas and activists became known collectively as the '''New Left'''.

Many of those who made up the New Left also made up the '''counterculture''', a movement that questioned basic American values and social customs. Parents found themselves increasingly disagreeing with their children. The counterculture was also expressed in pop culture, with many icons expressing the need for peace and reform.

Eventually, some adults came to resent the war. As adults began to disagree about the war more, they were called doves (those who wanted peace) and hawks (those who supported the war). Students also had a major gripe about the war: if the legal age to be drafted to go to war was eighteen, why was the legal voting age as high as twenty-one? Eventually, the twenty sixth amendment was passed in 1971, which met the demands of the students and lowered the legal voting age to 18.

Division in the country about the war became increasingly harsh and bitter. In October 1967, 50,000 people opposed to the war marched to the Pentagon in Washington D.C. to protest. Many students stuck flowers or other symbols of peace in the barrels of the guns held by those who guarded the pentagon. By the beginning of 1969, well over fifty percent of the nation opposed the war.

== President John F. Kennedy 1961-1963 ==
 
John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States. Of Irish descent, John was born May 29, 1917 in Brookline Massachusetts. John was married to Jacqueline Lee Kennedy. They had four children Arabella, Caroline, John Jr., and Patrick. President Kennedy took office January 20, 1961 and served till he was assassinated in November 22, 1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald. He was 46 when he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy is the only Catholic President we have ever had in the United States. President Kennedy was a Democratic and served in the United States House of Representatives before becoming President.
Graduating from Harvard in 1940, before becoming elected into the House of Representatives John Kennedy served in World War Two in the Navy. In 1943, when his PT boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety. After serving in the House of Representatives where he served three terms as a representative for Boston, Kennedy then became elected into the Senate in 1952. In 1955, while recuperating from a back operation, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history. In 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President, and four years later was a first-ballot nominee for President. Millions watched his television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation Eight Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Before President Kennedy left to fight in WWII he studied at Harvard University. He wrote a thesis in 1940 called Why England Slept which became a best seller. President Kennedy wrote again in 1956 and the piece was called Profiles in Courage which won the Pulitzer Prize.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kennedy, John F(itzgerald), (29 May 1917 – 22 Nov 1963).&quot; The Crystal Reference Encyclopedia. West Chiltington: Crystal Semantics, 2005. Credo Reference. Web. 16 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lyndon B. Johnson ==
Lyndon Baines Johnson (August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973), often referred to as LBJ, was a US politician who served as the 36th President of the United States (1963-1969) after his service as the 37th Vice President of the United States (1961-1963). He is one of four people who served in all four elected federal offices of the United States: Representative, Senator, Vice President and President.
Johnson, a Democrat, served as a United States Representative from Texas, from 1937–1949 and as United States Senator from 1949–1961, including six years as United States Senate Majority Leader, two as Senate Minority Leader and two as Senate Majority Whip. After campaigning unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1960, Johnson was asked by John F. Kennedy to be his running mate for the 1960 presidential election.

==The &quot;Great Society&quot; and Civil Rights Under Lyndon B. Johnson==

In January 1964, the new President Johnson made a series of proposals which he called the &quot;Great Society&quot; and began a &quot;war on poverty.&quot; He signed many programs into law that helped Americans in poverty, that is, those who do not make enough money to survive. During this time two of the most important programs signed into law were Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare provided cheap health insurance to senior citizens and Medicaid provided health insurance for the poor.The War on Poverty made much difference to the poor people living in America. It helped change and improve the way poor people were living in homes as well as changing and improving the health care that was being offered to them.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;   Cities and school also received boosts with the creation of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the signing of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.  

President Johnson's “Great Society” really helped change things in America during the 1960's. During his presidency Johnson took 45 domestic social programs and transformed that number to 435 programs. “The Great Society” was designed to help the people in America and it did just that; the poverty number in America changed from 22 percent of the population to 13 percent. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Great Society.&quot; The American Economy: A Historical Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2003. Credo Reference. Web. 16 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equal Rights===

Protests were growing in the 1960s. Blacks and whites in high schools and colleges in the South and the North staged sit-ins, protests that are accomplished by sitting down and not being productive or letting people pass. 

Another kind of protest was growing in the South. In 1961, groups of African Americans began riding buses from Washington D.C. that were bound for New Orleans to make sure that the Rosa Parks Supreme Court decision was being enforced. These bus riders were known as freedom riders. The rides went smoothly until the buses reached Alabama, where the freedom riders would be greeted with violence from angry whites. 

In the spring of 1963, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Martin Luther King Jr. targeted Birmingham, Alabama for segregation protests. Birmingham, a city in the deep South, was a hotbed for racism and segregation. City police arrested hundreds of protesters, as well as King himself, but protests continued. National television showed snarling dogs being set on the unarmed protesters and children being washed away on the impact of the water from fire hoses. As the nation watched in horror, President Kennedy announced a civil rights bill that would outlaw segregation nationwide.

On August 28, 1963, nationwide support for the civil rights bill boiled over. Over 200,000 people of all races and colors came to Washington D.C. to participate in a massive march organized by the SCLC and Mr. King. There, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, King read the words that would become one of history's greatest speeches:

&quot; '''I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.'...I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character...When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing...'Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!' '''&quot;

After Kennedy's death, Johnson, a firm believer in equal rights, promised that the bill would be signed into law. In the first July of Johnson's term, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law made discrimination illegal against African Americans in employment, public accommodations, and voting. The act not only protected African Americans, but it also prohibited discrimination by sex, religion, and ethnicity. It was followed in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act. The Voting Rights Act eliminated poll tax which is the 24th Amendment to the constitution, and literacy tests, therefore helping not just blacks, but all Americans gain equal rights. A very big tragedy stood out during the sixties. On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was killed.  Malcolm, who had to deal with watching his house burn to the ground as a child, later spoke out against the inequality against the blacks of this nation. He soon appealed to both black and white, as he continued to speak out against racial inequality. He continued to speak out until he was shot and killed, but no one knew who killed him, It may have possibly been the work of other black Muslims.

Martin Luther King Jr. was a very influential person during the sixties, maybe the most influential. He had preached on non-violent protest and had developed many followers, both black and white. He was put in jail several times, but managed to continue his preaching by writing a book. Martin Luther King Jr. was president of the Southern Christian Leadership Council. He and his followers organized numerous marches, rallies, and strikes to call attention to the systematic discrimination against minorities that was endemic in American society. His belief was in nonviolent confrontation with the authorities and a prodding of the conscience of the white majority to effect social change. He convinced President John F. Kennedy and later President Lyndon B. Johnson to push for legislation to end discrimination and was awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 1964. Although the deaths of Kennedy and Malcolm X were a huge deal, there was another huge tragedy in the sixties. On April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was killed. He was shot on the balcony of his motel room that he was staying at in Memphis, Tennessee.

===The Nation of Islam===
The Nation of Islam (&quot;NOI&quot;) was founded in Detroit, Michigan, by Wallace D. Fard Muhammad in July 1930. He set out to improve the spiritual, mental, social, and economic condition of the Black men and women of America. From 1934-1975, the NOI was led by Elijah Muhammad, who established businesses, large real estate holdings, armed forces and schools.[1] the Nation of Islam made lasting effects on blacks in the 1950’s and beyond. Their outspoken activist, Malcolm X,became a prominent minister and leader in the NOI. Before his assassination in 1965, he had moved to non-separatism and orthodox Sunni Islam after his experience of having made Hajj to Mecca. The Nation of Islam, referred to as Black Muslims, took factors of orthodox Islam to form a new sect. Originally the Nation preached segregation and hate towards white people. They said that the white man was cursed for eternity by Allah. Malcolm X often suggested complete separation of blacks and whites and thought that blacks should have their own land to live on separate from all whites. Under Malcolm X’s leadership the Nation grew from 500 members to as many as 30,000 to over 100,000 members in the early 60’s. They converted many famous black figures, most notably Muhammad Ali. The Nation offered a much more radical and less subservient message to oppressed blacks than Martin Luther King, Jr. did. Malcolm X’s most infamous words were “By any means necessary.” Just as the Nation of Islam had risen with the help of Malcolm X, so did they fall. In 1963, when Malcolm X found out about the morality problems of his prophet and idol, Elijah Muhammad, they began to separate. Malcolm X took notice of Elijah’s sexual relations with as many as six females of the Nation, an act which the Koran directly forbids. After Malcolm X made a highly criticized statement about John Kennedy’s death, Elijah took his opportunity to silence X. After this Malcolm X converted to orthodox Islam and parted ties with the Nation of Islam, crippling the amount of influence the Nation had on the world.

===A Second Tragedy===

On the morning of April 4, 1968, King was preparing to lead a march from the balcony of a hotel when shots rang out. Friends inside rushed outside to find King shot in the jaw.  The shooter was a sniper. Martin Luther King, Jr. was pronounced dead a few hours later. The nation was in complete shock.  There were many riots that happened throughout the country.  There were at least 110 cities throughout the United States that had violence the following day.  The worst riots happened in Chicago, Baltimore, and Washington D.C.  This was the largest domestic civil disturbance that has happened in the United States.  About 22,000 federal troops and 34,000 national guards were sent out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jofreeman.com/photos/Kingfuneral.html&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, rioting plagued America's streets as a profound sadness and anger gripped the nation. This would be one of many assassinations that would befall the country, including those of, Dr. Martin Luther King, Robert F. Kennedy, and Malcolm X.

Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21st, 1965 in Manhattans Audubon Ballroom.  It all started when a man ran up to Malcolm and shot him with a sawed off shotgun.  After that two other men charged Malcolm and shot him with pistols about sixteen times.  All three men were eventually caught and charged with murder.

===Pop Culture in the '60s===
While wars were being fought over race and democracy, a group of people in America stayed relatively unaffected by it: the rich.  The 1960’s provided a peak in American culture with movies, music, art and literature.  Possibly the climax of pop culture in the 1960’s was author Truman Capote’s Black and White Masquerade Party.  

Truman Capote was a critically acclaimed author and good friend to all the stars and socialites of the time.  Capote kept enough friends to fill an entire phone book, and almost all of them were rich, famous, and intriguing.  In 1966, coming off the success of his book, In Cold Blood, about a Kansas murder, Capote decided to throw a masquerade party.  Capote planned the party for over a year and developed one of the most select and exclusive guest lists.  With everyone wanting an invitation, Capote only handed out 500 invites to guests.  Guests were not allowed to bring uninvited escorts, so only the “who’s who” of people were allowed to attend.  Many stars felt spurned when they did not receive invitations.

On November 28th, 1966 the ball took place.  The guest list included Frank Sinatra, Andy Warhol, and Norman Mailer.  The party was a complete success.  The publicity that the ball received before the event was somehow exceeded by the publicity it received after.  It was immediately declared the party of the century, and all the stars raved about it.  In the years that followed the ball Capote’s popularity disintegrated, and posthumously he is remembered as much for the Black and White Ball itself as he is his writing career.
===The Stonewall Riots===
Perhaps aided by the Civil Rights Movement, or at least motivated by it, the Gay Rights Movement largely got its start in the early 1970s.  The first sign of gay people fighting for their rights as human beings started with the Stonewall Riots of 1969.  In New York City, after a gay bar was raided by the police, over a thousand gay people took a stand and began to revolt against the police.  It is not clear how the riot first started.  According to a veteran gay activist, the incident just involved a lot of people who all got angry at the same time.  The cops went into the bars and asked everyone for their identification.  Many people were being pushed out of the bars and into a paddy wagon.  Not sure how it started, the stonewall riot worked like a domino effect.  However it started, it ignited many others to fight for their rights against the police.&lt;ref&gt;http://socialistalternative.org/literature/stonewall.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Like many racial humans, the gays would go around and chant “gay power” throughout the streets.&lt;ref&gt;http://socialistalternative.org/literature/stonewall.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Throwing rocks and bottles at the police officers, the crowd chanted for gay rights.  After news of the riot spread, riots began happening across the nation for three days.  The Stonewall Riots are known as one of the most significant moments at the start of the Gay Rights Movement.

===Fact's and Figure in the '60s===

The sixties were an age of youth, as 70 million children from the baby boom became teenagers and young adults.  Trends shifted away from the conservative fifties and resulted in revolutionary ways of thinking and real changes in the cultural foundation of American life. Young people wanted change and the changes affected education, values, lifestyles, laws, and entertainment. All of the changes mentioned above were a major factor in the figures below.

* Population 177,830,000
* Unemployment 3,852,000
* National Debt 286.3 Billion
* Average Salary $4,743
* Teacher's Salary $5,174
* Minimum Wage $1.00
* Life Expectancy:  Males 66.6 years, Females 73.1 years
* Auto deaths 21.3 per 100,000

An estimated 850,000 &quot;war baby&quot; freshmen enter college; emergency living quarters are set up in dorm lounges, hotels and trailer camps.

In the 1960’s several music songs came into popularity like: “Cathy’s Clown,” “Spanish Harlem,” “Only the Lonely,” “Moon River,” “I Fall to Pieces,” “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” “Louie Louie,” “Hello Dolly,” “Satisfaction,” “Stop in the Name of Love,” “California Dreamin,” “Respect,” “Mrs. Robinson,” and “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In.”


Also, as times advanced throughout the 1960’s so did technology and numerous TV Shows: The Super Bowls, Star Trek, Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In, Sesame Street (premieres on PBS in 1969), The Smothers Brothers, and The Dick Van Dyke Show.


In the 1960s in the post war era automobiles production was increased a great deal. Of the cars that were produced among the most popular during the decade: Volkswagen bug, ’64 Ford Mustang, ’63 Corvette Sting Ray, Chevy Bel Air, ’64 Plymouth Barracuda, and ‘64 Pontiac GTO.


Also, during the 1960’s the society as a whole had a very free spirit way of thinking, and several fads broke in that included: face painting, wearing flowers in one’s hair, the Twist (hair-do), the jerk (dance), lava lamps, waterbeds, Day-Glo and black light, posters, and flashing the peace sign.

== Elections of the 1960s ==

The presidential election of 1960 featured a race of John F. Kennedy (Democrat) vs. Richard M. Nixon (Republican). Both candidates had similar political stances in believing they wanted a strong military front and both supported funding numerous welfare programs for the poor. Kennedy promised to lead Americans to a New Frontier. Kennedy ultimately won the election over Nixon by a narrow margin of electoral votes 303 to 219.

The presidential election of 1964 featured a race of Lyndon B. Johnson (Democrat) and Barry Goldwater (Arizona). Goldwater's brand of politics scared many Americans. He opposed civil rights, legislation, wanted to make Social Security voluntary, and proposed deep cuts in social programs. Johnson's slogan for the campaign was &quot;All the way with LBJ.&quot; Johnson won in a landslide of votes 486-52.

== The Women's Movement ==

In the year 1963, Betty Friedan fueled the fire for women's rights when she wrote her book called &quot;The Feminine Mystique.&quot; This book became unexpectedly popular among women. Friedan decided to tackle the problem that she called &quot;the problem with no name.&quot; This problem was the lack of education that middle-class wives and mothers received. These women looked at their homes and their lives and wondered if that was all life had to offer. Women across the country became more and more dissatisfied with their stay-at-home life. Friedan's approach was different than the typical argument for a women's movement, however, because she blamed the women for being unable to adjust to their role in the home rather than blaming society for creating that role for women.

The women's movement began an organized liberal group in 1966 called National Organization for Women, also known as NOW. This group was mainly comprised of educated and professional women. Since the EEOC was more focused on racial rights and discrimination, they did not pay much attention to gender discrimination. Because the rights of women was being ignored, NOW made it one of their main purposes to pressure the EEOC into hearing them out and enforcing their rights that were given to them in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Unfortunately, the EEOC basically considered NOW and the idea of women's rights to be a joke and even went as far as laughing at the idea when asked about it by a reporter. This made women in the work force that had to deal with discrimination, very angry. By 1970, NOW had more than 3,000 members across the nation. 

Women at this time craved social change and justice and became more radical. More and more women were noticing and getting fed up with being treated as second-class citizens. These women began to look beyond the roles that they were being forced into and looked at the roles that they willingly put themselves into. In 1968, a large group of women went to protest the Miss America Pageant that was being held in Atlantic City.  These women were against “degrading mindless-boob girlie symbol” that the beauty pageant represents and promotes. The women would take “enslavement” items such as: girdles, bras, high heels, and curlers, into the “Freedom Trashcan.” Even though nothing was actually burned, feminists of this time were consequently received the demeaning nickname “bra-burners.” 

The women who firmly believed in feminism and fought for women’s rights never really had a firm set of beliefs and many times used arguments on the opposite side of the board. On one side they argued that women were more sensitive than men and that this sensitivity would greatly improve every aspect of America including foreign diplomacy, government, businesses, and alike. They argued that men could not bring this quality to the table. However, on the other side, women argued that women and men were equal and therefore deserved equal treatment and that socially imposed roles were unfair. Charlotte Bunch, a feminist author, writes that “there is no private domain of a person’s life that is not political, and there is no political issue that is not ultimately personal.” They called this “personal politics” and many radical feminists jumped onboard with this idea very quickly. Women began “consciousness-raising” groups in order to discuss the fact that in their everyday lives, at work, and in the home, they were subordinated by men and how they lived in a highly patriarchal society. Women all across the country began these groups everywhere, in college dorms, churches, and suburban kitchens to discuss the topics of male dominance in work, healthcare, romance, marriage, sexuality, abortion, and family. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton, et al, &quot;A People and A Nation:Eighth Edition&quot;, 901-902&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">CORBA stands for Common Object Request Broker Architecture. The original idea was to create a single universal standard for how objects across different platforms, programming languages, network protocols can communicate with each other in a seamless manner. For example, an application developed on say a Sun Workstation running Unix under the programming language C needs to communicate by virtue of some well defined standard interface (the accepted contract) to a Intel based PC running Windows-2000 developed under Pascal. Without such a standard both sides need to negotiate all the details including the transport protocols.

The CORBA standard defines general interface standards that can be supported by different programming languages. In addition it also defines the quality and robustness of the communication, error handling, and recovery. The Standard does not cover implementation details, but only specifies the general interface language (IDL) used across all supported languages, exception handling specification, a special transport protocol called IOP that sits on top of TCP/IP, as well as the specific programming language mappings. Using the IDL, an implementation for the specific platform dependent object is generated which can be compiled using the supported language.

Since the Simplified Chinese is the domaint Chinese script in the world now, and not to make the learners confused, I think we should intial the Simplified Chinese lesson textbook first. Of course, a Traditional Chinese textbook is very necessary, but it's very easy to convert simpilified Chinese into traditional Chinese by softwares like Nanjixing or Miscosoft Office. I don't how many sentense patterns need to be taught. maybe we can find some other textbook as reference. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 12:38, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== hi...some questions ==

wow...this seems like an awesome undertaking...so all my comments are not designed to offend but rather to knowledgeify myself and hopefully raise some valid points:P

*what is the end goal of this project...i.e. how far do you guys (and me hopefully) plan to expand the lessons until? fluency? or just enough that one could get around in china w/out too much trouble? or are you guys going for 言文言. 

*the formating of the lessons...as most of them are incomplete atm. i just looked at lesson 1. it's quite good i might add :)... but from my experience teaching non-native speakers, it's VERY helpful to have the pin ying above the corresponding characters. now...for the tests i made for my students i had to do some funky spacing in ms word...is there a way to do that on wiki? or through a program? because most of the standard textbooks (whether for non-native speakers or for young children) have the pin ying above the characters to aid in pronounciation. for example, if a student sees 老师 enough times with lǎo shī above it, when the time comes for them to read w/out pin ying, they see 老师 and associate it with lǎo shī and thus are able to pronounce it. whereas if there is not the constant association, they have trouble recalling the pronounciation.

*the lessons (at least the ones i looked at 1, 2, and 7) seem a little fast paced. students like it when they can work through a lesson and they are left with a sense of accomplishment. from a non-native speaker's point of view, lesson 1 is a bit on the long and hard side...is it possible to restructure the lessons so we have more lessons but less content in each?

thanks for taking the time to read my points...i know i sound like an insufferable twit talking about &quot;my experiences&quot; and stuff...but i just want to help :) 
the answers to my queries may already be somewhere on the talks pages of the project...but i have trouble keeping track of 1 talk page...let alone dozens...so if the answers are already somewhere...could someone redirect me or fill me in? please and thank you...so for now...i await your replies...:)

[[User:ZeChinaman|ZeChinaman]] 17:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)



Edit: by hard lessons i meant the vocabulary...the conversations are fine...but the vocabulary is hard to take in one go...repetition in the lessons wouldn't hurt either. is it possible/practical to make the text bigger? i find that non-native speakers/readers have a hard time reading Unicode typed chinese. i can record/upload some sound files too...reading the sound upload guide atm....cheers :)

== Roadmap? ==

The roadmap on the main page is somewhat behind considering the lessons have already reached 8. Is there an updated, more current plan to the direction this book is going? [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 13:35, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Acca sellowiana Fruit MHNT Fronton.jpg|right|thumb|Feijoa.]]

The '''Feijoa''' or '''pineapple guava''' is an [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]-shaped [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] with a thin [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]]-green skin. The flesh inside is [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]-colored and encases a [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]]-like center. The texture is [[Cookbook:Grits|gritty]], close to that of a [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]]. The flesh tastes like a combination of several other fruits, usually described as [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]], [[Cookbook:Guava|guava]], and [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberry]]. Some people report a taste similar to that of a [[Cookbook:Quince|quince]] or [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]. Feijoa is native to [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South America]], but is now commercially grown in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]].

==Selection==
Select fruit that is fragrant and gives slightly to gentle pressure. Ripe feijoas are delicate, so take caution not to bruise the fruit. Imported feijoas are available from late March to June; while domestic ones reach the market in the fall. Feijoas are gaining in popularity and are becoming easier to find in supermarkets. They are already easy to find in speciality markets and can often be ordered out-of-season through several online merchants.

==Storage==
Ripe feijoas may be refrigerated, but they don’t have to be. Ripen feijoas in a paper bag at room temperature; to ripen quicker add an [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]] to the bag. Ripe feijoas normally last about 3 to 5 days. Feijoas may be frozen, but only if peeled and cooked into a [[Cookbook:Puree|purée]].

==Preparation==
Feijoas are most often eaten raw. The fruit is ripe when it is slightly soft and the jellied inner section is clear. The fruit is unripe when the jelly is white and is spoiled when the jelly is brown. Unfortunately, this test of ripeness may only be determined once the fruit is opened. Peel the fruit before preparing, as the skin is bitter.</text>

The term '''skate''' is used in Britain to describe almost any member of the ray family or Rajidae; especially the genus Raja. They have flat pectoral fins continuous with their head, two dorsal fins and a short, spineless tail.

In the kitchen, two parts of the skate are cooked as food. '''Skate wings''' are the pectoral fins. When skinned, they take the form of a sheet of cartilage separating two layers of fibred flesh. The wings can be cooked in a variety of ways. The simplest is to dust the wing on both sides with [[Cookbook:Seasoned flour|seasoned flour]] and shallow [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] fairly quickly. They can also be [[Cookbook:Poaching|poached]] in a [[Cookbook:Court-bouillon|court-bouillon]]. To eat, scrape the flesh off the cartilage with a knife and fork. Skate wings are often served with a [[Cookbook:Caper|caper]] sauce.

Less commonly seen are '''skate knobs'''. Stop giggling. These are balls of flesh from the cheeks of the fish. They are easily and quickly cooked by shallow frying. You can also coat them in [[Cookbook:Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]] before cooking. Overcome any qualms you have, because they are very tasty.

'''Seasoned flour''' is [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] that has been flavoured with a small amount of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], and sometimes other ingredients like grated lemon peel, or other spices. It is generally used as a light coating for meat and fish that is intended to be [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]].</text>

'''Albanian vegetable pie''', '''''Byrek Shqipëtar me perime''''', is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Albania|Albania]]n recipe for cooking pies. Albanian pies are generally made of thin pastry leaves which can be rolled out at home or bought as [[Cookbook:Filo Dough|filo dough]] at a supermarket. Most of the pies prepared by Albanian cooks are not sweet; instead, pie fillings are almost always savory. Thus, a piece of such a pie may well serve as the main dish of a meal.

== Ingredients ==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (240 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]], preferably [[Cookbook:Olive_Oil|olive oil]]
*1½ packets (or about 30) pastry leaves (filo dough)
*1½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] (680 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) spinach, chopped
*1 cup (240 mL) diced [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|feta cheese]]
*½ cup (120 mL) chopped green [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
*2-3 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] (7.5 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==
A medium-sized, round baking pan is recommended because it's more authentic, but any medium-sized baking pan will do.

Brush the baking pan with some of the oil, and start laying the pastry leaves inside. First, lay two leaves, sprinkle or brush with oil, then lay two more leaves, and repeat the procedure until half of the leaves are in place. Make sure that they cover the pan by hanging them about one inch over the edges of the pan.

Sprinkle spinach with salt, then mix well by hand. Add the feta cheese, oil, onions, eggs and salt, and spread this mixture over the already laid pastry leaves. Finish by covering the spinach with the rest of the pastry leaves, repeating the first-half procedure and then roll the hanging edges of the bottom leaves over the pie (think of a [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] crust), sprinkle top with oil and bake moderately at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|350°F (175°C)]] for about 45 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve hot, accompanied with [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]], or beaten [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]], thinned down in cold water or with chilled [[Cookbook:Stewed Prunes|stewed prunes]]. Sometimes a green [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]] adds to the meal!

Serves 4-6.

[[Image:ElectoralCollege1988-Large.png|420px|right|thumb|Electoral College 1988]]
Having been badly defeated in the 1984 presidential election, the Democrats were eager to find a new approach to win the presidency. They felt more optimistic this time due to the large gains in the 1986 mid-term election which resulted in the Democrats taking back control of the Senate after 6 years of Republican rule. Among the field of candidates were the following:

* [[w:Bruce E. Babbitt|Bruce E. Babbitt]], former governor of Arizona
* [[w:Joseph Biden Jr.|Joseph R. Biden Jr.]], U.S. senator from Delaware
* [[w:Michael Dukakis|Michael S. Dukakis]], governor of Massachusetts
* [[w:Dick Gephardt|Richard A. &quot;Dick&quot; Gephardt]], U.S. representative from Missouri
* [[w:Al Gore|Albert A. Gore Jr.]], U.S. senator from Tennessee
* [[w:Gary W. Hart|Gary W. Hart]], former U.S. senator from Colorado
* [[w:Rev. Jesse Jackson|Rev. Jesse L. Jackson]], civil rights activist
* [[w:Paul M. Simon|Paul M. Simon]], U.S. senator from Illinois
* [[w:Patricia Schroeder|Patricia Schroeder]], Senator from Colorado



[[Image:George H. W. Bush, President of the United States, official portrait.jpg|thumb|left|150px|George H. W. Bush]]

Reagan's Vice President, George Herbert Walker Bush, easily defeated Senator [[w:Bob Dole|Bob Dole]] of Kansas and televangelist [[w:Pat Robertson|Pat Robertson]] for the Republican presidential nomination.  Dole, at first, had a significant lead in polls.  Bush selected Senator [[w:Dan Quayle|James Danforth (Dan) Quayle]] of Indiana to be his running mate.  The Democrats, after an exhausting primary season, selected Governor [[w:Michael Dukakis|Michael Dukakis]] of Massachusetts as their nominee.  The 1988 election was the first time television was used as the primary method of voter mobilization.

During his acceptance speech for the Republican party nomination, Bush said, famously, &quot;[[w:Read my lips: no new taxes|Read my lips: no new taxes]].&quot;  Bush assailed his opponent for being soft on crime and insinuated that he lacked patriotism.  Specifically, he criticized his unconditional opposition to the death penalty, and his opposition to the proposed law that would require students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.  He also blamed Dukakis for the pollution in Boston harbor.  Dukakis lacked experience in national politics and failed to effectively counter Bush's assaults.

Bush won the election with 48.9 million votes (53.4%) against Dukakis's 41.8 million.  He carried 40 states and won in the Electoral College 426 votes to 112.

The campaign's harsh tone repelled voters. It was described as the nastiest election in modern times. Voter turnout was the lowest since 1924.

== Social Changes of the 1990s ==

The population continued to grow to over 250 million by 1990.  The total had nearly quadrupled in a century and was more than double the population during the first election of Franklin Roosevelt.  Medical advances brought the life expectancy to a record high.  The Hispanic population grew five times as fast as the rest of the population and began to emerge as a political force.

Left-over changes from the countercultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s were apparent.  &quot;Laid-back&quot; attitudes toward dress, language, and sexual freedom were among these left-over changes.  A new tolerance was especially prevalent in what had been historically the most sensitive of all problems for Americans - sex.  Ninety-five percent of males and over 80 percent of females between 18 and 24 acknowledged premarital intercourse.

Drugs remained popular as well.  While LSD fell out of fashion, marijuana remained popular.  &quot;Crack,&quot; a cheap and powerful derivative of cocaine, displaced heroin.

The rise of the Moral Majority continued - dismay over crimes, drugs, and drinking was widespread.  States raised the drinking age and cracked down on drunk driving.  The people revolted against cigarette smoking, and many states and communities began to ban smoking in public places.

The campaign against sexual promiscuity received unexpected support due to the discovery of AIDS.Most politicians were slow to devote resources to combating AIDS, in part because it was initially  perceived as a &quot;gay mans disease&quot; which did not threaten other Americans.

Generation X is the name given to people born between the 1960’s up to 1982.  The term was penned by author Douglas Coupland in 1991 when he released his era defining Generation X.  Coupland wrote of mid-twenty characters who were going through “quarter-life crisis.”  In the book Coupland discussed how his generation faced looming threats of nuclear war which made forming meaningful relationships meaningless.  He also discussed how major corporations such as McDonald’s provided a shared state of consumerism which formed a new zone of comfort.  By pointing out major social problems such as AIDS, depression, and sexuality Coupland helped define an entire generation.

== The World Changes ==

The universal oppression in Communist nations and the failure of Communist economies led to growing disenchantment with Communism.  Communist regimes began collapsing across the world.  Under Mikhail Gorbachev, head of the Communist Party and later President of the USSR, the Soviet Union began to crumble.  He was unable to prevent the secession of the Baltic states, and communist hard-liners led an unsuccessful coup that nonetheless demonstrated the loss of most of Gorbachev's stature. Boris Yeltsin, a leader in the resistance against the coup, later became president of the Russian Federation. The Soviet parliament soon adjourned forever, and Gorbachev resigned.  The world was at last free of the Cold War.

With the Soviet Union out of Central America and the neutralization of Castro due to the Union's demise, Bush was slowly able to advance American objectives in that region.

The decline of the Soviet Union also left the United States with increased influence in the Middle East.  Bush was eager to serve peace by persuading Israel to return the Arab lands it seized in 1967.  The Administration was also committed to sustaining the flow of inexpensive oil from the Persian Gulf.

===Desert Shield===

Under Saddam Hussein, Iraqi forces invaded and quickly gained control of Kuwait on August 2, 1990.  Bush immediately denounced the invasion as &quot;naked aggression&quot; and banned trade with Iraq, froze all Iraqi assets within the United States, and dispatched an aircraft-carrier group to the Persian Gulf.  The UN Security Council unanimously condemned the invasion and demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.  On August 15, with the first American soldiers on their way to the Persian Gulf, Bush told Americans that Operation Desert Shield was under way to protect &quot;access to energy resources&quot; and thus &quot;our jobs, our way of life.&quot;  Most Americans supported the war.  American troops began to build up in Saudi Arabia.  On November 29 the Security Council authorized the use of &quot;all necessary means&quot; to expel Iraqi troops if they had not left Kuwait by January 15, 1991.  Bush was assailed by the media and Democrats for sending 400,000 troops to the Persian Gulf without consulting Congress, for making war seem unavoidable, and for creating crisis in order to draw attention from the faltering economy.

On January 12, 1991, in a largely partisan vote, both chambers - the House 250 to 183, the Senate 53 to 46 - authorized Bush &quot;to use United States armed forces&quot; pursuant to the UN Security Council resolution.

===Operation Desert Storm===

The U.S. and its coalition overwhelmed its enemy.  From the start, the coalition had total command of the air.  Within days, Iraqi communication systems, air bases, and antiaircraft defenses were obliterated by aircraft.  Americans were quickly attacking strategic targets - power plants, bridges, and chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons facilities.  From day eight, coalitions planes devastated the Iraqi army.  On the second day, Hussein fired Scud missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia, but none caused major damage.  In late January the Iraqi release of thousands of gallons of Kuwaiti oil into the Persian Gulf polluted the waters of that area.

[[Image:USAF_F-16A_F-15C_F-15E_Desert_Storm_pic.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Bombers fly over burning oil wells during Desert Storm]]
Bush warned Hussein that the coalition would force him out if he had not begun withdrawal by February 24.  Coalition forces placed Iraqi forces in a squeeze they could not escape.  After 100 hours of ground warfare, Kuwait had been liberated, and the Baghdad area was besieged.  The coalition had destroyed some 4,000 Iraqi tanks, more than 1,000 armored vehicles, and about 3,000 artillery pieces.  In comparison, the coalition had lost only 4 tanks, 9 other vehicles, and 1 cannon.  About 100,000 Iraqi troops were killed, and the coalition had suffered less than 200 deaths.

However, Saddam was still in control.  Soon after the cease-fire, the Iraqi army put down a Shiite rebellion and forced Kurds in Iraq to flee to Iran and Turkey.  United Nations inspections began.  The media did little to inform Americans about the destruction of the Iraqi infrastructure, the foundation of a modernizing society, or about the millions of people left without electricity, running water, or sewage.
Another concern was Hussein might also have wanted to invade Saudi Arabia.  This was a huge concern because of the rich oil in Saudi Arabia.  This would have given Hussein a huge and valuable resource for his army.  The collaboration with Saudi Arabia and the United States made Hussein very angry.  He thought it as cowardly.

===Back to Usual Politics===

Bush was closely aligned to Ronald Reagan in regard to social issues after his two terms as vice-president. As a Republican congressman from Texas, he was pro-choice, but when he ran for president, he opposed abortion, and he endorsed Supreme Court decisions weakening affirmative action in hiring and promotion.  He consistently tried to make appointments to federal courts of judges that shared his own views about the First Amendment, abortion, and affirmative action.  Bush named David Souter to replace Justice William Brennan on the Supreme Court, and he named Clarence Thomas to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall.

Bush called himself &quot;the education president&quot; and &quot;the environment president.&quot;  Bush called for a controversial program that would allow public money to follow children to public schools but it was not acted upon.  Bush appointed performed and committed conservationists to the Environmental Protection Agency.  At times he would take the side of business, and at other times he would take the side of ecologists.  In 1989 he signed a law to ease the effects of acid rain, mandating a gradual 50 percent reduction in sulfur emissions from power plants burning coal, and it also required the automobile industry to increase gradually the production of cars using fuels other than gasoline or diesel oil.  In 1991, Bush put forward an energy plan to open for exploration the Arctic Wildlife Refuge, some other Alaskan areas, and the continental shelf off the coasts of California and the Gulf of Mexico.

During 1989, economic growth in the United States slowed, and by the second half of 1990, most economists considered the economy in recession.  Bush again proposed, as he had in 1989, lowering the capital gains tax, but Congressional Democrats balked.  During talks, the White House backed down on capital gains and the two sides agreed on a budget package that included a steep increase in excise taxes, a small increase in Medicare charges, and a cut in Medicare spending.  However, members of both parties in Congress rejected the solution.  Finally, on October 29, 1991, the Congress at last approved an acceptable compromise.  It lifted the top surtax rate from 28 to 31 percent, gradually phased out income-tax exemptions for upper-income taxpayers, and raised the tax on gasoline, cigarettes, and beer.  It also imposed a luxury tax on expensive automobiles, boats, furs, and jewelry, and raised Medicare premiums.  The Democrats committed Congress for five years to reduce expenditures both for the military and domestically.  After the quick victory in the Persian Gulf, the administration anticipated a quick return of national growth, but the GNP did not pick up.  Unemployment reached a four year high.

== The Election of 1992 ==

As the election campaign of 1992 began, the incumbent President, George Bush, held a commanding lead in the polls, over any and all potential rivals. Bush had been the Commander- In -Chief presiding over the most decisive American military victory since World War II, the Gulf War. Most of the leading democratic candidates declined to run. After a long primary process Bill Clinton, the then governor of Arkansas, was selected as the Democratic candidate.

Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas became the apparent leader among the Democratic candidates for the 1992 election.  By late April, Clinton had a commanding lead and delegates and was running evenly with Bush in public opinion polls.  Rioting in central Los Angeles arose following the verdict of a suburban jury that found Los Angeles policemen not guilty of using undue force in beating a black motorist they had arrested.

From the time of the Democratic convention, Governor Clinton obtained a commanding lead in the polls over Bush. Bush's campaign was hobbled by troubled economy. The campaign revolved primarily around economic issues. The end of the cold war, which the Republicans took credit for, perversely worked against them. No longer could they use the issue of &quot;Do you trust the Democrats to stand up to the Russians&quot; against them. The third party candidacy of Ross Perot was a true wild card in the campaign. 

[[Image:ElectoralCollege1992-Large.png|thumb|400px]]
The polls showed extreme disenchantment with both candidates, and [[w:H. Ross Perot|H. Ross Perot]], a Texas billionaire, organized a run as a Reform Party nominee.  Perot appealed to conservatives by speaking out against taxes, deficits, and adultery, but he was pro-choice and had a tolerant attitude toward homosexuality.  He also appealed to traditionally Democratic voters by being an outspoken opponent of [[w:NAFTA|NAFTA]] (a free-trade agreement). He remained evasive about his economic and social agenda, and becoming uncomfortable with the probings of the media, he withdrew from the election, only to return in October.  Perot's entrance into the race reflected the impatience of the electorate with politics and their dissatisfaction with the major parties. Perot was also able to gain such a level of support because he was allowed to participate in all three Presidential debates. Incumbents at every level were worried, and an unprecedented number of members of Congress chose not to seek reelection.  Bush and Quayle stressed &quot;family values.&quot;  Bush called for across-the-board tax cuts, and public opinion polls revealed the closeness of the race.

The Clinton camp began to use the famous slogan &quot;It's the economy, stupid!&quot; and he was successful in presenting his theme of change.  Clinton won an overwhelming majority in the Electoral College (370 to 168) but received only 43 percent of the popular vote.

== William Jefferson Clinton ==

[[image:Bill_Clinton.jpg|right|thumb|200px|William Jefferson Clinton]]
President of the United States of America. William Jefferson Clinton was born on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas, a small town with a population of about 8,000. His father, William Jefferson Blythe, died in a car crash several months before Clinton was born, leaving him in the care of his mother, Virginia Cassidy Blythe. In order to provide for her son, Virginia moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, to complete two years of nursing school, while Clinton stayed with his grandparents, Eldridge and Edith Cassidy. Clinton's grandparents were strict disciplinarians who instilled in him the importance of a good education. &quot;My grandparents had a lot to do with my early commitment to learning,&quot; he later recalled. &quot;They taught me to count and read. I was reading little books when I was three.&quot;


[[w:William Jefferson Clinton|William Jefferson Clinton]] became the 42nd President of the United States in 1992, signaling a generational change. He was the first Democrat in over 50 years to win a second term and presided over the longest peace time economic expansion in history. He was an activist, progressive president (of a breed of politicians which he called the &quot;New Democrats&quot;) who stayed constantly surrounded by controversy. 

Bill Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe in Hope, Arkansas and was raised in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 1950, Clinton's mother remarried to Roger Clinton, Clinton's natural father having been killed in an automobile accident, three months before his son's birth. Roger Clinton was an alcoholic gambler who would beat his wife and Clinton's half-brother also named Roger.

===Clinton's Domestic Agenda===

Clinton had a very progressive agenda, which included ending the recession of the early 90s, health care reforms, and domestic reforms. Clinton, working with the Republican Congress, helped narrow the deficit by cutting spending and increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans. On the issue of health care, Clinton wanted to stop the rising costs of health care and provide the estimated 39 million uninsured Americans with health insurance. He created a task force, headed by his wife, [[w:Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]], to deal with the problem, but critics attacked the plan. They worried that the plan was too expensive and too complicated. Congress would never vote on Clinton's plan, and his health care effort would die.

Clinton was able to succeed in other efforts, though. Despite opposition, Clinton was able to pass the [[w:Brady Bill|Brady Bill]] (named after [[w:James Brady|James Brady]], who was crippled after being shot in the Ronald Reagan assassination attempt), which created a mandatory waiting period in which gun vendors could check a buyer's criminal background before a buyer could recieve his gun. A 1994 crime bill complemented the bill by banning 19 kinds of assault weapons and creating 100,000 new police jobs.

Clinton was also able to push Congress to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), despite strong opposition from labor unions (which, ironically, are the strongest source of Democrat support). The agreement would provide lower costs for consumers in many markets, due to increased trading with Mexico and Canada.
====The Third Way====
Clinton is a supporter of the Third Way, or Radical center, a centrist political philosophy of governance that embraces a mix of market and interventionist philosophies. The Third Way rejects both socialism and laissez-faire approaches to economic governance, but chiefly stresses technological development, education, and competitive mechanisms to pursue economic progress and governmental objectives. Third way philosophies have been described as a synthesis of capitalism and socialism by its proponents.

In the United States, Third Way adherents emphasize fiscal conservatism, some replacement of welfare with workfare, and a stronger preference for market solutions to traditional problems (as in pollution markets), while rejecting pure laissez-faire economics and other libertarian positions. The Third Way style of governing was firmly adopted and partly redefined during the Administration of President Bill Clinton.

After Tony Blair came to power in the UK, Clinton, Blair and other leading Third Way adherents organized conferences to promote the Third Way in 1997 at Chequers in England. The Democratic Leadership Council are adherents of Third Way politics.

In 2004, several veteran U.S. Democrats founded a new Washington, DC organization entitled Third Way, which bills itself as a &quot;strategy center for progressives.&quot; John Kerry of 2004 U.S. Democrats Presidential candidate is also considered to be third way politician, as are 2008 U.S. Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

===Keeping Peace===

During the Clinton administration, keeping peace in other parts of the world was a priority. When the President of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was overthrown by violent dictators, Clinton sent troops to Haiti to pressure the new dictators to step down and to help slow the tidal wave of Hatian refugees fleeing to Florida. They did step down, and Aristide's power was restored.

Another challenge to peace was a bloody civil war that had erupted in Yugoslavia, part of the Balkan peninsula in Europe. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, and Croatia all declared independence from Yugoslavia, but many Serbs (from Serbia, a part of Yugoslavia) still lived in those areas, and Yugoslavia fought to hold onto parts of Bosnia and Croatia. As America became aware of the atrocities of the war, Clinton arranged peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, and the Serbs, the Croats, and the Bosnians signed a peace agreement in December 1995. Eventually, another conflict would arise in the region during Clinton's second term.

===1994 Midterm Elections===

During the 1994 midterm Congressional elections, Republicans presented a plan called the &quot;Contract with America.&quot;  The contract detailed the actions Republicans would take upon becoming the majority party in Congress.  This charge was led by Newt Gingrich.  The GOP plan was a success, winning the Republicans a majority in the House for the first time in 40 years, and a Republican majority in the Senate.  The massive success became known as the Republican Revolution.

In retrospect, the Republicans' dramatically large gains can be attributed to many things. A larger than average number of incumbents retired, and thus there was a larger number of open seat races, which are far easier to switch parties. Additionally, the previously Democratic-controlled House had been plagued by a [[w:House banking scandal|scandal]] since before the 1992 election. The scandal implicated far more Democrats than Republicans and can in part be blamed for the large number of open seats. Historians and political scientists also point to President Clinton's resounding failure to pass his [[w:Clinton health care plan|universal healthcare plan]] in a Democratic-controlled congress. The plan had been a large part of his 1992 campaign and was to be the cornerstone of his first-term agenda. The defeat likely demoralized Democratic voters, who ended up turning out in low numbers.

===1996 Election===

Clinton easily won Democratic renomination in 1996. His opponent was Kansas senator Bob Dole, who had served in Congress since 1961. Dole claimed that he could lower taxes by 15 percent and that Clinton was an unethical president. Clinton said that Dole would ruin the environment and reverse the progress that Clinton had made with medicare. Ross Perot ran again, and relying on infomercials, also claimed that Clinton was unethical. 

Despite it all, Clinton won the election in a landslide, while Perot received a much smaller amount of votes than he did in the 1992 election. Even though the Democratic campaign for the presidency was successful, they didn't fare well in the congressional elections. Republicans gained 2 seats in the Senate, giving them a 55-45 majority. Even though Democrats gained 11 seats in the House, Republicans still held a 226-207 majority. Independents held two seats. Republicans had total control of Congress.

===Conflict in Kosovo===

After 1995, it seemed that things would stay relatively quiet in the Balkans. But a series of events would lead to rampant political instability within Yugoslavia and eventually a civil war. Kosovo, a province of Serbia (which was a part of Yugoslavia) was home to a large number of Albanians (from the neighboring Albania), who were actually the ethnic majority in the area. In the late eighties and early nineties, the Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic passed laws that eliminated Kosovo's constitutional rights and opressed Albanians. In 1991, Kosovo voted to break away from Yugoslavia. Although Yugoslavia claimed that the vote was illegal, things in the area stayed relatively quiet until April 1996, when a mysterious organization known as the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) began attacking Serbian civilians.

Eventually, the attacks on civilians caused hundreds of thousands of people to flee Kosovo. Serbians viewed the KLA as a group of terrorists, and retaliated. As the violence became bloodier and bloodier, more and more refugees began to flee into Macedonia, and tensions between the refugee Albanians and the native Macedonian Slavs grew, and a possible civil war loomed. A civil war in Macedonia would have been catastrophic to the already damaged stability and security of the area, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization concluded that intervention was needed.

A coalition of NATO members, headed by the United States, began a bombing campaign on March 24, 1999. The goal of the campaign was to force the Serbs to leave Kosovo so that the Albanian refugees could return to their homes. Initially, the bombing caused a mass Albanian exodus from Kosovo, with the U.N. reporting that over 850,000 Albanians had fled from Kosovo to Albania or Macedonia. Milosevic would not step down until June, when Finnish and Russian negotiators convinced him that NATO was serious in its goal and that Russia (a long time protector of Slavic people) would not step in to protect Yugoslavia. On June 10, the bombings ended, and an occupation of the area by U.N. and NATO peacekeeping troops began. Kosovo lay in ruins and hundreds of thousands of people were displaced.

===Oklahoma City Bombing===

At 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, a truck bomb exploded near the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City, pulverizing nearly the entire north face of the 9-story building into dust and rubble. It took weeks of sorting through debris to find the victims. 168 people were killed, including 19 children, as the building housed a day-care center. This was the deadliest act of terrorism on US soil until September 11, 2001. 

Although militant groups based in the Middle East were initially seen as the likely perpetrators, a native-born white American named Timothy McVeigh was soon arrested and charged with the crime. McVeigh, a veteran of the Persian Gulf War, would subsequently be put on trial and sentenced to death. Also implicated in the crime was McVeigh's army friend Terry Nichols, who was convicted in a separate trial and sentenced to life in prison. The attack was said to be motivated in part by the siege in Waco, Texas, which culminated in a fire which killed 80 Branch Davidians on April 19, 1993. This was said to be McVeigh's reason for attacking on April 19. 

In September 1994, McVeigh purchased large amounts of fertilizer (ammonium nitrate) and then stored it in a rented shed in Herington, Kansas. The ammonium nitrate was the main ingredient for the bomb. McVeigh and Nichols reportedly stole other supplies needed to complete the bomb from a quarry in Marion, Kansas.

On April 17, 1995, McVeigh reportedly rented a Ryder truck, and on the following day he and Nichols reportedly loaded the Ryder truck with approximately 5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer. McVeigh related to biographers that on the morning of April 19th, he drove the Ryder truck to the Murrah Federal Building, lit the bomb's fuse, parked in front of the building, left the keys inside the truck and locked the door, then walked across the parking lot to an alley, and started to jog.

McVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001. In a direct quote McVeigh stated that he was &quot;sorry&quot; people died - but added, &quot;That's the nature of the beast.&quot;

Questions persist regarding the full extent of the conspiracy to bomb the Murrah building. Although McVeigh and Nichols were the only ones ever charged with the attack, and Nichols was by all accounts at home in Kansas at the time of the actual blast, several witnesses reported seeing McVeigh in the company of at least one other person on the morning of the bombing. A &quot;John Doe&quot; was reportedly seen exiting the Ryder truck after it was parked next to the building. As well, Nichols was known to have traveled to the Philippines on at least five occasions, and was reported by one witness to have met there with international terrorist [[wikipedia:Ramzi Yousef|Ramzi Yousef]], who was himself later arrested and convicted of masterminding the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City. More generally, those who argue for a wider conspiracy question whether McVeigh and Nichols working by themselves had the ability to produce such a large and powerful explosive device.

===Columbine High School Massacre===

On April 20, 1999, Colorado's Columbine High School was the site of a deadly rampage by two students, who killed twelve classmates, a teacher, and themselves; approximately twenty-three others were injured. The assailants were eighteen-year-old Eric Harris and seventeen-year-old Dylan Klebold, who had reportedly planned the attack for a year with hopes of killing hundreds. In addition to firearms, Klebold and Harris brought many explosive devices to the scene, including two propane bombs meant to detonate in the cafeteria during the lunch period. Though there were minor explosions, all fifteen deaths resulted from gunshots. The killers left behind videos in which they discussed their deadly plans and target practiced with old bowling pins. This massacre raised a lot of concern over youth violence and access to guns.

==The Monica Lewinsky Scandal==
The Monica Lewinsky Scandal was a scandal involving President Bill Clinton and a young White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. Bill Clinton had a relationship that was sexual in nature with the intern and lied about it in court. The catalyst of the scandal were the tape recordings of Linda Tripp and Lewinsky discussing Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton, conversations recorded by Tripp.
Monica Lewinsky was a young twenty two year old who interned at the White House only about two years later her and President Clinton were accused of having an affair. After the news got out President Clinton had a televised speech and stated &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman.&quot; This caused a huge controversy and many people began to make political jokes using Clinton's bold statement.

Initially, the Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was investigating President and Mrs. Clinton's role in the Whitewater scandal, which led to the investigation of the Lewinsky affair after Attorney-General Janet Reno granted Starr authority to probe the affair. The incident that led to the advancement of the scandal was the procurement of the tapes of Linda Tripp and Lewinsky discussing her relationship with Clinton, by Starr from Tripp. There doesn't appear to be any evidence that Starr sought the tapes out or knew of their existence, rather it was perhaps Linda Tripp who handed them over freely to Starr.

On February 12, 1999, the US Senate voted on the Articles of Impeachment requiring a two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, to convict. On Article 1, which charged that the President willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury&quot; in relation to the Paula Jones lawsuit, 45 Senators voted for guilty and removal from Office, and 55 for not-guilty and no removal from Office. On Article II, which charged that the President &quot;prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice&quot;, 50 Senators voted for guilty and 50 for not-guilty.
In his testimony, Clinton denied having had an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, an unpaid intern and later a paid staffer at the White House, in 1995–96. Lewinsky had earlier, in a deposition in the same case, also denied having such a relationship. Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater case, had previously received tape recordings made by Linda R. Tripp (a former coworker of Lewinsky's) of telephone conversations in which Lewinsky described her involvement with the president. Asserting that there was a “pattern of deception,” Starr obtained from Attorney General Janet Reno permission to investigate the matter.

The president publicly denied having had a relationship with Lewinsky and charges of covering it up. His adviser Vernon Jordan denied having counseled Lewinsky to lie in the Jones case, or having arranged a job for her outside Washington, to help cover up the affair. Hillary Clinton claimed that a “vast right-wing conspiracy” was trying to destroy her husband, while Republicans and conservatives portrayed him as immoral and a liar.


Despite the scandal many still hold firm that Clinton’s presidency was a success.  He was the first president since the depression to have consecutive quarters without a deficit.  His two terms were a success for the economy after George H.W. Bush’s tenure.  Clinton also kept us out of any major wars.  Kosovo was one of the only acts of battle that happened during the Clinton administration.

==Rodney King== 

As police cracked down on gangs and Crack Cocaine users, tensions began to mount between police and urban communities.  On April 29, 1992, the tensions reached their tipping point.  A year earlier, Los Angeles resident Rodney King was pulled over and beaten by Los Angeles police.  King, who had a history of drug and alcohol problems, initially led the police on a high speed chase going over 110 mph.  When the chase finally came to an end, King attempted to flee from officers.  Four white male officers pursued and brought down King.  But instead of simply apprehending and cuffing King the four officers proceeded to kick and use batons to beat King within an edge of his life.
	
To many urban Americans the police brutality did not seem unfamiliar, with countless others facing similar treatment.  The reason Rodney King’s story was different was because a bystander, George Holliday, captured the assault on video.  After news networks got hold of the video millions of Americans demanded for the officers to be jailed.  When the officers finally were charged and faced trial the entire nation watched on.  Then, on April 29, 1992, all four officers were acquitted of all charges.  Urban Americans and the African Americans of Los Angeles were enraged.
	
Within hours of the verdict fires were started, homes and stores were looted, and people began being attacked all across Los Angeles.  The riots were filmed by news networks and broadcast nationwide.  No matter how many police squads were released the rioting raged on.  The riots lasted for nearly a week as blacks expressed their angst over a continued oppression in America, an inequality between race, and an unwillingness by society to recognize and act on urban problems.  Over the week long riots 53 people were killed and over a billion dollars in damages was caused.

# Boil the remaining stock and add cabbage. 
# Add vinegar and cook for 15 minutes, then add potatoes and beet roots and cook for another 5 minutes. 
# Season with salt and pepper and serve hot, covered with a tablespoon of cream for each dish.

Serves 4 people.

An [[wikipedia:atom|atom]] is the smallest unit of matter that has the properties of an element. It is composed of a dense core called the [[wikipedia:Atomic_nucleus|nucleus]] and a series of [[wikipedia:Electron_shell|outer shell]]s occupied by orbiting [[wikipedia:electron|electron]]s.

The nucleus, composed of [[wikipedia:proton|proton]]s and [[wikipedia:neutron|neutron]]s, is at the center of an atom.  Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons are neutral.  The [[wikipedia:atomic_number|atomic number]] of an atom is dictated by the number of protons, which in turn, determines the chemical element of the atom.  The isotope of the element is determined by the number of neutrons.

The electron has an electric charge equal but opposite the proton (that is, they cancel). A stable atom has the same number of electrons orbiting as it does protons in the nucleus; this makes the atom electrically neutral. Atoms that are missing an electron (that is, have one more proton than electrons) will tend to attract additional electrons, while atoms that have an excess electron (one more electron than protons) will tend to eject the outer-most electron. The shell containing the outer-most electron is called the [[wikipedia:Electron_shell#Valence_shell|valence shell]], and is the chemically active shell.

In size the entire atom has been thought to be approximately four-billionths of an inch, meaning that approximately 250,000,000 atoms of this size must be put into line to span 1 inch. Atoms are not usually alone, but instead come in groups called molecules.

==Molecules ==
A molecule is a single unit created by two or more atoms that are tightly bonded together. Diatomic molecules are molecules which are made of two atoms. Certain elements are diatomic elements because they do not naturally occur as single atoms, but as a pair of atoms. The diatomic molecules are (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Hydrogen, (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Nitrogen, (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Oxygen, (F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Fluorine, (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Chlorine, (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Iodine and (Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Bromine. Earth's atmosphere is comprised, almost completely, of diatomic oxygen and nitrogen.  Molecules that are found with only one type of element in them, like the diatomic elements, are known as homoatomic molecules. When a molecule is formed from elements of a different species it is a heteroatomic molecule. As an atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains the properties of that element, a molecule is the smallest particle of a compound.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is physics? Why study physics? Physics, before everything else, is an ''experimental'' science, as are many branches of natural and physical sciences. When physicists study a phenomenon, they first observe a pattern in nature, develop a hypothesis how the pattern occurs, and test the hypothesis ''by experiment''. Thus ''experiment is the sole judge of all scientific truth''. This is in contrast to how mathematics or some branches of philosophy works, where one starts out with axioms, or self-evident truths, and proceed by means of logics.

For example, after observing the motion of falling objects, Galileo Galilei hypothesized that the time it takes for an object to fall is independent of its weight. Then he tested his hypothesis, according to legend, by dropping two equal-sized, equal-shaped objects, one made of metal and the other of wood, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Also, after observing the motion of a hanging lamp, how, as it moved back and forth, the time it took to complete one oscillation was constant, he made an hypothesis that a period, the time taken for one oscillation, of a pendulum is independent of the amplitude, how large the swing is, and he also tested this hypothesis by measuring the period with pendulums swinging with different amplitudes, everything else being equal.{{fact|article}} In fact, his invention hinging on this hypothesis is the now well-known grandfather clock.

Note that the observation or the testing of the hypothesis required an accurate measure of time and distance. We will soon come back to this topic in Part 0. 

Then, since this is how all science works, how is physics different from other sciences? One thing that separates physics is that the consistent goal of physics is to discover the fundamental laws governing our universe. Instead of simply stating, &quot;The time it takes an object to fall is independent of its weight,&quot; a physicist looks for a deeper underlying pattern that explains this observation and other similar occurences in nature as well (and in this case, that underlying pattern is Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation). For this reason, some describe physics as &quot;reverse engineering the universe.&quot; 

This is what separates physics from other sciences, and what makes it necessary for all scientists and engineers, not just the students planning on pursuing a career in physics, to learn physics.

I'm moving to Taiwan for a year and have decided to forgo a computer. Not that I won't frequent internet cafes and try remaining active, but this could seriously crimp my contributing.

== Chinese textbook ==
Nice to see your work at [[Chinese Lesson 1]]! I am working on that too. i think we need cooperation. first of all, i don't want a simplified and traditional mix-up Chinese textbook: that's too confusing for learners! they should exist separately respectively, what do you think? we can talk more about the overall plan in details later! :) --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 08:44, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Thanks for your response! I though you are a Chinese at first! so don't worry about your final, you will do it will! ;) my aim is to make this textbook best among the language books here, easy to understand, and funny to learn. we need to figure out some way as how will it be easy for a basic? a middle level learner and a high level learner? i am not majoring in Chinese, so i will just do the basic level. do you have any ideas as what is needed to be taught at that level? Here is my little plan:
# we can organize every 3-4 lessons into a &quot;Unit&quot;, talking about one topic;
# make this book systemically, which means the characters in the book should be consistent; (like Wang Ming is a student in the first lesson, and he will not be a police in the next lesson :) )

okay, the units:
#Unit 1: simple statement sentences, like &quot;what's this/that?&quot;, &quot;this/that is...&quot;, &quot;i/you/she/he am/are/is ...&quot;
#Unit 2: introduce yourself. like &quot;i am a student, i am studying in Peking University&quot;, &quot;i am 20&quot;, &quot;there are 3 persons in my family&quot;
#Unit 3: numbers and mesure words, time and date.
...

tell me what you think of that draft. --Yacht

:okay, i just joined the group, so that we can plan our textbook in details later. i know how exhausted it would be by a large vocabulary learning a foreign language, that's what i am facing when learning my English. you may take a look at [[Chinese Lesson 7]], which i follow the pattern of my Japanese textbook. there are some &quot;Additional Vocabulary&quot; (marked by *) and new words (marked by **). I guess from the 2nd text on, we can add a &quot;review&quot; at the first first beginning. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 18:51, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

Hi Everlong,

Thanks for the extensive work you've done on the Chinese Wikibooks. One quick thing though: instead of using:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ăĕĭŏŭ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Can you use instead:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;ǎěǐǒǔ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Thanks. ;) -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 03:46, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Merging ==

I guess we can merge the lesson 1 and the lesson 8 now. and move the lesson 2-lesson 6 to somewhere else. tough grammar at the very first beginning would only bore people IMO. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 04:12, 25 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Move lesson 3 to lesson 6 to [[Chinese Grammar]]? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 15:03, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Pinyin table ==

Hi Everlong, I just saw you made an initial-final combination table some time ago for the Chinese wikibook on [[Chinese/Pinyin Pronunciation]]. Coincidentally, I made the same on the english Wikipedia only a few days ago, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin_table . There are some small differences between both tables, especially regarding wether to combine the intials and finals on a logical letter base (''q + u = qu'', for example )or rather on phonetic base (''q + ü = qu''). It would be great to come up with a merge of our two tables.

Bye, Abdull ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Abdull )

==PDF==

The PDF is an excellent job. I have never looked at the book because it demands all sorts of downloads but the PDF just gives it to us straight. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:04, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
:Thanks for the compliment. It's good to know that the PDF makes the book more accessible. Not as big as some of the other Wikibooks, but the structure and detail make it among the best in Wikibooks in my opinion.

== Fighting vandalism ==

I see you reported vandalism, thanks for that. Have you seen [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#Requests for CheckUser rights]]? CheckUser rights will allow some admins to check IP of vandals using registered accounts. Can you take a look at the vote? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:29, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

== Chinese audio ==

I've created an account here and I've recorded most of the vocabulary and some of the dialogue, but I haven't uploaded anything yet. When I was recording the second dialouge, I hesitated, since I'm a tad skeptical about the choice of &quot;Amy&quot; for the name of the Chinese person. It would seem a lot more appropriate to choose a commonly used native Chinese name, and not just a Chinese version of an English name. Any thoughts on that one?

Also, I'm not quite sure how to name the dialouge files or whether I should make just one file of the entire dialogue or just one file for each line.

[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:19, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

:Peter, thanks for starting on the recording. This will make the book much more accessible to people without a teacher or those unwilling to slog through the pronunciation lessons before jumping into Lesson 1.

:About 艾美's name, you have a point. I just wanted to pick something relatively easy to write (which it is, since 美国 is also taught in the lesson) and that looked the same in simplified and traditional if possible. You can swap in another name if you like before recording.

:With the file naming, I'd say for the vocabulary, use the pinyin with tone numbers (i.e. Zh-che1.ogg). That way homonyms of the word could use the same file, which would be awkward if you named them using the characters. For the dialogues, they're pretty stable, so I think having the two parts recorded in just two files would be best. Users can always slide back a few seconds in their audio player to rehear a line. In naming them, just make it descriptive, possibly in Chinese because the Chinese of our lessons has been reused in [http://pl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chiński:_Podstawy:_Lekcja_1#Słownictwo translated] [http://it.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cinese:_Lezione_1#Vocabolario versions] of the English book (i.e. Zh-中文_第一课_你好！_1.ogg). For the example sentences in the grammar section, I'd say one file per example would be more appropriate, because those are more likely to be switched around or added to. With those I would just name them using the whole sentence in characters so that people know what it means, as homonyms would be unlikely (i.e. Zh-我不是美国人.ogg).
::-[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 22:16, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, the formula at Commons for individual words is pinyin followed by the number of the tone. If anything, it should be easy to recycle sound files after we have enough of them. Like the multitude of various &quot;shi&quot;-words.
::I know there's been trouble in the past with downloading sound files even with really simply non-English characters like &quot;åäö&quot;, so I'm worried that this will spell even more trouble for file names with Chinese characters. And I know the HTML-rendition of those characters tend to be horribly complicated. Isn't it better to just call them &quot;Zh-Lesson_1_dialogue_1.ogg&quot; or something like it? Yes, it's English, but it does seem like a reasonable compromise even for the other wikiprojects.
::[[User:Peter Isotalo|Peter]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Peter Isotalo|Isotalo]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:02, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

:::OK, I see what you mean with the name corruption. When I try to save a file with Chinese characters in the name they all are replaced by underscores. As long as we put the Chinese and any other translations on the file page, it should be fine to leave the filename in English.

== Thank you for fighting vandalism ==

I really appreciate your efforts to help combat vandalism on this project.  Neither myself nor all of the rest of the administrators can really keep track of all of Wikibooks, and any help to stop this rampant behavior is appreciated.  In this case, there is some idiot who is trying to spamlink, but is discovering that it is harder now than it was in the past.  And a perception that Wikibooks is a backwater project with nobody paying attention.

I would be cautious however.... you might just end up becoming an administrator here if you keep this behavior of yours up.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:24, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Art]] ==
Maybe the [[art]] book would be better named as [[Introduction to Art]] and [[art]] redirected to the bookshelf? If you don't think that's a good idea, ignore this w/o a response. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 21:35, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:Good idea. I hadn't even thought about bookshelves when I started the naming cleanup. With something as general as &quot;Art&quot; a bookshelf is probably best.  --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 21:39, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

== Embassy Page ==

I've been planning some major work on the [[Russian]] wikibook, and was planning on asking some people from the russian wikibooks for some help, and came across the idea of a wikibooks embassy. Apparently, I wasn't the first person with this idea, and you have listed yourself as ambassador on the meta page. I went ahead and made the module [[English Embassy]], which is basically a rough copy of wikipedia's embassy, but was planning on really opening some communication with wikibooks in other languages. I really only speak russian and spanish, though, so maybe you could help me out with this? I was thinking the first good thing to do would be to make a list of en.wikibooks users who can communicate with other wikibookians in their native tongue. Let me know what you think, [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 14:56, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

== Hi ==

to test your chinese :P

我想参加 Mandarin Wikibook。 我有一些建议。在[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Chinese/Planning 这儿]。能不能麻烦您去看一下。

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Wikibooks gazette home]] | [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks gazette|Discuss]] | [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Bulletin board]] | [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|Subscription list]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource. 

&lt;center&gt;[[User:The Staff|The Staff]]&lt;br&gt;04:16, 19 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/center&gt;

== Positive Psychology ==

I noticed you were working on a new psychology test. Interested in help yet? (I'm working on one myself, although just a tad less positive.) --[[User:Elaragirl|Elaragirl]] 19:44, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

*snorts* 我无法教我们的语言. I am ... rusty. Worse than rusty. But still, the Chinese book seems to be coming along nicely on it's own. As for positive psychology, I'm a mental health professional and I have some pretty good access to psychological libraries. I think positive psychology is overlooked, since (don't laugh) people actually prefer to feel miserable than happy so that they have something to complain about. Or maybe I'm getting cynical. :) Still, I'll see what I can come up with for you. --[[User:Elaragirl|Elaragirl]] 14:47, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

== Spam! ==

Thanks for picking that up.  I've checked the IP and it is black listed in places so I've blocked it for a while - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:37, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

Just wanted to say thanks for working on the book.  I'm shamelessly using it to get ahead before I take up Chinese this next year.  I was wondering how close Lesson 2 was to being finished too.  I was hoping eventually I could contribute, I was thinking in the vocab section, to give characters separate pages where you detail stroke order, former incarnations of the character, and maybe a brief history.  I know Japanese, so I have some of this information on hand (at least for the more obvious characters).  Anyway, keep up the great work! --[[User:Hygiene|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Hygiene&lt;/font&gt;]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Yacht. Thanks for the welcome. It would be great to collaborate on this. I've had a ton of ideas about what could be done with this, but I'd like to be able to bounce around ideas with the rest of the crew. I've been really impressed with the level of organization at the [[Japanese]] Wikibook. Although their lessons aren't too developed, they at least figured out how to talk to each other and plan together. 

I've been trying to emulate that, so I copied their idea for a [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/chinese_wiki Mailinglist]. So far no signups though. It would be good to have a centralized place for discussion rather than have it scattered among the various modules' discussion pages (so join!). We need a good debate over stuff like the splash page and Traditional vs Simplified.

Personally, I agree with you that having both in an intoductory text is confusing. I suggested to have parallel development of two texts with a crosslink for every page. For now I've started with both, but in separate columns in the dialogues and only showing the traditional in the vocab when different. I wouldn't want traditional beyond that b/c it would just get cluttered having it for the examples and everything else too.

I'm only a second-year student of Chinese, but I have some grand ideas for this Wikibook. Of course, the time I did any real work on it was only when I should have been studying for my Chinese final (in two days:&lt;). But then, Winter Break, so I should have a good month of time to put into working on it. Hope to talk later. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 09:35, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Yacht, I'm flattered that you could have thought that I was a native Chinese, though I think if you heard my pronunciation the illusion would not last very long :). 

:I've used two introductory Chinese textbooks and looked at a couple more, so I have a little perspective as to what is good, especially for a native English speaker. What really made the best ones were clear grammar explanations and lots of examples. If we follow up all the lessons with a page or two of phrases/sentences using the words of the lesson it will clear up a lot of questions. 

:I wouldn't worry about intermediate or advanced students just yet. If it's too easy for them they can always skip ahead. What we need to do now is plan out the base and build up from there. I've been looking at the order in which my textbooks tackled different sentence patterns and been trying to draw up the first few lesson plans. I made something like your Unit lesson plan, but only for lessons 1 &amp; 2 over at our [[Chinese:_Level_I_Planning#Lesson_Roadmap|planning page]]. It basically has your Units, but instead of 1-2-3, in the order 1-3-2.

:About your points:
:#I think your Unit grouping is a good idea. Every few lessons there should be a recap of what was covered with extra examples and problems. This is especially good if the text is used for a real class with midterms as it gives review for the big test.
:#I also think that consistant characters (Aimei, Ouwen, etc) are important. One book I used made no attempt at this and it was very confusing meeting new actors every lesson.
:#New point. I think that even more than character constancy is a smooth buildup from stuff learned before. In an Introductory course, any student is going to be overwhelmed with the number of characters and such. It makes no sense to barrage them with even more words they haven't learned yet. Maybe by Intermediate when they want to build up their vocabularies, but not to start. Any words or grammar structures that show up in our lessons should be taught when they first show up. That means we have to be creative during the first few lessons to not overstep, but I feel it will make things much simpler for any students using this book.

Hey, I'm not sure if this is the proper way to send a message, tell me if it's not.  Re: your message to me - I actually started by just reading through the Chinese book and touching it up as I saw fit.   But it looks like it could really use a lot of work, so I was considering at least contributing some grammar notes to Lesson 2 and maybe a second dialog.  --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 20:00, 2 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Hey Yacht, I'm not sure I understand your latest message to me, especially the last sentence.  Are you saying that you don't want to have both traditional and simplified in one book and would rather have separate ones for each?  If so, then I think that's a bad idea.  If you learn to write only simplified, you should at least be able to read traditional, and having them separated out would impede this.  Additionally, the book is definitely not only about learning characters, but also grammar and spoken Chinese.  If you separated the two writing systems into two books you would have a ton of duplicated information about grammar and such, since the characters would be the only place where the content differs.  --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 19:30, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:A couple of responses to your message.

:I am a native English speaker (which I think is the intended audience of the book) who learned/is learning Chinese at an American university.  The way that my school does things is to mix traditional and simplified characters.  We are required to choose one system to write with, and have to master the writing of that system.  However, we are required to be able to read both systems.  This has been wonderful for me - I can hand write simplified characters decently, and type them very well.  But because I can read traditional, I am even able to type traditional Chinese pretty well using Pinyin input since I can recognize the characters.  The way I achieved this proficiency in both systems was by being taught with materials that had both systems interspersed.  We had two versions of our reading materials, and I always chose the traditional version to read since I was already learning simplified characters by writing them.  More importantly, on our tests half of the questions were in tradition and half in simplified, and we had to do all of them.  This mixing made me able to read both systems, which has been a great thing for me.  And it wasn't even very hard to do, because the way things were mixed in the learning materials made it very natural to pick up both systems.

:If we make the point of telling readers that they should choose one system to write and only write with that system while attempting to read both and moreover make our materials emulate the style of education that I just described, our readers can have the same experience of easily picking up both systems as I did.  And since the reader is only writing with one system, it would be impossible for him to make a mixup like the one that you described: why would he write 書 instead of 书 if he didn't know how to write 書 in the first place?

:You say that learning both systems is not required, since a learner would be studying exclusively either for mainland China or for Taiwan.  But what about someone like me, who is looking to interact with Chinese speakers in America?  Depending on what region of America you are talking about, you will find groups of people who use traditional and groups of people who use simplified.  I have friends from both groups.

:Moreover you say that the Chinese themselves don't like having the two mixed systems and cite the Chinese Wikipedia as an example.  This is an interesting point, but I don't think it applies here.  The people who frequent the Chinese Wikipedia and those who are arguing about the issue are presumably native speakers who have been raised with one system or the other.  To them, one is familiar and the other is foreign and maybe even ugly.  To go further, there is some political charge to the issue, with Taiwan using traditional and much of the mainland using simplified.  None of these issues exist for a beginning learner who knows nothing of Chinese characters.  This beginning learner would be better off to learn to read both systems now, while both are still equally fresh and foreign to him.  I said that learning to read both systems was no extra challenge for me, and that is precisely because I was not yet used to one or the other. --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 21:55, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::Since you asked me about my major, let me just give you my background real quick (would you do the same?). I'm a Math major, not a Chinese major.  My girlfriend's family is from Taiwan, so I got into Chinese in order to be able to speak with her grandparents and was originally planning on just taking the first four lower division courses.  However, I enjoyed Chinese and some Linguistics classes I was taking so much that I switched to being a double Math and Linguistics major with a minor in Chinese. So I'm not a completely hard-core Chinese student, but I do enjoy it quite a bit. I'm not aware that my school (the University of Texas at Austin) has such a requirement of Chinese majors, but if they do it does not apply to me as a minor.

::As for the rest of your post, I truly believe that you ''are'' worrying a bit too much. You do, however, have a point in saying that the two character sets might be overwhelming to the average beginner and that they need to be warned.  But I think that if we add to the beginning of the book a thorough explanation of the situation surrounding the two character sets as well as the advice I presented before of choosing only one set to write then the reader will be fine.  We can definitely also say that if the reader is interested in only one of mainland China or Taiwan then he can ignore the irrelevant character set to simplify things.

::The situation in America is that there are tight groups of Chinese speakers in many different regions.  Each one of these groups seems to mostly be composed of either speakers from China or speakers from Taiwan, without too much mixing.  So in one place traditional characters are dominant while in another simplified characters are.  Additionally, printed materials and TV/movie subtitles are just as likely to be printed in simplified as in traditional, depending on where they come from.  Overall, I think it is useful for an American to be able to read both sets, even if they only write one.  And again I'll stress, ''if the educational materials are well-designed, I don't think it represents a significant extra amount of work for a beginner to learn to read both systems when compared to only one''.

::As for your examples, it was made very clear to me that the mapping is not 1-1 (another good example is 只), and I feel that it's not a big issue if our aforementioned introduction to the two systems also makes this clear as a pitfall.  Your example of 電腦 versus 计算机 is interesting as well, but that actually has little to do with character sets; rather it's a question of dialects.  That can be dealt with by presenting both words, and designating one as Taiwanese usage and the other as mainland usage.

::Finally, you say that maybe the problem of the two sets is only actually a problem for native speakers. I won't say that it's not a problem for foreigners but, as I pointed out in my previous message, native speakers generally have the considerable disadvantage of having been raised all of their lives with one system, never dealing with the other.  This makes the other system strange to them and, subconsciously or not, they may think it's ugly and 'wrong' (I would guess that this probably would happen more for Taiwanese raised with the traditional system). I don't believe that foreigners have this problem. --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 05:13, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

That's pretty funny; you're sort of the inverse of me.  Are you from Taiwan, China, or somewhere else?

Anyway, I don't think either of us are going to change our opinions on which way is better.  My opinion as an English speaker is still that mixing the two systems provides a benefit at very little extra cost to the reader.  But of course it is very possible that I am just an exception.  The thing to do would be to query some additional English speakers who have learned Chinese my way and see if they also found it easy.

The text I learned from comes in three volumes.  The first volume has thirty chapters.  Most chapters have two reading texts and some grammar information.  The following grammar topics (in this order) are introduced before measure words:

*Chinese word order
*the 吗 particle
*adjectival sentences (such as 我很忙) 
*是 sentences: 那是我的书
*possessive 的
*interrogative pronouns (谁，什么， etc)
*verbal predicates (你吸烟吗？)
*affirmative-negative sentences (他是不是你的弟弟？)
*verbal constructions in series (我去图书馆看书)
*word order of 也 and 都
*possession with 有
*给 and 在
*Chinese numbers

This was just a quick skim, so I probably missed some topics.  Also, I'm not sure what the copyright considerations are of copying that order, though. --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 18:01, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)


Sorry, I forgot to comment on Lesson 7.  Its English prose definitely needs some cleaning up, but the structure is pretty good.  I like the lengthy grammar explanations.

For stroke order, it would be easy enough to add a separate diagram for traditional in the cases where the characters differ.  Every Chinese book for Americans that I have ever seen uses Pinyin.  As an English speaker (and Linguistics student) I think it's a good choice, since it seems to correspond better with English orthography than the other systems (in my limited experience with them).  If we ''did'' make a separate book for traditional Chinese aimed at Taiwan or somewhere else one of the other systems might be a good idea, but in a combined book I think Pinyin is definitely the best choice.  I've read that even Taiwan is attempting to switch over to either Hanyu Pinyin or another variant.

To tell you the truth, I know next to nothing about Cantonese.  I have a coworker who's a native speaker, and he said that he's not aware of any standard romanization - it seems to be very fragmented in that respect.  Also, what does 'TC' stand for? --[[User:Aaron Jacobs|Aaron Jacobs]] 05:26, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)

'''Roasting nuts''' gives them a fuller flavour, and is a particularly good way to prepare nuts as a [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]].

Nuts can be roasted (or toasted) by placing them evenly on a sheet pan and roasting in a [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|350 degree F oven]] for five to ten minutes.

Small nuts, such as [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]] or chopped [[Cookbook:Hazelnut|hazelnuts]], can be toasted in a dry [[Cookbook:Frying pan|frying pan]] over a fairly high heat. Keep the nuts moving, with a [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]], to keep them from burning. (You can also do this with [[Cookbook:Sunflower seeds|sunflower seeds]] and [[Cookbook:Pumpkin seeds|pumpkin seeds]].)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chest pain''' caused by cardiac ischaemia is called ''angina''. It is most often triggered by exertion. Angina can also be precipitated by emotional stress, exposure to cold and sometimes may occur after eating a large meal. 
Usually it decreases when the patient rests and increases if the exertion is continued.

Insufficient blood flow to the heart results in an area of the heart muscle becoming deprived of Oxygen which then stimulates pain fibres.

The underlying pathology is narrowing of the blood vessels by fatty deposits called Atheroma. These narrowings restrict the amount of blood that can flow through the blood vessels. As the individual exercises the energy requirements and therefore oxygen needs of the heart muscle increases. If the blood flow to an area of the heart is not able to increase to cope with the heart muscles requirements Angina may result.

The main risk factors for developing Angina are: Hypertension, Hyperlipidaemia, smoking, age, Diabetes and obesity.
It is important to note that not all episodes of cardiac ischaemia are associated with pain, so called ''Silent Ischaemia'' which is found more often in people with Diabetes.

== Logical operator ==

=== Boolean operator ===

 X : Boolean := A &gt; 10 {{Ada/kw|and}} A &lt; 20;

=== Boolean shortcut operator ===

Shortcut operators are used to make the evaluation of parts of boolean expressions conditional: ''and then'', ''or else''. This should never be done to speed up the evaluation (with modern optimizing compilers, it will possibly not have that effect). The correct use is to prevent the evaluation of expressions known to raise an exception.

 {{Ada/kw|if}} Dog /= {{Ada/kw|null}} &lt;b&gt;and then&lt;/b&gt; G (Dog) {{Ada/kw|then}}
    Walk (Dog);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};

In the example above, &lt;tt&gt;G (Dog)&lt;/tt&gt; is only called when the pointer &lt;tt&gt;Dog&lt;/tt&gt; is not &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt;, i.e. it actually points to something.

Actually ''and then'' and ''or else'' are not operators in the sense of the reference manual, they are called 'Short-circuit Control Forms'. The difference is that (true) operators can be redefined (i.e. overloaded), whereas these cannot. They are however defined for any boolean type.

Since Ada allows parallel evaluation of the arguments for an expression, shortcut operators are not the standard way of evaluating boolean expressions.  In any case where the final result of the evaluation is guaranteed to be the same, the compiler is allowed to use a shortcut evaluation.

=== Boolean operator on arrays ===

The and operator is applied to each pair of boolean elements from the left and right arrays. The result has the same bounds as the left operand.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Month_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|of}} Boolean;
 
 X : Month_Array := Function_1;
 Y : Month_Array := Function_2;
 Z : Month_Array := X {{Ada/kw|and}} Y;

=== Bitwise operator ===

The operator '''and''' could be used with [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|modular types]] to perform bitwise operations.

== Adding interfaces to tagged types ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">An understanding of the basic lesions that occur on the skin is essential to the discipline of [[Introduction to Dermatology|dermatology]]. Lesions are divided into the general categories of primary and secondary. Primary lesions are those that are directly associated with the disease process and usually appear early in the course of the disease. Those appearing later are called secondary lesions and may be a result of the ongoing disease process and changes to the primary lesions. Secondary lesions are often the result of manipulation by the patient (rubbing, scratching, etc.) or the result of treatments applied to the skin after the process began.  An ulceration could be primary (the disease process) or secondary (result of scratching).

A morphological classification of dermatological lesions is most helpful to the identification of the diseases present.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dermatology is the medical science of disorders of the skin. Often skin lesions and disorders are markers of internal disease and mirror the processes occurring within the body. Dermatology has been called &quot;a window through which to see the entire body.&quot; As such an understanding of Dermatology is essential to the Internist. 

== Basics ==


=== Skin Anatomy ===
Skin consists of distinct layers.  The most superficial (most exterior) layer is the epidermis.  The epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium.  It has stacked layers of cells.  Below the epidermis lies the dermis and below that we find the subcutaneous fat, or subcutis. 

====Epidermis====
The epidermis consists of stratified squamous epithelium.  The &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; cells of the epidermis are keratinocytes.  Interspersed among the keratinocytes, we also find melanocytes and other specialized cells, known as Merkel cells.  The keratinocytes provide the structure and maintain the barrier function of the skin. Melanocytes make protective pigment.  Merkel cell function is less certain.

=== Skin Function ===

The primary functions of skin include protection from physical injury, impermeability (keeping fluids out of your body, and keeping necessary fluids inside of your body), resistance to microbial penetration, and function as a sensory end organ. 

The secondary functions of skin include:

* Immune Functions
** Dryness, desquamation, normal flora of bacteria
** Antigen presenting cells such as Langerhans cells, Keratinocytes (immunoregulating cytokine), Epidermotropic T-Cells.

* Solar and Heat Interactions
** UV Radiation Protection (melanin)
** Thermoregulation
** Vitamin D Metabolism

* Communication

=== Functional Adaptations of Skin ===
* Hair
* Nails
* Eccrine sweat glands
* Apocrine glands
* Sebaceous glands

=== Cellular Components of Skin ===
* Epidermis
** Keratinocytes
** Langerhans cells
** Melanocytes
** Merkel cells
** Lymphocytes

* Dermis
** Fibroblasts
** Connective tissue
** Extracellular proteins
** Matrix
** Endothelial cells
** Mononuclear cells
** Nerves and Neural organs

* Hypodermis
** Connective tissue
** Adipocytes
** Endothelial cells

[[Image:Bobcat.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A bobcat]]

These odd-shaped, ruff-faced cats are not as lordly as the lion or powerful as the tiger.  They are mid-sized predators, too big to bother with mice and too small to tackle a healthy adult deer.  But they do one job rather well--keeping the rabbit population under control.  With their long legs and short tails, they are superbly equipped to tackle anything from a tiny cottontail to a huge snowshoe hare. The natural enemies of the Iberian Lynx are the wolf and the bear but the most dangerous enemy  that almost extincts it is the human that kills it with traps, venom and hunts them.

==Where do lynx live?==
[[Image:lynx range.png|thumb|left|Places where lynx live are colored green.]]
The four species of lynx are very widespread.  The European Lynx lives in northern [[Wikijunior:Europe|Europe]] and Asia.   The Canadian Lynx lives in North America.  The Iberian (or Spanish) Lynx is one of the most highly endangered cats and only lives in wild parts of [[Wikijunior:Europe/Spain|Spain]].  Bobcats are the smallest type of lynx, living in North America.  Because they hunt small prey, they live in a wide variety of habitats. The Iberian Lynx is an animal which lives only in the Iberian Peninsula. 

==What do lynx look like?==

[[Image:Lynx lynx poing.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A lynx]]

Not all lynx look the same. Some of them have dark spots, while others have plain yellow or gray fur. All of them have white bellies. Lynx have long hairs at the tops of their ears, and a beard around their jaw. A bobcat is much smaller than a regular lynx. The lynx males weigh 40 pounds (18 kg) or more, and females weigh 18 to 30 pounds (8 to 14 kg), but the bobcat males only weigh 16 to 28 pounds (7 to 13 kg) and the females weigh 10 to 18 pounds (5 to 8 kg). The lynx also stands at 30 to 42 inches (74 to 107 cm) high, but the bobcat only is only 17 to 23 inches (43 to 58 cm) high. The bobcat also lacks the distinctive ear tufts and looks more like a big house cat. They have smaller feet and shorter legs compared to other lynx, and almost always have spots. The most unique part on the lynx and bobcat is their tail.  The bobcat was named after its tail, because it is &quot;bobbed&quot; or short.

==What do lynx and bobcats eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
[[Image:Lynx-canadensis.jpg|thumb|right|A lynx hunting]]
Lynx eat mainly arctic hares (a large member of the rabbit family). They sometimes eat squirrels, ptarmigan (birds that look like large pigeons), and grouse (which look like fancy chickens). The Iberian Lynx feeds mostly on rabbits and hares.

Bobcats eat smaller animals like squirrels, rabbits, and mice.  Their odd shape with long legs, a short neck and short tail, is an adaptation to hunting prey that must be captured with a sudden burst of speed and a killing pounce.  In order to catch their prey, they must first sneak up as carefully and close as they can (stalking), and only make a final rushing attack when the prey makes a run for it.  Obviously the closer they can approach before the run, the greater their chances of success.

They can't eat more than three pounds of meat at a time.

One common prey species for lynx, the arctic hare, has a secret weapon.  Every year when the snow melts on the Arctic tundra (swampy grasslands) the timid animal sheds its white winter coat for a new crop of brown fur.  This does not happen all at once, so while the hare still has patches of white, it still matches the surroundings where bits of snow still linger on the ground.  By staying perfectly still, these hares are nearly impossible to see.  This strategy often accomplishes a great deal more than running away.

==Fun facts==
To show their toughness, people used to claim that, in a fight, they could triumph over their &quot;weight in bobcats&quot;. However, bobcat experts would not believe this claim for a moment. All cats are stronger for their size than any human.

The '''Atmel AVR'''&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is a family of 8-bit RISC [[w:microcontroller|microcontrollers]] produced by [[w:Atmel|Atmel]].  The AVR architecture was conceived by two students at the '''Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH)''' and further refined and developed at '''Atmel Norway''', the Atmel daughter company founded by the two chip architects.

== Memory ==

The memory of the Atmel AVR processors is a [[w:Modified Harvard architecture|Modified Harvard architecture]], in which the program and data memory are on separate buses to allow faster access and increased capacity.  The AVR uses internal memory for data and program storage, and so does not require any external memory.

The four types of memories in a Atmel AVR are:
* Data memory: registers, I/O registers, and SRAM
* Program flash memory
* EEPROM
* Fuse bits

All these memories are on the same chip as the CPU core.
Each kind of memory is separated from each other, in different locations on the chip. Address 0 in data memory is distinct from address 0 in program flash and address 0 in EEPROM.

===Program Memory===

All AVR microcontrollers have some amount of 16 bit wide non-volatile [[w:Flash memory|flash]] memory for program storage, from 1&amp;nbsp;KB up to 256&amp;nbsp;KB (or, 512-128K typical program words). The program memory holds the executable program opcodes and static data tables. Program memory is linearly addressed, and so mechanisms like page banking or segment registers are not required to call any function, regardless of its location in program memory.

AVRs cannot use external program memory; the flash memory on the chip is the only program memory available to the AVR core.

The flash program memory can be reprogrammed using a programming tool, the most popular being those that program the chip ''in situ'' and are called in-system programmers (ISP).  Atmel AVRs can also be reprogrammed with a high-voltage parallel or serial programmer, and via JTAG (again, ''in situ'') on certain chips.  The flash memory in an AVR can be re-programmed at least 10,000 times.

Many of the newer AVRs (MegaAVR series) have the capability to self-program the flash memory.  This functionality is used mainly by [[Embedded Systems/Bootloaders and Bootsectors|bootloaders]].

===Data Memory===

Data Memory includes the registers, the I/O registers, and internal SRAM.

The AVR has thirty-two general purpose eight-bit registers (R0 to R31), six of which can be used in pairs as sixteen-bit pointers (X, Y, and Z).

All AVR microcontrollers have some amount of RAM, from 32 bytes up to several KB. This memory is byte addressable. The register file (both general and special purpose) is mapped into the first addresses and thus accessible also as RAM. Some of the tiniest AVR microcontrollers have only the register file as their RAM.

The data address space consists of the register file, I/O registers, and SRAM. The working registers are mapped in as the first thirty-two memory spaces (0000&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;-001F&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;) followed by the reserved space for up to 64 I/O registers (0020&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;-005F&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;). The actual usable SRAM starts after both these sections (address 0060&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;). (Note that the I/O register space may be larger on some more extensive devices, in which case the beginning address of SRAM will be higher.) Even though there are separate addressing schemes and optimized opcodes for register file and I/O register access, they can still be addressed and manipulated as if they were SRAM.

The I/O registers (and the program counter) are reset to their default starting values when a reset occurs.
The registers and the rest of SRAM have initial random values, so typically one of the first things a program does is clear them to all zeros or load them with some other initial value.

The registers, I/O registers, and SRAM never wear out, no matter how many times they are written.

====External Data Memory====

Some of the higher pin-count AVR microcontrollers allow for external expansion of the data space, addressable up to 64&amp;nbsp;KB.  When enabled, external SRAM is overlaid by internal SRAM; an access to address 0000&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; in the data space will always resolve to on-chip memory.  Depending on the amount of on-chip SRAM present in the particular AVR, anywhere from 512 bytes to several KB of external RAM will not be accessible.  This usually does not cause a problem.

The support circuitry required is described in the datasheet for any device that supports external data memory, such as the [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2513.pdf Mega 162], in the &quot;External Memory Interface&quot; section.  The support circuitry is minimal, consisting of a '573 or similar latch, and potentially some chip select logic.  The SRAM chip select may be tied to a logic level that permanently enables the chip, or it may be driven by a pin from the AVR.  For an SRAM of 32&amp;nbsp;KB or less, one option is to use a higher-order address line to drive the chip select line to the SRAM.

===EEPROM Storage===

Almost all AVR microcontrollers have internal [[w:EEPROM|EEPROM]] memory for non-volatile data storage.
Only the Tiny11 and Tiny28 have no EEPROM.

EEPROM memory is not directly mapped in either the program or data space, but is instead accessed indirectly as a peripheral, using I/O registers.  Many compilers available for the AVR hide some or all of the details of accessing EEPROM.  [[w:IAR Systemes|IAR]]'s C compiler for the AVR recognizes the compiler-specific keyword &lt;code&gt;__eeprom&lt;/code&gt; on a variable declaration.  Thereafter, a person writes code to read and write that variable with the same standard C syntax as normal variables (in RAM), but the compiler generates code to access the EEPROM instead of regular data memory.

Atmel's datasheets indicate that the EEPROM can be re-written a minimum of 100,000 times.  An application must implement a wear-leveling scheme if it writes to the EEPROM so frequently that it will reach the write limit before it reaches the expected lifetime of the device.  AVRs ship from the factory with the EEPROM erased, i.e. the value in each byte of EEPROM is FF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;.

Many of the AVRs have errata about writing to EEPROM address 0 under certain power conditions (usually during [[w:Brownout (electricity)|brownout]]), and so Atmel recommends that programs not use that address in the EEPROM.

===Fuse Settings===
A fuse is an EEPROM bit that controls low level features and pin assignments. Fuses are not accessible by the program; they can only be changed by a chip programmer. Fuses control features which must be set before the chip can come out of reset and begin executing code.

The most frequently modified fuses include:

#Oscillator/crystal characteristics, including drive strength and start-up time.
#JTAG pins used for JTAG or GPIO
#&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt; pin used as a reset input, debugWire, or GPIO
#Brown Out Detect (BOD) enable and BOD voltage trigger points

There is also a fuse to enable serial in-system programming, which is set by default. If it is set incorrectly, the only way to program the chip is by using a high-voltage programmer, such as the STK-500, AVR Dragon, or third-party programmer. A developer is therefore cautioned to be careful when manipulating fuses.

== Reset ==
The AVR's &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt; pin is an active-low input that forces a reset of the processor and its integrated peripherals.  The line can be driven by an external power-on reset generator, a voltage supervisor (which asserts &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt; when the power supply voltage drops below a predefined threshold), or another component in a larger system.  For example, if the AVR is managing a few sensors and servos as part of a large integrated system, another controller might observe some condition that justifies resetting the AVR; it could do so by asserting the AVR's &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt; line.

AVRs also include a [[Embedded_Systems/Threading_and_Synchronization#Watchdog_Timer | watchdog timer]], which can reset the processor when it times out.  The watchdog timer must be reset periodically to prevent it from timing out.  Failure to reset the watchdog timer is usually an indication that the program code has failed (locked up, entered an infinite loop, or otherwise gone astray), and the processor should be reset. On some AVRs the watchdog can be programmed to issue an interrupt instead of resetting the processor. This functionality can be used to wake up the AVR from a sleep mode.

The &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline&quot;&gt;RESET&lt;/span&gt; pin is used for in-system serial programming, as a GPIO, or for debugWIRE&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; low pin count debugging, depending on the chip and the programming of the fuse bits.  If the reset functionality of that pin is disabled, it cannot be recovered by in-system serial programming, and another method such as high-voltage programming must be used.

== Interrupts ==

AVRs support multiple interrupt sources, both internal and external.  An interrupt could be from an internal peripheral reaching a certain state (i.e. character received on UART), or from an external event like a certain level on a pin.  Each interrupt source causes a jump to a specific location in memory.  That location is expected to contain either a RETI (Return from Interrupt) instruction to essentially ignore the interrupt, or a jump to the actual interrupt handler.

Most AVRs have at least one dedicated external interrupt pin (INT0).  Older AVRs can trigger an interrupt on a high or low level, or on a falling edge.  Newer AVRs add more options, such as triggering on the rising edge or either edge.  Additionally, many of the newer AVRs implement pin-change interrupts for all pins in groups of eight, eliminating the need for [[w:Polling_%28computer_science%29|polling]] the pins.  The pin-change interrupt handler must examine the state of the pins that are associated with that interrupt vector, and determine what action to take.

Due to button bounce issues, it is considered poor design to connect a push button or other user input directly to an interrupt pin; some debouncing or other signal conditioning must be interposed so that the signal from the button does not violate the setup and hold times required on the interrupt pins.

== General Purpose I/O Ports ==

General Purpose I/O, or GPIO, pins are the digital I/O for the AVR family.  These pins are true push-pull outputs.  The AVR can drive a high or low level, or configure the pin as an input with or without a pull-up.  GPIOs are grouped into &quot;ports&quot; of up to 8 pins, though some AVRs do not have enough pins to provide all 8 pins in a particular port, e.g. the Mega48/88/168 does not have a PortC7 pin.  Control registers are provided for setting the data direction, output value (or pull-up enabled), and for reading the value on the pin itself.  An individual pin can be accessed using bitwise manipulation instructions.

Each port has 3 control registers associated with it, DDRx, PORTx, and PINx.  Each bit in those registers controls one GPIO pin, i.e. bit 0 in DDRA controls the data direction for PortA0 (often abbreviated PA0), and bit 0 in PORTA will control the data (or pullup) for PA0.

The DDR (Data Direction Register) controls whether the pin is an input or an output.  When the pin is configured as an output, the corresponding bit in the PORT register will control the drive level to the pin, high or low.  When the pin is configured as an input, the bit in the PORT register controls whether a pull-up is enabled or disabled on that pin.  The PIN (Port Input) register was read-only on earlier AVRs, and was used to read the value on the port pin, regardless of the data direction.  Newer AVRs allow a write to the PIN register to toggle the corresponding PORT bit, which saves a few processor cycles when bit-banging an interface.

== Timer/Counters ==

All AVRs have at least one 8-bit timer/counter.  For brevity, a timer/counter is usually referred to as simply a timer.

Some of the Tiny series have only one 8-bit timer.  At the high end of the Mega series, there are chips with as many as six timers (two 8-bit and four 16-bit).

A timer can be clocked directly by the system clock, by a divided-down system clock, or by an external input (rising or falling edge).  Some AVRs also include an option to use an external crystal, asynchronous to the system clock, which can be used for maintaining a real-time clock with a 32.768&amp;nbsp;kHz crystal.

In normal mode, the timer counts up to the top FF&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (or FFFF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;), roll over to zero, and set an overflow bit, which may cause an interrupt if enabled.  Within the interrupt routine, the counter can be loaded with the desired value in addition to any other processing required.

The Clear Timer on Compare (CTC) mode allows for the timer to be cleared when it matches a value in the compare register, before the timer reaches the top and overflows.  Clearing the timer prior to overflow manipulates the timer resolution, allowing for greater control of the output frequency of a compare match.  It can also simplify the counting of an external event.

The value of a timer can be read back at any time, even while it is running.  (There is a specific sequence documented in the datasheets to read back a 16-bit timer so that a consistent result is returned, since the AVR can only move 8 bits at a time.) A timer can be halted temporarily by changing its clock input to &quot;no clock source,&quot; then resumed by re-selecting the previous clock input.

=== PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) ===

Many of the AVRs include a compare register for at least one of the timers.  The compare register can be used to trigger an interrupt and/or toggle an output pin (i.e. OC1A for Timer 1) when the timer value matches the value in the compare register.  This may be done separately from the overflow interrupt, enabling the use of pulse-width modulation (PWM).

Some AVRs also include options for phase-correct PWM, or phase- and frequency-correct PWM. Phase correction is required by many motors.

The ATtiny26 is unique in its inclusion of a 64&amp;nbsp;MHz high-speed PWM mode.  The 64&amp;nbsp;MHz clock is generated from a PLL, and is independent of, and asynchronous to, the processor clock.  

Some AVRs also include complementary outputs suitable for controlling some motors.  A dead-time generator (DTG) inserts a delay between one signal falling and the other signal rising so that both signals are never high at the same time. The high-end AT90PWM series allows the dead time to be programmed as a number of system clock cycles, while other AVRs with this feature simply use 1 clock cycle for the dead time.

=== Output Compare Modulator ===

An Output Compare Modulator (OCM), which allows generating a signal that is modulated with a carrier frequency.  OCM requires two timers, one for the carrier frequency, and the second for the signal to be modulated.  OCM is available on some of the Mega series.

== Serial Communication ==

AVR microcontrollers are in general capable of supporting a plethora of serial communication protocols and serial bus standards. The exact types of serial communication support varies between the different members of the AVR microcontroller family.

On top of support in hardware there is also often the option to implement a particular serial communication mechanism entirely in software. Typically this is used in case a particular AVR controller does not support some serial communication mechanism in hardware, the particular hardware is already in use (e.g. when two RS-232 interfaces are needed, but only one is supported in hardware), or the chip's  hardware can't be used, because it shares pins with other chip functions, and such a function is already in used for the particular hardware. The latter often happens with the low-pincount AVRs in DIP packages.

Finally, there is also the possibility to use additional logic to implement a serial communication function. For example, most AVRs don't support the USB bus (some later ones do so, however). When using an AVR which doesn't support USB directly, a circuit designer can add USB functionality with a fixed-function chip such as the FTDI232 USB to RS-232 converter chip, or a general-purpose USB interface such as the PDIUSB11. Adding additional electronics is in fact necessary for some supported communication protocols, e.g. standard-compliant RS-232 communication requires adding voltage level converters like the MAX232.

The number of serial communication possibilities supported by a particular AVR can be confusing at times, in particular if the pins are shared with other chip functions. An intensive study of the particular AVR's datasheet is highly recommended. The serial communication features most commonly to be found on AVRs are discussed in the following sections.

=== Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART) ===

Recent AVRs typically come with a Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART) built-in. A USART is a programmable piece of hardware which is capable of generating and decoding various serial communication protocols. USART is an acronym from the following words:

;Universal:Can be used in a lot of different serial communication scenarios
;Synchronous:Can be used for synchronous serial communication (sender and receiver are synchronised by a particular clock signal)
;Asynchronous:Can be used for asynchronous serial communication (sender and receiver are not explicitly synchronised via a clock signal, but synchronise on the data signal).
;Receiver:The hardware in the AVR can receive serial data
;Transmitter:The hardware can send serial data

Earlier AVRs had a UART that did not support synchronous serial communication, hence the absence of the &quot;S&quot; in the acronym.

USARTs or UARTs work with logic voltage levels while e.g. the RS-232 protocol requires much different voltage levels than the 5&amp;nbsp;V or 3.3&amp;nbsp;V supplies found on AVR circuits. The conversion from and to such voltage levels is performed by an additional chip  which is commonly called a line driver or line interface. 

With the right line interface an AVR's USART can, for example, be used to communicate with RS-232, RS-485, MIDI, LIN bus, or CANbus devices, to name some of the popular protocols.

See [[Robotics: Computer Control: The Interface: Networks]] for more details.

====RS-232 Signalling====

The RS-232 specification calls for a negative voltage to represent a &quot;1&quot; bit, and a positive voltage to represent a &quot;0&quot; bit.  The spec allows for levels from +3 to +15&amp;nbsp;V, and -3 to -15&amp;nbsp;V, but +/-12&amp;nbsp;V is commonly seen.  The AVR does not have the ability to drive a negative output voltage on any GPIO pin, and so a level converter, such as the [[Serial_Programming:MAX232_Driver_Receiver|MAX232]], is used to talk to PCs and strict RS-232 devices.  See [[Serial Programming:RS-232 Connections]] for more detail on RS-232 wiring.

RS-232 has a relatively short maximum cable length.  For longer cabling distances, consider using [[Serial Programming:RS-485 Technical Manual|RS-485]] signaling on your USART.

=== Two Wire Interface ===
TWI is a variant of Phillips' [[w:I2C | I&amp;sup2;C]] bus interface.  I&amp;sup2;C consists of two wires, known as SDA (serial data) and SCL (serial clock), which use open-drain drivers and therefore require pull-ups to a logic-1 state.  I&amp;sup2;C uses a common ground, so all devices on the bus should be at the same ground potential to avoid ground loops.  TWI uses 7 bit addressing, which allows for multiple devices to connect to the bus.

Many TWI devices have at least the top four bits of the address hard-coded, and the remaining bits configurable by some means such as connecting dedicated address pins to power or ground; this often allows for only 2-8 model ''X'' devices on the bus. The AVR's TWI hardware can act as Master or Slave, and can meet the 400&amp;nbsp;kbit/s spec.

=== Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) ===
SPI, the [[w:Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]], is a master-slave synchronous serial protocol. This means that there is a clock line which determines where the pulses are to be sampled, and that one of the parties is always in charge of initiating communication. It uses at least three lines, which are called:

; MISO: Master In Slave Out.
; MOSI: Master Out Slave In.
; SCK: Serial Clock.

Conceptually, SPI is a bidirectional shift register; as bits are shifted out on either MISO or MOSI, bits are shifted in on the other line.  The master always controls the clock.

An SPI slave has a Slave Select (SS) signal, which signals to the slave that it should respond to messages from the master.  SS is almost always active-low.  If there is only one master and one slave, the slave's SS line could be tied low, and the master would not need to drive it.  If there are two or more slaves, then the master must use a separate slave select signal to each slave.  The downside of this approach is that the master can only address as many slaves as it has extra outputs (without the use of a separate decoder).

'''Hardware Implementation'''
The larger AVR microcontrollers have built-in SPI transceivers (from the ATmega8 upwards).  The serial clock is derived from the processor clock, with several divisors available.  The data length is always 8 bits.  The clock polarity and phase may be configured, leading to four possible combinations of when the data is clocked in and out of the chip.  This interface is very popular, and is widely available on a variety of other processors and peripherals.

The pins used for the SPI bus are also used as a way of programming the chip via ISP (In System Programming)(Except on the mega128).

'''Universal Serial Interface'''
Some AVRs, particularly in the Tiny family, provide a Universal Serial Interface (USI) instead of an SPI.  The USI is capable of operating as an SPI, but also as an I2C controller, and with a little extra effort, a USART.  The bit length of the transfer is configurable, as is the clock driver.  The clock can be driven by software, by the timer 0 overflow, or by an external source.

'''Software Implementation'''
SPI can be implemented using [[w:bit-banging|bit-banging]] of the I/O lines. An efficient implementation of a slave can be done by connecting SCLK to an external interrupt source.

The datasheet for a particular AVR provides a block diagram of the SPI or USI controller on that chip.

=== Protocol Issues ===

SPI, RS-232, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C, and other serial interfaces only define the method by which bits and bytes are transmitted; they correspond to layer 1 in the [[w:OSI model|OSI model]], the physical layer.  The bytes could be anything: temperature readings (in Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on your sensor), readings from a pressure sensor, control signals to turn off a pump, or the bytes of a JPEG image.  Some of this meaning may be assigned by the use of a serial communications protocol.

A serial protocol must handle a wide variety of usage conditions, as well as provide for recovering from failures.  For example, if two sensors are connected to a single microcontroller (such as inside and outside temperature), the protocol provides a way for the receiver on the other end of the serial line to discern which reading belongs to which sensor.  If a cable is unplugged during transmission, or a byte is lost due to line noise, the protocol can provide a way to re-synchronize the transmitter and the receiver.

The [[Serial Programming]] wikibook contains more discussion of serial protocols.

== Analog Interfaces ==

=== Analog to Digital ===

Analog to digital conversion uses digital number to represent the proportion of the analog signal sampled.  For example, by applying a 3&amp;nbsp;V to the input of an ADC with a full-scale range of 5&amp;nbsp;V, will result as a digital output of 60% of the full range of the digital output.
The digital number can be represented in 8 or 10 bits by the ADC.  An 8 bit converter will provide output from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2^8 - 1&lt;/math&gt;, or 255. 10 bits will provide output from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2^{10} - 1=1023&lt;/math&gt;.  

10 bit sample: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3 V}{5 V} = 0.6 \times 1023 = 614&lt;/math&gt; in ADCH:ADCL or 

8 bit sample: &lt;math&gt;\frac{3 V}{5 V} = 0.6 \times 255 = 153&lt;/math&gt; in ADCL

Many AVRs include an ADC, specifically a [[w:Successive Approximation ADC|successive-approximation ADC]].  The ADC reference voltage (5&amp;nbsp;V in the example above) can be an external voltage, an internal fixed 1.1&amp;nbsp;V reference.

AVRs with an ADC have several analog inputs which are connected to the ADC via an analog multiplexer.  Only one analog input can be converted at any given time.  The ADC controller provides a method for sequentially converting the inputs, so that an AVR can easily cycle through multiple sources thousands of times a second.  AVRs can run ADC conversions continuously in the background, or use a special &quot;ADC sleep&quot; mode to halt the processor while a conversion is taking place, to minimize voltage disturbances from the rest of the MCU.

=== Analog Comparator Peripheral ===
Nearly all AVR microcontrollers feature an Analog Comparator which can be used to implement an ADC on those AVRs which do not have an ADC, or if all of the ADC inputs are already in use.  Atmel provides sample code and documentation for using the comparator as a low-speed ADC.  The signal to be measured is connected to the inverted input, and a reference signal is connected to the non-inverting input. The AVR generates an interrupt when the signal falls below or rises above the reference value.

A common use for the analog comparator is sensing battery voltage, to alert the user to a low battery.

== Other Integrated Hardware ==
Aside from what might be considered typical peripherals for a microcontroller (UART, SPI, ADC), some AVRs include more specialized peripherals for specific applications.

=== LCD Driver ===

In larger models like the ATmega169 (as seen in the AVR Butterfly), an LCD driver is integrated. The LCD driver commandeers several ports of the AVR to drive the column/row connections of a display. One particular trait of liquid crystals that must be taken care of is that no DC bias is put through it. DC bias, or having more electrons passing one way than the other when pumping AC, chemically breaks apart the liquid crystal. The AVR's LCD module uses precise timing to drive pixels forwards and backwards equally.

=== USB Interface ===
{{main | Serial Programming/USB }}

The [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/devices.asp?family_id=607#1761 AT90USB] series includes an on-chip USB controller.  Some models are &quot;function&quot; only, while others have On-The-Go functionality to act as either a USB host (for interfacing with other slave devices) or as a USB slave (for interfacing with a USB master).

AVRs without built-in USB can use an external chip such as the PDIUSB12, or for a low-speed and minimal functionality device, a firmware-only approach.

Two firmware-only USB drivers are
* [http://www.obdev.at/products/avrusb/index.html obdev], which is available under an Open Source compliant license with some restrictions, and
* [http://www.xs4all.nl/~dicks/avr/usbtiny/index.html USBtiny], which is licensed under the GPL.
* The LUFA library, released under the MIT License, allows the USB-enabled AVR microcontrollers to act as a USB Host, slave or OTG device.[http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php]

Although these software implementation provide a very cheap way to add USB connectivity, they are limited to low-speed transfers, and tie up quite some AVR resources. Other hardware ICs which translate USB signals to RS-232 (serial) for the AVRs are available, from vendors such as [http://www.ftdichip.com/ FTDI]. These ICs have the advantage of offloading the strenuous task of managing the USB connection with the disadvantage of being limited to the speed of the AVR's serial port.
See [[Embedded Systems/Particular Microprocessors#USB interface]] for more details on such USB interface chips.

=== Temperature Sensor ===
Some newer models have a built in temperature sensor hooked up to the ADC.

== AVR Selection ==

The AVR microcontrollers are divided into three groups:

*tinyAVR
*AVR (Classic AVR)
*megaAVR

The difference between these devices mostly lies in the available features. The tinyAVR microcontrollers are usually devices with lower pin-count or reduced feature set compared to the megaAVRs. All AVR devices have the same basic instruction set and memory organization, so migrating from one device to another AVR is usually trivial.

The classic AVR is mostly EOL'd, and so new designs should use the Mega or Tiny series. Some of the classic AVRs have replacement parts in the mega series, e.g. the AT90S8515 is replaced by the mega8515.

Atmel provides a [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/param_table.asp?family_id=607&amp;OrderBy=part_no&amp;Direction=ASC Parametric Product Table] which compares the memory, peripherals, and features available on the entire line of AVRs.

=== Hardware Design Considerations ===
Atmel provides the [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2521.pdf AVR Hardware Design Considerations] to assist the hardware designer. This document also shows the standard in-circuit serial programming connector.

=== AVR development/application boards ===
==== Butterfly Demo Board ====
The AVR Butterfly is a self-contained, battery-powered demonstration board running the ATMEL AVR ATmega169V Microcontroller. The board includes an LCD screen, joystick, speaker, serial port, RTC, flash chip, temperature, light and voltage sensors. The board has a shirt pin on its back and can be worn as a name badge.

The AVR Butterfly comes preloaded with software to demonstrate the capabilities of the microcontroller. Factory firmware can scroll your name, display the sensor readings, and show the time. Also, the AVR Butterfly has a piezo buzzer that can reproduce sound.

The AVR Butterfly demonstrates LCD driving by running a 14-segment, 6 alpha-numeric character display. However, the LCD interface consumes many of the I/O pins.

The Butterfly's ATmega169 CPU is capable of speeds up to 8&amp;nbsp;MHz, however it is factory set by software to 2&amp;nbsp;MHz to preserve the button battery life. A pre-installed bootloader program allows the board to be re-programmed with a standard RS-232 serial plug.

Ecros Technology produces a [http://ecrostech.com/AtmelAvr/Butterfly/index.htm carrier board for the Butterfly] which provides a power supply, convenient connections to I/O ports, a DB-9 serial port (with level translator), and a large prototyping area.

==== STK500 starter kit ====
The STK500 starter kit and development system features ISP and high voltage programming for all AVR devices, either directly or through extension boards. The board is fitted with DIP sockets for all AVRs available in DIP packages.

Several expansion modules are available for the STK500 board. These include:
*STK501 - Adds support for microcontrollers in 64 pin TQFP packages.
*STK502 - Adds support for LCD AVRs in 64 pin TQFP packages.
*STK503 - Adds support for microcontrollers in 100 pin TQFP packages.
*STK504 - Adds support for LCD AVRs in 100 pin TQFP packages.
*STK505 - Adds support for 14 and 20 pin AVRs.
*STK520 - Adds support for 14 and 20 pin microcontrollers from the AT90PWM family.

==== Third-Party Boards ====

There are many AVR based development and/or application boards available from third parties, far too many to list all of them here.

== Programming Interfaces ==
There are many means to get program code onto the AVR.

=== In System Programming ===
Functionally, ISP is done through [[w:Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]], with some twiddling on Reset. As long as the SPI pins of the AVR aren't connected to anything disruptive, the AVR chip could stay soldered onto a board while reprogramming. All that's needed is a 6 pin plug, and an affordable PC adapter. This is the most common way to develop with an AVR.

Atmel's AVR ISP mkII connects to a PC's USB port and performs in-system programming using Atmel's software.

[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude avrdude] (AVR Downloder UploaDEr) runs on Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and Mac OS X, and supports a variety of in-system programming hardware, including Atmel AVR ISP mkII, Atmel JTAG ICE, older Atmel serial-port based programmers, and various third-party and &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; programmers.

=== High Voltage Serial Programming ===
HVSP is mostly the backup mode on smaller AVRs. An 8 pin package doesn't leave many unique signal combinations to kick the AVR into programming mode. HVSP is essential when working with an AVR whose RESET pin is disabled to allow using it as another general-purpose IO pin. As RESET no longer has its in-built function for SPI programming, the 12 volt signal allows reliable signalling that programming should take place, as it is something the chip should not otherwise see during normal operation.

=== High Voltage Parallel Programming ===
HVP is a backup mode on larger AVRs. It may be the only way to talk to an AVR that has a crazy oscillator fuse set. Parallel programming may also be faster, good if you have a modest production line going.

=== Bootloader Programming ===
Most AVR models can reserve a bootloader region, 256&amp;nbsp;B - 2&amp;nbsp;KB, where re-programming code can reside. At power on, the bootloader runs first, and does some user-programmed determination whether to re-program, or jump to the main application.  The code can re-program through any interface available, it could read an encrypted binary through an Ethernet adapter if it felt like it. Atmel has application notes and code pertaining to any interface from RS-232 onwards.

Bootloaders are covered in detail in chapter
[[../Bootloaders and Bootsectors/]]
.

=== No Programming at All ===
The AT90SC series of AVRs are available with a mask ROM rather than flash for program memory. [http://www.atmel.com/products/secureavr/overview.asp]

Because of the large up-front cost and minimum order quantity, mask ROM is only cost-effective for a large production run.

== Debugging Interfaces ==
The AVR offers several options for debugging, mostly involving on-chip debugging while the chip is in the target system.

=== '''JTAG''' ===
JTAG provides access to on-chip debugging functionality while the chip is running in the target system.  JTAG allows accessing internal memory and registers, setting breakpoints on code, and single-stepping execution to observe system behaviour.

Atmel provides a series of JTAG adapters for the AVR.

# The [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2737 JTAGICE adapter] interfaces to the PC via a standard serial port.  It is somewhat expensive by hobbyist standards at around US$300, although much more affordable than many other microntroller emulation systems.  The JTAGICE has been [[w:End-of-life_(product)|EOL'ed]], though it is still supported in AVR Studio and other tools.
# The [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3353 JTAGICE mkII] replaces the JTAGICE, and is similarly priced.  The JTAGICE mkII interfaces to the PC via USB, and supports both JTAG and the newer debugWIRE interface.
# The [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3891 AVR Dragon] is a low-cost (approximately $50) substitute for the JTAGICE mkII for certain target parts.  The AVR Dragon provides in-system serial programming, high-voltage serial programming and parallel programming, as well as JTAG or debugWIRE emulation for parts with 32&amp;nbsp;KB of program memory or less.

There are also several third party JTAG debuggers/reprogrammers for around $40, such as those from Ecros and Olimex, as well as [[w:Do it yourself|DIY]] projects, including [http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/evertool/ Evertool] and [http://aquaticus.info/jtag Aquaticus].  These are clones of the original JTAGICE,

JTAG can also be used to perform a [[w:Boundary scan|Boundary Scan]] test [http://atmel.com/dyn/corporate/view_detail.asp?ref=&amp;FileName=JTEGICE.html&amp;SEC_NAME=product], which tests the electrical connections between AVRs and other Boundary Scan capable chips in a system.  Boundary scan is well-suited for a production line; the hobbyist is probably better off testing with a multimeter or oscilloscope.

=== debugWIRE ===
debugWIRE&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; is Atmel's solution for providing on-chip debug capabilities via a single microcontroller pin.  It is particularly useful for lower pin count parts which cannot provide the four &quot;spare&quot; pins needed for JTAG.  The JTAGICE mkII and the AVR Dragon support debugWIRE.  debugWIRE was developed after the original JTAGICE release, and none of the JTAG clones support it.

=== Simulation ===
Simulation is not a debugging interface, ''per se'', but simulation in software can be an effective debugging aid prior to committing a design to physical hardware.

[http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSTUDIO.aspx Atmel Studio] simulates the AVR core at the assembly language level, and allows viewing and manipulation of all internal registers.  [http://www.helmix.at/hapsim/ HAPsim] is a set of virtual devices that plug into AVR Studio. It provides LCDs, LEDs, buttons, and dumb terminals.

Other software packages exist which provide software simulation of the AVR core and peripherals are available.

* [http://www.amctools.com/vmlab.htm VMLab] provides full-circuit simulation as well as a virtual oscilloscope.  The debugger offers the ability to single step C code, as well as edit and rebuild winAVR programs.  As of version 3.12, VMLab is freeware.

* [http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/avrora/index.html AVRora] is an &quot;AVR simulation and analysis framework.&quot;

* [http://www.labcenter.co.uk/ Proteus] provides schematic capture, PCB editing, and microcontroller simulation, including the AVR.  The simulator &quot;downloads&quot; code into simulated AVR core.  There is also support for a variety of virtual peripherals within the simulator.

* [http://www.nongnu.org/simulavr/ Simulavr] is a free (GPLv2) simulator working with GDB and commonly used with AVR-GCC.

== Firmware Programming ==

A microcontroller won't do much without [[w:Firmware|firmware]]; program code to tell the microcontroller what to do.  Firmware for AVRs can be written in many different languages.  Atmel published  [http://www.atmel-grenoble.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/novice.pdf The Novice's Guide to AVR Development], part of [http://www.atmel.com/journal/documents/issue1/journal.pdf Atmel Applications Journal 2001 Summer], which provides a brief tutorial in assembly language programming using AVR Studio.

=== AVR Assembly Language ===

Some features of the AVR microprocessor can only be accessed with assembly language.

Assembly language will almost always produce the smallest code as compared to other compiled languages, and for this reason, it is a popular choice for applications that must fit into a very small code space.

AVR Studio is free of charge, but the program runs only on Windows, and its source code is not available.  Two particular free/open-source assemblers for AVR are [http://avra.sourceforge.net AVRA] and [http://www.tavrasm.org Toms AVR Assembler].

Programs can be SAVEd and LOADed to/from EEPROM via a File System and a self-start feature allows a program saved in EEPROM to be automatically run at start-up.  The LUFA (DFU and CDC modes) and OptiBoot boot-loaders are integrated into the project.  Pre-built HEX files are available for the ATmega88, ATmega168, ATmega328, ATmega2560, ATmega32U4 and AT90USB1286 at clock speeds of 4, 8, 16 and 20MHz.  Builds are available with and without the OptiBoot-loader (or LUFA) as well as builds for the ATmega32U4 and AT90USB1286 UART or USB for serial I/O. The full source code is provided as are sample programs. Older versions support the ATMEGA163 and ATMEGA8515/AT90S8515 as well as the ATTINY2313/AT90S2313.

{{Wikipediapar||protein#Nutrition}}

An essential part of organisms, '''proteins''' are made up of amino acids. Some amino acids can be synthesized by the human body while some must be obtained through food. Proteins are major contributors to cells' functions.

Protein is one of the nutrients that are needed in larger quantities (i.e., macronutrients) along with [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]] and [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]. Proteins contain 17 kJ/g (4 cal/g) energy.

Sources of protein in the diet include nuts, legumes, grains, eggs, meats and dairy products. Proteins have a distinct behaviour in cooking compared to fats and and carbohydrates. Proteins in general stiffen when heated, for example a egg yolk becomes more solid when heated, because it's rich in protein.

Some proteins are toxic for humans but become edible via cooking, for that reasons some legumes must be boiled before they can be eaten.

==Amino acids==

The building blocks of protein molecules are called amino acids. There are only 20 amino acids, but these can be combined in a huge number of combinations. The proteins are digested in the intestine, and split up in amino acids. These amino acids are later recombined to new proteins in the cells of the body.

The problem I always find on the gujarati pages of wiki is that I see the sign of ઇ (haswa ee) on the right of the consonants it should appear on the left of the consonant. I see ક્ + ઇ = કિ . And being a gujarati I know it should look like ક્ + ઇ = િક . When I corrected some pages on gu.wiki.org, it was restored back by somebody. So, I raised this issue. According to the answer of an admin of gu.wiki, my browser and of some font setting is incorrect. I opened gu.wiki on many other different computers and found the same problem. Could anybody help me please?

I have tried latest Internet Explorer, Mozilla (my usual program) and Netscape.

&quot;I'm tempted to say, 'Writing treatments is like designing a film by hiring six million monkeys to tear out pages of an encyclopedia, then you put the pages through a paper-shredder, randomly grab whatever intact lines are left, sing them in Italian to a Spanish deaf-mute, and then make story decisions with the guy via conference call.' But no... compared to writing treatments, that makes sense, too.&quot;  - Terry Rossio

==Purpose==
The term &lt;i&gt;treatment&lt;/i&gt; is short for &quot;treatment of bullshit&quot; or &quot;treatment of a concept&quot;.  While standards for screenplay formats and theories on screenplay structures are ten a penny, it's quite difficult to find any agreed-upon approach to treatments.  One person's treatment is another's &quot;synopsis&quot;, while some people write treatments that look like written-down pitches.  What your &quot;treatment&quot; looks like depends on its purpose.

In &lt;i&gt;Scr(i)pt&lt;/i&gt; magazine (Mar/Apr 2005), John Hill offers &quot;a sample synopsis/treatment&quot; which reads like a written-down pitch.  It's about 1500 words (or 5 pages) and it does a great job of explaining the movie.  But Hill then says this:

&quot;So, why write a synopsis or a treatment?  YOU SHOULDN'T. [...] Why not?  Because they are the worst of both worlds for a writer with a new movie story to sell.  They expose the idea but not in a form where a deal could be made (unless you're an A-list screenwriter already).&quot;

I guess the not-so-subtle implication here is that if you're &quot;an A-list screenwriter&quot;, you can ditch your subscription to &lt;i&gt;Scr(i)pt&lt;/i&gt;.  Hill's point is that people who are already well-established in the industry can get hired on the basis of a treatment, but for people trying to break in a treatment isn't going to do the business.

Well, it's an opinion.  Producer/director/writer Cauri Jaye points out that producers just don't have the time to read every script that comes their way, so a treatment can help them decide whether or not to invest the time reading the full script.  Arguably, if you can't sell your script via a treatment, then why should anyone believe your script sells a story?  And at the very least a treatment gives you a hell of a lot more room to show what you've got besides a bare logline.

I asked Hollywood script consultant Craig Kellem what he thought of Hill's position, and Craig said that &quot;it depends on the situation - sometimes it's needed&quot;.  To develop that idea: where it's needed is where someone asks for one, and is very clear that they won't read a script as an alternative.  

Where writing a treatment might do you actual creative harm is when you start your passion-project spec.  If you're writing a spec script, a good treatment may create a gloss that gets in the way of your creative process.  The glare of your sales vehicle can make you botch your craft.  (Okay, so it happened to me, you can tell.)  Hill recommends that for your own script development purposes you create a simple step outline rather than a treatment.

==Overview==

A treatment (or script outline) should adhere to the following:
* Take the reader through the story of the film. It must bring across the characters and events as they will appear in the film.
* It must not give more information than the audience of the film will have.
* It should go through each sequence, but does not have to contain every scene.
* It should come to about 10 pages for a 90 minute feature film (double spaced, 12 pt courier font)
* You can separate it into acts and sequences (with titles) if it helps.
* A treatment sells the film to both creative and financial minds, therefore it must:
** Grip the reader in the first line of the first page.
** Make the reader want to turn to the next page at the end of every page.
** Move the action forward and not linger on descriptions

==Style notes==
* Take all of the language into the present tense. i.e. not &quot;We cut to the Police Sergeant Joe Rawlins who is muttering under his breath&quot; but rather &quot;Police Sergeant Joe Rawlins mutters under his breath&quot;

* Remove any camera instructions to maintain the suspension of disbelief, this also means get rid of lines like &quot;The final scenes include&quot; and &quot;We are now deep into the third act&quot; for the same reason

* Generally 1 paragraph = 1 scene and you can link them with CUT TO: 

* Use dialogue now and again to help develop the characters and reveal plot points. put dialogue in novel format, i.e. quotes and paragraphs

* Take out any unnecessary items: for each scene/paragraph ask &quot;does this express conflict&quot; and &quot;does this move the plot forward&quot; if it does not either insert conflict or remove the scene from the treatment (and probably the script)

* As an addendum to this, keep the most dramatic scenes. This means skip the transitions and skim over the back story. Try and let the background come out as the plot reveals it to the audience

* Determine the point of view(s) of the story and try to tell it all from that point of view, i.e. do not reveal anything that she does not see or will not know very soon.

* Start on action, not description. This goes for the treatment as a whole as well as each paragraph.

* Do not use details about the functional characters. In fact you can probably remove them completely from the treatment as you should only reveal the broad strokes.  Remember that we want to tease the reader into asking for more detail, i.e. the full screenplay.

* Remember make it dramatic, dramatic, dramatic. We want to hear Beethoven's 5th in the background as we read, da da da daaaaaaa :-)

==Pace==

It should flow approximately like this (this comes from a textbook on treatment writing, it summarizes what I have learned pretty well, so use what you can)

Pgs 1-2  act 1
- Introduce protagonist
- Let us know (his/her) mission
- Set up the mood
- Give a hint of the protagonist's conflict
- Introduce the subplot, the plot-line that conflicts with the protagonist's misson
- Introduce antagonist
- The huge event that changes (his/her) life around

Pgs 3-6 act 2, part 1
- Protagonist reacts to (his/her) new challenge, and the decisions made lead (him/her) into action
- Protagonist starts to develop along (his/her) character arc
- Give the reader an inkling of what's coming

Pgs 7-8 act 2, part 2
- Protagonist's reversals continue, until (S/he) begins to make headway 
- Around page 8, new information that turns everything 180 degrees and forces (him/her) to face an even greater obsticle than the reader imagined

Pgs 9-10 act 2, part 3
- The characters converge
- A hint at the moral of the story. Maybe a place where all seems lost, where protagonist feels maybe (S/he) should give up. Here the plot and subplot begin to break up and we get to protagonist's darkest hour
- Suddenly something happens and everything changes. The universe gives (him/her) a break. (S/He) siezes the moment and goes for it.
- By page 10 (S/he)'s standing at the crossroads of action. (His/Her) next move will be definitive, the climactic turning point. Will (S/he) win or lose?

Pgs 11-15 act 3
- The crisis is the sequence of scenes in which the final outcome of the story is completely determined by the protagonist's actions. At this point it's like a separate story with its own beginning, middle and end, here we put in all the twists and turns. 
- The climax is the end of the crisis
- The resolution: the final moments (keep this short– end quickly and with a dramatic punch)

These are just guide points to help you pace a treatment. It will guide you in where you need to reduce the detail and scenes to make things shorter and where you need to add some meat. The screenplay will follow a similar pacing (just with more pages per act of course)

==Music Video Treatment==

A treatment consists of a written condensation of a proposed film or TV dramatic production. It covers the basic ideas and issues of the production as well as the main characters, locations, and story angles.

In part, its purpose is to sell the proposal to financial backers and major stars. Treatments should be attention-getting and interesting to read. They are written in the present tense, using active language and often read like a short story.

Treatments cover the full story sequence. They typically contain some key scenes that help to entice the reader and sell your idea.

Here is an example;

'''“Leap Year” Music Video'''

This music video is all about time and friendship, losing friends and those who never loose hope or stop waiting for those that matter. We begin by focusing on a boy, pondering a picture on a window-sill (digitally), the picture flies from his hand in a gust of wind, music begins. An montage of urban scenes flash by, starting with a sun rising very fast, mixed with short flashes of character remembering his two friends.
There are three main shots that remain constant scenes. One, a candlelit room with a large frozen clock taking up the entire background, where the boy occasionally sings along with mixture of mystery, longing, and sadness.
Next, a simple framed shot of the boy centered between his female and male friend, both facing them, only the backs of their heads and shoulder blades are visible as the stand halfway outside the spotlight .
The boy now sits up in an old, grey tree, centered in a gated off abandoned schoolyard. Numbers of a clock circle around him and certain things hang on the branches like a Christmas tree.
These very fantasy like, slow motion; whimsical, a little detached from reality shots of the boy striving to find the true friends as he remembers but not clearly enough. The girl friend is a manikin through most of the video, symbolizing how girls grow less honest of themselves around old friends in awkward meetings, and at the climax of the song she becomes real as he finally finds the way to see her the same again.
Now the climax of the song and at an abandoned closed down establishment the two stand together, Just beginning to speak, suddenly a car turns towards them, the headlights blinding bright. From this point on, several flashes, like camera flashes, creating a sense of the clock getting faster and slowing down to normal at the end of the video.
Finally, we see a close up of the character's hands reaching for on another, silloutted by a bright headlight.
This image fades to “The End” written in Christmas lights.

'''Summarizing'''

A music video treatment is the starting point of every project. It allows the production company to communicate its ideas to the artists and it allows artists to make decisions regarding the direction of their video. The treatment also helps production companies to write production budgets that are accurate and that give artists a complete view of what to expect when embarking on the production of their music video.

Making a film is a group endeavour.  You cannot do it alone and you will need to convince others to come along for the ride.  Sharing your idea for the film and the story of the film is called &quot;pitching&quot; and if you want to be a filmmaker you need to get good at it.

==Hook==

Describe your film in a sentence. Few have done better than the Alien description of &quot;Jaws in space.&quot; But beware - &quot;movie x in setting y&quot; or &quot;movie a meets movie b&quot; descriptions (known as &quot;High Concept&quot;) are becoming cliched. Don't try and force your one-line description into one of these if it doesn't fit.

==Use Descriptive language==

Be as precise as possible with your language. Which is better?

# Amores Perros opens with a shot of a dog. 
# Amores Perros opens with a shot of a slavering pit bull terrier.

When pitching &lt;b&gt;a film&lt;/b&gt; you need to use visual language.  Make the audience of your pitch &quot;see&quot; the film you are describing - sell the sizzle not the steak.

There’s no great mystery to scouting good locations for a film. There’s no template that tells you exactly how to do it, either. Many of the requirements for a location will be in the script. Finding them is down to marshalling your resources. If you know the area where you are looking, you are well on your way, If you don’t, a good starting point is people who do know it well.

Start with the local film commission. It is their job to attract films to their area and not just big budget films. You may be shooting on a shoestring today, but what about next time? Film commissions are keen to generate future film spend, so they will always be willing to help you stretch today’s pennies so you will be keen to come back. Their collective body is the Association of Film Commissioners International, found at http://www.afci.org/ Their website is a mine of location information and their on-line magazine “Locations” is packed with features on places where film has been shot all over the world.

When we were locating King’s Ransom in Newcastle Upon Tyne, Northern Film Commission were delighted to assist. From notifying them of what we had in mind to the day we wrapped at the last location, they did everything we asked of them and more. They emailed photographs of possible locations from their photo archive before our first recce and then spent recce days with us getting firmer and firmer ideas of what we were looking for. You will find them at www.nsc.org.uk

Their suggestions were always pertinent and they would follow up with calls to local estate agents to establish baseline property rental costs for us before we negotiated with location owners. Until we got a local production office established NFC acted as local referral point for everyone contacting us. Nearer the shoot they also helped us find local crew.

Other people who can come up with useful location suggestions include tourist offices, jobbing builders, delivery people and local council officials. When we needed to find a tidal watersplash scene for a pursuit sequence involving 4X4s, we asked the local Landrover club. They not only knew the places where you could drive Landrovers safely through the tide, but they knew which rivers you could drive up with a Landrover as well! Useful people to know. Their members also have 4X4s for rent as picture and action vehicles.

Draw up a standard location form on which all essential information can be recorded. It is a good idea to attach a sketch plan showing the location layout, access points, fire hydrants, water main, parking areas and so on. Also space for all the phone numbers of contacts people for that location. You will also need to make a risk assessment for the location, of which more later.

Having homed in on some likely prospects you have to consider aesthetics.

The location has to be able to meet the needs of the scene. Will it shoot just as it is, or will it have to be dressed for the part? In King’s Ransom, Mr Bright’s antique shop was in a former cinema and the entrance we needed to use looked like the emergency exit from a cinema rather than the entrance to an antique shop. The broad pavement outside dressed nicely with large antique pieces like a huge wooden mangle. A fresh painted trading title and a couple of pavement advertising boards turned the place into Bright’s antique warehouse and the location exterior looked fine.

==Location checklist==
* Sound
** Will the location be quiet during your shoot dates?
** Check with the local authority to ensure no building work will be running whilst you're filming.
** What are the acoustics like?
** If unsure, ask the sound recordist to check out the location.
* Available light
** Daylight?
*** Can you clean the windows?
*** In which direction do the windows face?
*** During which hours of the day do you get direct sunlight through the windows?
** Can you swap out the fluorescent tubes for color-corrected tubes?
* Power.
** can you tie into the local mains power supply?
** is it OK for you to use a generator?
*** check out the legal requirements for storing fuel.
*** Will people mind the noise of a generator?
*** where can you get fuel from?
*** Will the generator run on red diesel?
* Parking
** How much will it cost?
** Where can you park the vehicles so they won't be in shot?
* Check where you can and can not put gaffer tape.
* And, most importantly, does the location suit the script?!?

Taken from wikipedia as starting point...please edit to make more relevant to filmmakers....

Super 8mm film is a motion picture film format that was developed in the 1960s by Eastman Kodak as an improvement of the older 8mm home movie format. The film, 8mm wide, comes in plastic cartridges containing a 50-foot reel (about 3 minutes, depending on the film speed). Color stocks were available only in tungsten (3200K), and cameras were required to come with a built-in daylight filter, allowing for both indoor and outdoor shooting.

Amateur usage of Super 8 has been largely replaced by video, but the format is sometimes used by professionals trying to imitate the look of old home movies, or create a stylishly grainy look. Many independent filmmakers such as Derek Jarman have made extensive use of 8mm film with remarkable results, and it appears to have made something of a minor comeback in both the art and experimental film world. Oliver Stone, for example, loves to use it in his more recent films, such as The Doors Natural Born Killers, Nixon, U Turn, and JFK where his DP Robert Richardson employed it to evoke period or to give a different look to setups within a scene.

Until 1999, the University of Southern California's famous School of Cinema-Television required students to shoot their initial projects using Super 8, but the dwindling availability of equipment and processing facilities eventually forced the school to switch these classes to Digital Video. However the film is still used elsewhere by film students who wish to learn the basics of shooting film.

Super 8 is supplied in a light proof cartridge, the design of which allows it to be inserted into a camera without directly threading the film, which made the format even more user-friendly.

Kodak (as of 2004) still manufactures several color and black-and-white Super 8 films, and even introduced new emulsions since year 2002. The most popular Kodak stocks usually have been either Kodachrome or Ektachrome, and usually tend to be quite slow, usually around ISO 25, although there are known stocks that go up to ISO 100 and higher.

The Japanese company Fuji produced another variant called Single 8. The film was exactly the same as Super 8, but used a different design of magazine.

You can shoot on 16mm very cheaply if you want. If you wish to shoot on film, here's one way of doing that (prices are for the UK):

==Stock==

# Get yourself some [[Movie Making Manual/Short Ends|short ends]] AKA free film.
# Run the stock through a dip test to find out which cans are dud and which are usable.

==Camera hire==
Most large rental houses have some very nice people in them who are willing to lend cheapskates like us a decent 16mm camera kit for virtually nothing.  Just be honest with them - tell them you've done everything you can to raise the money and promise them a screen credit. Be VERY nice to them.  You could get an Arri SRII, with a set of primes and a handful of glass filters for around UKP 100 - 200 for a WEEK.  Try to avoid shooting in summer though as all the film students will be using the kit.  And remember to budget for transport - all those flight cases are very heavy and large.  And for God's sake CHECK every bit of kit before it leaves the camera floor and when you return it.  And I don't mean just check you've got the right number of boxes - look inside each box and tick off every cable, bolt and filter - I almost got myself in UKP 35,000 of debt because the camera hire company claimed we'd forgotten to return the remote control for the dolly (it turned out they'd screwed up and sent it to the wrong place - but I wasn't sure because we hadn't checked properly).

If you're really skint then try to blag a 16mm camera from your local film society or school.  Or, even better, find a Director of Photography who owns their own camera and persuade them of the genius of your script.

And budget for insurance!  No camera hire company will give you the kit without insurance.  Insurance for UKP 100,000 worth of kit for a week should cost around UKP 150 - 250.  Shop around for insurance - the premiums vary by about 200% between insurers.

==Developing==
8p per foot is probably the cheapest anyone will develop it.  (400ft of Super 16mm = 11 minutes at 25 fps ... so, if your running time is 10 minutes and you're using a 10:1 shooting ratio, that's 100 min of stock, which equals 3636 foot of Super 16mm, which comes to a cost of UKP 330.

==Telecine==
Return again to your bible (The Knowledge).  Find the chapter on [[Movie Making Manual/Post-production/Telecine|Telecine]].  Phone them and ask, very nicely, if they have any trainee [[Movie Making Manual/Post-production/Telecine|telecine]] operators who wouldn't mind scanning your film during down-time in return for a generous volume of their favourite drink and a special thanks on the credits.  Most will reply &quot;no&quot; or &quot;sure, that'll be £400 per hour&quot;.  But some will say &quot;not a problem, come round next Tuesday evening and we'll se what we can do&quot;.

See also the &quot;Amateur Telecine of Super 8mm Footage&quot; guide in the Telecine section for a cost-free telecine method. Before some wiseguys rush to say that the method is useless, I would like to make clear that this is an AMATEUR method, suggested for personal, non-critical usage only, not for professional use! And if one follows all the steps EXACTLY, he/she will get very good results. After all, it is free, trying it won't hurt...

==Guestimate budget==
So, a rough camera hire and filmstock budget for a week's shoot for a 10 min short would be:

UKP 100 dip tests + UKP 200 camera hire + UKP 200 insurance + UKP 330 developing + UKP 50 alcohol for TK opp = UKP 880.

The adage &quot;It's not what you know but who you know.&quot; is probably closest to being true in film. Writers need producers, directors need cinematographers and editors, actors need directors, everyone needs actors, producers need everyone.

This is the most collaborative of all creative mediums and the personnel often change from project to project - producers especially need a large network of contacts to succeed. Do not despair if you don't have a large pool of contacts as meeting, getting to know people, and turning casual contacts into useful ones are skills which can be learned. What you know actually determines who you know.

Although we all try to network, many of us in the industry could be better at it. This article is primarily written for producers but everyone from actors to zoom operators will find it useful.

=Why Network?=

Why make films? Why tell stories? We are filmmakers because we have something to communicate. Communication implies other people.

Perhaps in certain fields of human endeavour one can become successful through skill and talent alone - maybe seismologists don't need many relationships with others. For filmmakers however, social skills are as important as creative ones and to be effective in the industry it is necessary to assidiously develop both.

To work, raise money or get any recognition we must establish professional relationships within the industry, networking is the most effective ways to start off these relationships. For some people networking comes naturally but most of us have to work at it, and work at it we should for our careers may well depend on it..

=What is Networking?=

Having lunch? Speaking on the phone a lot? Using friends to find work? Using acquaintances to find work? An excuse to socialise rather than finish that difficult treatment?

Networking is not only about meeting people but also about building trust with those people and making effective use of our relationships with them. It is not good enough to briefly meet Steven Soderberg at an event and then send him a script - he probably gets that a lot . Networking is about building a *relationship* and to do that you need to help people.

The key to networking is helping people, selfish people are very poor networkers. If you are possessive about your time and contacts you will fail at it.

If for example you have a contact in Greek Television and you meet someone who happens to be making a film with a Greek actor - pass the contact on, the person you met will remember you and be more inclined to help you later.
Some help you can give people:

* Supply information
* Supply introductions
* Give ideas and advice
* Give personal support
* Give free or discounted services

An effective skill to learn is how to spot opportunities for others. Every offer we turn down as inappropriate may be perfect for someone else in our network. To quote Dale Carnegie, &quot;You can make more friends in two months by becoming really interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.&quot;. This is just another way of saying that the way to make a friend is to be one.

Networking is not a game so don't keep score. I once asked a friend who has been in the business a lot longer than I for an introduction and was stunned by the response, &quot;No you haven't really done enough for me to justify my giving that away.&quot;. This business moves in cycles and those down and out today may well be in a Tarantino film tomorrow.

=Who to Network With=

It is tempting to network with those people who we have a lot of common ground with and spend more time with them, forming close friendships. While it is wonderful and crucial to have friends it is only by reaching out to those who we may not have much in common with initially that we will actually build our networks.

These so-called &quot;Weak Ties&quot; are important because friends are likely to be exposed to the same sources of information as us and therefore don't have fresh news or relationships outside our circles. Those with whom we don't have huge amounts in common with will have access to other groups of people and other sources of information.

Don't network with dodgy geezers or dilettantes - they will sully the reputations we are busy building. A crucial element of networking is building and maintaining trust and nearly all effective networkers are held in high regard by their peers and have exacting ethical standards.

Selectivity is important in other ways. We will spend a lot of time helping our network of contacts so time is best spent on those who:

* Are good at what they do
* Understand networking and are willing to enter into the spirit of a mutually beneficial relationship

=Effective Networking=

Don't help one person by placing a burden on another, look for win-win situations.

I once made passing contact with a high level staff member working for Soros Private Equity (Venture Capital) and then promptly emailed him the CV of my friend who was looking for a job with a VC. This was premature. A better tactic would have been to, over some time, give him info about events in the high tech market he may have not spotted. This could have got him feeling obliged and relying on my information at which point I could have asked him to meet with my friend who was looking for a job in VC.

* If a contact shares interesting information that merits passing on we must ask how confidential it is.
* Always ask permission before passing on a contact's personal details.
* Let the person who gave us the information know the outcome of their introduction.
* If things work out show our appreciation.
* If we cannot help or pass on information explain why.

=Networking Online=

By subscribing to online groups and better yet contributing to them it is possible to make many useful contacts and perhaps even be remembered in face-to-face meetings.
Networking At Events

Remember that most of the others at an event feel just as out of place and uncomfortable as we do, try a conversation opener to break the ice. Closed question which supply the answer (&quot;Busy tonight isn't it?&quot;, &quot;You early too?&quot;) are nonthreatening and work well, this should be followed with an introduction and a business card.

To join groups of people conversing hang about next to the group and spot who's doing most of the talking (If I'm there chances are it will be me!) and when the opportunity arises ask that person a question, you will soon be included in the conversation.

It sometimes feels like we should meet as many people as possible but flitting from group to group is ineffective. Better is to concentrate on making a couple of meaningful connections at each event this will soon expand our networks.

=Networking Tools=

Whether it's a palm pilot, a mobile phone, a super rolodex or an ipod it is a good idea to use a system to keep lists of contacts current and backed up - digital is easier but not essential. A back up or a photocopy of the contact file is critical - knowing George Clooney is no good without his phone number.

To keep up contact with many people some form of system is essential. Recommending a specific system is beyond the scope of this essay but consider investing in good address book software or some form of CRM system and update and organise lists regularly. Like going to the gym updates are best if done regularly at a scheduled time.

Uber-networker Harvey Mackay organises his contacts daily and spends one Sunday per month going through his (thousands of) contacts, reconnecting with some and pruning others.
Business Cards

You need business cards - they are inexpensive, Printing Direct made me 250 full colour cards for £50.00, their prices start from £24.00. Having cards immediately raises your level of professionalism.

'''The Production Process'''

The following outline is intended to give you, the reader, a brisk walkthrough of what film and television production entails. You should not consider these steps exhaustive and must keep in mind that each production differs from the next, based on many factors. To confuse things further, these definitions differ from country to country. Many of the following definitions, for example, come from the US and mainland European industries and differ from the UK. Read and enjoy.

==Conceptualization==
The beginning of the process. Here the idea germinates. Investors and/or the conceptualizers usually finance this first stage, principally because it doesn't cost anything.

===Project development=== 
The conceptualizers, which may be a single writer planning a spec script or a producer or syndicate, put the broad outlines of their project in place. If they have started the idea from scratch, they write a [[w:Film_treatment|treatment]] to present the idea to others, followed by the writing of the full script. If they got the idea from a book or story, they seek to purchase the film rights and, once they have a signed contract, begin to convert the story into a script. 

Sometimes a director or producer will approach a writer with an idea. They hire the writer under a &quot;work-for-hire&quot; contract, meaning that the rights to the developed script remain with the person who provides the idea and the money to develop it. Professionals will usually provide the writer with a registered treatment of at least 3 pages outlining the story in detail. People new to the industry will simply tell the writer the idea in a few words. The writer will go off and turn the idea into 90-120 pages of plot, characters, dialogue, and action.

===Production Design===
The art director, production designer and/or producers decide on the overall feel of the production. This has a huge effect on the script breakdown.

===Script Breakdown=== 
The Production Designer and the producers dissect the script to identify how many of everything they need; i.e. actors, locations, visual and computer effects, props &amp; costumes.

===Crewing up===
The producers design a basic timeline and make initial wish-lists on actors, head crew members (director, director of photography (DP), gaffer, sound, visual effects designer, computer effects designer, editor and musician), locations and equipment as it affects format (b&amp;w or colour film, video or digital video)

==Finance==
This stage runs concurrently with conceptualization but can only really reflect actual needs after the script breakdown and production design stages have finished.

===Budget=== 
This tries to take into account all expenses for the entire venture based on results from the script breakdown and production design as well as budgets from similar projects. The line producer (someone familiar with filming in a particular geographical region) usually does the initial budget.

===Investors=== 
At this stage the project requires a second level of investors to commit to the project to carry it through to completion. The art of deal-making rules this stage. A good producer can raise millions based on how well they understand the distribution and exhibition controls in the industry. Small productions rely on smaller, non commercial forums of funding.

===Market analysis===
The producers and distributors clearly define the market at this stage.


==Pre-production==
Once the line producer completes the initial script breakdown, supplying the budget and schedule for the production, the initial meetings take place with the people involved and all the producers make all the 'final' decisions for the production. The line producer prepares the final budget and schedule during pre-production. Sometimes the 1st assistant director prepares the schedule with the line producer.

===First meetings=== 
The producers and crew heads meet to determine if they feel comfortable working together. As each has very different styles of working this meeting stage can make or break the production. Also the director usually meets with the major actors, determining if (s)he feels the actors need rehearsal time, or training (athletic, martial arts, military, medical, etc.) to play their roles.

===Locations=== 
The production team (in coordination with the art department) secures locations for the shoot. They determine time-frames and iron out all potential problems (seasonal traffic, weather, etc.) If the production shoots on a sound stage, the set design and construction begins.

===Props &amp; special effects===
The special effects team and the art department determine what they need to build, buy or borrow (miniature models, multiple vehicles for stunts and explosions, effects make-up, aged props and building, set dressings, etc.).

==Production== 
The executive producer gives the money to the producer to make the motion picture.  The producer hires the director who will control the performance of the actors.  The producer hires the cinematographer (director of photography) who will capture the performance of the actors on film or digitally.  The producer hires a production manager (or line producer) who then hires all the workers (the crew) for the filming of the motion picture.  The producer or the production manager will hire the sound recordist (sound mixer) who will capture the dialog of the actors.  The producer and the director select the actors for the motion picture with the assistance of a casting director.    Each day on the movie set, the actors and crew turn into reality the planning of the production.  '''On the set: Lights, Camera, Action!'''

'''Head crew''' &lt;br&gt;
Directors and assistant directors, script supervisor and location manager.

'''Camera department'''&lt;br&gt;
Director of photography, camera operator, camera assistants and focus pullers.

'''Lighting/electrical department''' &lt;br&gt;
Gaffer, best boy electric and electricians (sparks).

'''Grip department''' &lt;br&gt;
Key grip, dolly grip, best boy grip, rigging grips and grips.

'''Sound department''' &lt;br&gt;
Sound mixer, sound assistants and boom.

'''Art department''' &lt;br&gt;
Art director, prop manager, painters, set dressers, and construction crew.

'''Make-up/hair department''' &lt;br&gt;
Make up artist, hair designer, special effects make-up designer and assistants.

'''Wardrobe/costume department''' &lt;br&gt;
Costume designer (not on set), wardrobe manager, and dressers.

'''Visual effects department''' &lt;br&gt;
Visual effects supervisor and support crew.

'''Production department''' &lt;br&gt;
Production manager (not on set), production coordinator, and production assistants (PAs).

'''Support crew'''&lt;br&gt;
Medical, transport, catering, personal assistants, still photography, and behind-the-scenes videographers.

==Post Production==
On completion of filming (and even while it still continues) the editing team goes to work to start cutting the project together.  If you are interested in learning how to do these steps using your personal computer, see the [[Movie Making Manual/Education|Teach Yourself Filmmaking]] section.

===Developing /Dailies/Logging===
Every night during shooting of the motion picture, the film reels and the sound reels are sent to the lab. The film is developed and circle takes printed onto film or telecined onto video tape.  Then the audio is synced with the picture to create the dailies.  Or to explain it another way: The dailies are created by combining the visual image (from the motion picture camera or from the DV Camcorder) with the audio (the dialog) from the sound recorder.  To begin post production, a copy of these dailies are converted into the formatted required by the film editor and logged. On film, this is known as the '''work print'''. The editor never works with the original negative which scratches too easily. For digital films, this is called the off-line edit which is lower resolution than the original images which saves disk space and speeds up playback. For bigger films, logging means that information about every piece of film and every bit of audio must be entered into a huge database which is accessible by the entire post production staff.

===Editing===

===ADR===
Editors must re-record dialogue that cannot be salvaged from production in a process called '''looping''', '''[[w:dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]]''', or '''ADR'''. ADR stands for either Additional Dialogue Recording, or Automated Dialogue Replacement, depending on whom you ask. But don't ask why the A sometimes stands for Automated, because there's nothing particularly automatic about the process. An actor watches the image repeatedly while listening to the original production track on headphones as a guide. The actor then re-performs each line to match the wording and lip movements. 

Actors vary in their ability to achieve sync and to recapture the emotional tone of their performance. Marlon Brando, for example, was said to enjoy looping because he didn't like to freeze a performance until he knew its final context. (People have said that he mumbled during his on-camera performances to make the production sound unusable, so that he can make adjustments in looping.) 

ADR is a necessary evil when production sound is unusable, but directors can also use it to add new character or interpretation to a shot. By altering a few key words or phrases an actor can change the emotional bent on a scene.

===Sound Effects===
The sound effects (including the [[w:foley|Foley]], [[w:walla|Walla]], &amp; Ambience) make a scene seem '''real'''. Without the addition of sound effects, a scene would feel like it was filmed on a studio sound stage... which it probably was.  Sound effects recorded by a sound effects person are rarely used as is.  Instead, sound effects are &quot;sweetened&quot; and enhanced.

====Foley====
A sound effects technique for synchronous effects or live effects.  Foleying supplies the subtle sounds that production mikes often miss. The rustling of clothing and a squeak of a saddle when a rider mounts his horse give a scene a touch of realism that filmmakers find difficult to provide using other effects methods.   
The good Foley artist must &quot;become&quot; the actor with whom they sync effects or the sounds lack the necessary realism to convince the audience.  
Most successful Foley artists are audiles; they can look at an object and imagine what type of sound it can be made to produce.  The foley crew include the artist or &quot;walker,&quot; who makes the sound, and a technician or two to record and mix it.  
A foley stage often appears as a storage area for the studio's unwanted junk. Metal laundry tubes filled to the brim with metal trays, tin pie plates, empty soda cans, hubcaps, bedpans, knives, forks and broken staple guns. They use these crash tubes  for anything from comedy crashes to adding presence (brightness and naturalness) to something as serious as a car crash.

====Walla====
Walla is the indistinguishable mutterings of people in a crowd.  It takes a special skill to create a series of intelligible words with no clear meaning.

====Ambience====
Unlike sound for television dramas, a motion picture normally records only the dialog (the spoken words) during production.  All the other sounds are created in post production.  This gives greater freedom when editing the dialog.  Therefore, the natural sounds of the environment need to be added.  This is especially true if the scene was recorded on a sound stage at the motion picture studio where the background sounds are never natural or realistic.  The sound of the environment is the '''ambience''' and must be recorded in a real location.  Even though ambience is very soft in the background, a scene will feel flat without it.

Ambience is also sometimes referred to as &quot;room tone.&quot;

===Musical Scoring=== 
The musical score and the musical sound effects create the '''mood''' for each scene.  Writing the music for film and TV requires special skills from the composers, musicians and sound engineers; they all need a flair for the dramatic and the ability to envision sound. Even though the actors' voices adds a kind of music to a scene as they speak, adding additional music is often necessary to create the proper mood.  
It is often the director who tells the film's composer what moods he wants the audience to feel during the action and the dialog in the motion picture.

===Visual Effects=== 
Visual effects are any element which was not captured during filming that must be created later.  This can be done by computers (CGI) or by matte paintings.  When two or more elements must be combined (such as live actor shots with computer generated effects), the images are composited.

====CGI====
CGI stands for Computer Generated Imagery. This term refers to any element created within a computer and encompasses anything from adding digital fog to a scene, to generating a crowd at a stadium, to creating whole characters, completely animated, such as Gollum from the Lord of the Rings films. 

====Matte Painting====
Matte Paintings were originally hand-painted scenery on glass which was photographed along with the live action.  When using a matte painting which has been painted on clear glass, the matte painting sits in front of the camera while the actors perform on a partial movie set which can be seen through a clear spot on the matte painting.  The rest of the movie set is simply the painting.  Now Matte Paintings are created with hand painting, paintings using computer software, still image manipulation, and/or 3D models which have been rendered, and then the matte painting is combined with the live action by compositing in post production, rather than during the filming of the movie.

====Titling====
Filmmakers consider designing the opening and closing credits to a film or TV piece  as an art and skill in itself. Nowadays people's whole careers can consist only of designing titles for major motion pictures and television series.

====Compositing====
When separate visual elements on film are combined, this is called '''opticals'''.  
With computers and digital images, this is called compositing which is just like combining pictures with Photoshop.

===Conforming the Negative===
Once all the post production is finished and a working edit of the movie is completed and approved, the negative must be cut to match the working edit of the movie.  Only after the negative is conformed is the movie is ready for viewing in a theater (usually at a film festival) where the motion picture will be seen by the public (and potential distributors) for the first time.
If the motion picture was made with digital images, the movie must be rendered at full resolution (the on-line edit) and transferred to film.  If there will be a digital intermediary, the digital version or a digitized version of the conformed negative is color corrected and then rendered onto film.

==Sales &amp; Marketing==
===Distribution===
If the project has distributors on-board from the beginning, this process requires little more than sitting back on the part of the producers and investors, as the distributors practice their trade. However if the producers have not pre-sold the distribution rights, this can entail going to film festivals and/or door-to-door selling to TV, cable stations or video/DVD distributors.

====Delivery====
Once the motion picture has been sold to a distributor, the distributor will spell out exactly the elements that she requires to accept the film. Then the filmmaker goes back and prepares all these elements.  For very low budget movies, this can cost more than the entire production and includes such odd things as insurance policies for '''errors and omissions''' and a sound track for the motion picture which has been divided into three separate parts - Dialog, Music and Effects.  It is the distributor who will create all the foreign language versions of the motion picture and make all the necessary cuts and reedits to the motion picture to get it acceptable for foreign markets.

===Publicity material===
Marketing also requires the design of posters, audio &amp; visual trailers and merchandise. Special staff, like graphic artists and voice-over characters, work to produce these invaluable tools.   It is the distributor who creates the DVD-Video disk so the distributor must create the special features and publicity for the DVD-Video disk.  Hopefully, the production company has created and saved the necessary items need for the publicity such as '''production stills''' and '''documentaries''' for the DVD-Video disk.

Clint Eastwood never shouts &quot;action!&quot;, as he thinks it shocks actors and disturbs their concentration. Instead, he waits until the camera is rolling, and then says, &quot;when you're ready...&quot;

If you have done the casting correctly and your actor has the ability - let them express it. An actor will respond far better if they are given a degree of freedom to bring their creativity to the process.  A good director will encourage this without, however, letting it go too far.  The challenge here is to find the balance between allowing the actor to express themselves and serving the scene. The scene is part of a greater whole and their performance should be in balance with the other elements of the film.

==Casting Actors==

Next to having a great screenplay and a clear vision, casting great actors is the best thing you can do to improve the odds of your film succeeding. Casting good actors is 80% of the directing process because once you have cast actors who understand what they are doing, the director's job is almost done. [http://preproduction.4filmmaking.com/casting-actors.html External reference on Auditioning and Casting actors]

==Inexperienced Actors== 

Inexperienced actors nearly always err on the side of overacting, putting too much into the role.  Your task is often to convince them to be more naturalistic. Be clear and don't baffle them with technical terms. Explain how tight the shot is and their range of movement within the frame and they should be able to gauge how to behave.
One very effective way to get truthful acting from inexperienced actors is to let them improvise their own lines around a specifically designed situation. It works! Guaranteed.

Another rule of thumb is to compliment generally, but criticize specifically.  For example, telling an actress that you liked how she flipped her hair will cause her to do it again and again in subsequent takes, and it won't look as natural as it did the first time.  Just tell her how great she did and hopefully she'll unconsciously continue what she was doing.  However, you will want to be precise (but gentle) when pointing out the things you are certain you do not want.

Discourage the invention of backstories. They waste time. An inexperienced actor will either forget them entirely in the heat of the moment, or struggle to rationalise their performance, as they try to give it, by reference to some invented fact that is not in the screenplay, so that the performance cannot flow convincingly. Or, in other words: [s]he WILL overact, whatever you do to prevent it.

==Troubleshooting==

These tricks should be a last resort; the best way to work is through honest and open communication.  Being sneaky can sometimes lose you the trust of your cast.

There is a great story about an actor who was so nervous he was having trouble remembering his lines and was getting flustered. The director gave him a coin to flip and asked him to keep flipping it throughout the scene. This successfully made the actor less self conscious and the scene flowed after that.

If an actor continually overdoes it, quietly start the camera, keep it rolling and do a &quot;walkthrough&quot; of the scene.  Some of the footage might be quite usable.

Another tip: use action words to describe how you want the actor to play the scene. &quot;Play the scene as if you're begging your son to clean his room&quot; is different than &quot;play the scene as if you're threatening your son to clean his room&quot;.

The most intriguing part of movie making is music. Music is an essential component of any typical movie. Imagine a movie without sound - awful, isn't it?!

Different genres of movie adopt different music styles, for instance, soft music for a romantic comedy, crazy music for a comedy or jarring music for horror movies.

In the history of movie making, there are several examples of movies which were blockbusters, just because of the music! There are also many cases where movies have flunked due to poor music composition.

Music gives a mesmerizing spirit to the movie!

==What Is Editing?==

Editing is the process of choosing which picture and sounds will go into the finished film.  Initially this includes picking what is good and what is bad, removing the poor material and putting it into script order.  Later it also includes the creation and control of moments that may or may not have been intended during the shoot (see below).  This page deals primarily with picture editing, and the Sound Design module may be found [[Movie_Making_Manual/Sound_Design|here]].

==How do I edit a Film?==

What follows describes the typical process of editing a scripted drama.

===Logging and Assembly===
Watch and listen to all the material.  In a notebook make a log of your reactions to them and any ideas that pop into your head.  Use timecode to link your thoughts to specific shots and do not be fooled into thinking you will remember these thoughts later.
For a long project the first edit will be a simple version consisting of all the wide shots strung together.  This assembly will contain the fewest number of edits required to tell the story.  The assembly edit allows you to get a sense of the project as a whole before you begin to focus on the specifics.

===The First Rough Cut===
Now the rough cut begins.  Taking one scene at a time begin to work through all the takes so as to find the best, most consistent material.  The scenes may be cut in any order and the point is to let each scene work on its own.  When you have a good working version of a scene swap it into the assembly so the cut gradually builds in complexity.  Be sure to save versions of your edit several times a day so as to keep a record of all choices made.

Throughout the rough cut be careful to keep the sync sound together with its picture.  Do begin to mute or delete unneeded audio, but don’t bother putting in any additional sounds yet.  The first rough cut is completed when each scene has been looked at individually, and placed into the edit.

Take the opportunity for a break, overnight if possible, and view the cut without stopping.  Afterward take your notebook and begin to re-view the film, stopping to make notes of changes you’d like to try.  For a feature film this process can take many hours.

===The Main Edit===
Now the process of approaching a fine cut begins.  Scenes will have individual problems, and now that they are all part of one film, issues will become clear that are inter-dependent between scenes.  This stage of the edit can be difficult as some problems can seem unsolvable.  Be sure to keep moving.

Key sound effects and music may be introduced at this stage, and the complexity will grow.  Be sure to try out lots of ideas, secure in the knowledge that each version is safely saved and may be returned to if necessary.  The stage when a rough cut becomes a fine cut is not exact, but is often when the editor feels each idea has been fully explored.

Bring in others to watch your fine cut.  Merely sitting next to someone new while watching your film can bring out problems in the edit you have previously missed.  Pay careful attention to any questions they ask.  Even apparently casual queries can reveal holes in the storytelling that you and your team have missed or unsuccessfully tried to solve.  

===The Fine Cut===
You haven’t finished cutting until several new viewers have seen the edit and you’ve worked with the problems raised.  If there are major issues that are never quite dealt with then now is the time that you must be bravest with the material and experiment boldly.  It can mean going back to rough cut stage with a scene or two.

Fine cutting itself is the process of getting down to perfect frame accuracy for every single edit in the film, of making sure each moment flows as best it can.  Don’t bother working at this level of detail until all story issues have been satisfactorily solved.  
Once the fine cut is approved the picture is considered locked and no further changes will occur.  The project will move into full [[Movie_Making_Manual/Sound_Design|sound post]] and the editor’s work is done.  Back up all the project files.  You’re done.

==How Do I Edit a Scene?==

Look at the '''new''' section for [[Movie Making Manual/Scene Editing|How To Edit a Dramatic Scene]].  In this section, you will learn the specific details of creating the '''rough edit''' for a conversation and then creating '''L Cut''' and adding '''Cut Away Shots''' to obtain the maximum impact for a conversation.

==Software &amp; Equipment==

Films are edited almost exclusively off-line using computer-based editing systems.  These Non-Linear Editors (NLEs) allow for fast experimentation with ideas and the saving of multiple versions of films.  Although the basics of editing require only cuts and dissolves, commonly NLEs include tools for [[Movie_Making_Manual/Colour_Grading|colour grading]], [[w:Chromakey|keying]], speed effects and sound mixing.

These programs allow you to import raw digital video footage from many types of files, or to record in from tape.  You can then edit the video using a timeline, which is where the story is built up.  The program then allows you to play out the final edit onto tape, or to export the edited video in the form of a digital video file.

==A Short History of the Craft of Editing==

Editing is unique amongst the creative arts.  At the beginning of cinema at the end of the 1800s, there were writers, actors, directors, producers, set designers, musicians and choreographers all from the stage.  Even use of the new technology, the motion picture camera, was a straightforward step from stills photography.  But there were no editors.  Those that share the name, literary editors, share some of the concerns of film editors such as story and coherence, but in film parlance they are more akin to producers than editors.

===Origins===
Then one day a gentleman was filming a street scene and the camera jammed, as those hand-made machines did quite regularly.  After fixing the problem the filmmaker continued to film the street.  On developing the film, he discovered that a carriage in the centre of the road seemed to disappear before his very eyes.  Much enamoured with this trick, he used it to great effect and other filmmakers copied the technique.  This was the first known edit.

===As a Special Effect===
Among the finest exponents of this new technique was a stage magician named [[w:George_Melies|George Melies]] who created such lavish fantasies a ''La Voyage Dans La Lune''.  It was the Titanic of its day, of great length, with astonishing special effects, excitement, laughter and tense drama.  In it, cuts are used more often as an effect device than in the narrative sense that we are used to today.

===Telling a Story===
It was the American [[w:Edwin_Porter|Edwin S. Porter]] who created the first cinematic narrative box-office hit ''The Great Train Robbery''.  Although scenes were still largely played in long shot as if performed on a stage, the scenes of the hero riding to the rescue were intercut with scenes of the girl being terrorised by the hoodlums.  Narrative editing had begun!

===New Russian Ideas===
Russia is our next stop in the history of editing.  In Russia in the teens and twenties filmmakers such as [[w:Dziga_Vertov|Vertov]], [[w:Lev_Kuleshov|Kuleshov]] and [[w:Sergei_Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] experimented with editing styles.  The influence of Vertov’s apparently random connection of images can be seen in modern documentaries such as [[w:Koyaanisquatsi|Koyaanisquatsi]] and [[w:Baraka_%28film%29|Baraka]].  Eisenstein's almost brutal editing of images looked forward to the editing of today's action blockbusters and Kuleshov managed to codify Russian Montage Theory (or Intellectual Montage) to demonstrate how editing, through juxtaposition, creates meaning from two or more separate pieces of film.

In a [[w:Kuleshov_Experiment|famous experiment]], Kuleshov showed how by cutting from a man’s face to a bowl of hot food, the emotion of hunger was conveyed to the audience.  These two shots had not been filmed at the same time and so it was entirely through editing their meaning was created. Now the real magic happened.  Kuleshov used a close-up of the same actor and cut it with a pretty girl, showing affection.  It was in fact the ''exact'' same shot of the actor that the audiences were interpreting as two different performances.  Kuleshov had demonstrated that control of film's meaning lies in the control of the edit.

===The Dominant Style===
[[w:DW_Griffith|D.W. Griffith]] and other pioneers of American Cinema through the 1920s settled into using what is now considered the Classical Narrative style of filmmaking, in which editing aspires to be invisible to the audience.  This style of editing (also known as [[w:Continuity_editing|continuity editing]]) has become so dominant across the world that to use other styles is seen as radical and even anti-commercial.

Silly as it may seem, the rating boards of various countries have lists of words and screen content that determine the rating of a movie and whether one can broadcast it publicly. You may want to keep these in mind when writing.

The ratings in the US, Asia, the Middle East and Europe vary, and are mainly based on sexual content. Europe remains the most liberal, followed by - respectively - Asia, the United Kingdom (separate from the rest of Europe), the United States, and the Middle East (which is &lt;i&gt;extremely&lt;/i&gt; strict, with the exception of Israel).

Here we have a list of some of the general rules of language and content that helps writers/producers avoid the 17 years and up rating in English language films in the US (accepted by most other territories):

The standard regarding violence is that there cannot be any blood movement. This means no blood dripping, exploding or in any way moving from a body if shot, stabbed or hurt in any way.

No nudity allowed including: no visible nipples or genitals, though nowadays the occasional shot of the buttocks or the side of a breast may slip by unnoticed.

UNACCEPTABLE TERMS
* dick head
* shit, eat shit, shitting me, etc
* Jesus, For Christ Sakes or any other insulting refrence to religions
* Brass Balls or any other reference to testicles
* fuck, motherfucker, etc
* cunt
* piss
* cock
* tits
* ass-anything (though &quot;ass&quot; is deemed acceptable)

ACCEPTABLE TERMS
* ass
* son of a bitch (though not in excess)
* hell
* kiss my ass (when used sparingly)
* oh my god (acceptable since ''[[Wikipedia:Friends|Friends]]'')

DVDs have been with us for some time now yet the impact of the new format is just beginning to be felt and its potential just beginning to be explored.

The DVD player has entered the Guinness Book as the &quot;fastest growing paid-for consumer electronics format of all time&quot;. There are now 15 million DVD capable devices in the UK and this year for the first time more films will be watched on DVD than in all the other mediums combined.

&quot;Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism&quot; a direct to DVD documentary about Fox News is currently ranked 3rd on Amazon's DVD sales chart, just behind &quot;The Complete Star Wars Trilogy&quot; boxed set. So far it has sold over 250 000 copies on DVD - its budget was just USD300 000.

In the UK Luke Morris found no takers for the great short film he produced, &quot;J'Taime John Wayne&quot; and so packaged it with 15 other UK shorts to create the excellent Cinema16 UK directors DVD. This proved a such a success it was followed this year by a collection of 16 shorts by European directors on DVD.[2]

Most independent films lose money in the cinema. Prints cost USD5000 each, advertising with only a website, posters and postcards will cost tens of thousands and Exhibitors take a large chunk of revenues. When I say &quot;lose money&quot; I'm even not talking about losing money relative to the film's budget but actually losing money on the release. DVDs have much higher margins and this is where distributors look to recoup their payments.

The current justification for cinema release is that a high profile cinema release is essential if the film is going to do well on DVD. Yet most independent movies get anything but a high profile release, going out on a handful of screens with a marketing campaign consisting of postcards in pubs and posters on a few buses...if you're lucky.

The DVD success of &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; following their lacklustre cinema showings contradict the view that cinema success is crucial to DVD success. If the purpose is marketing the money spent on the theatrical release could probably be spent in a more focused way on selling/promoting the DVD. The problem is no one in the industry really knows how to sell DVDs yet.

For most of us Shooters the viability of a cinema release is a moot point as the budgets we are currently able to raise probably dictate a straight to DVD release anyway. If that is successful we might just be able to raise the capital for something which will go first to the cinema. In order for it to be successful the film needs to be good (of course!) but the DVD release also needs to be handled properly.

This is where the industry is pretty immature.

==What is still needed==

Realistically speaking there should be far more direct to DVD distributors than there are. The costs and infrastructure required for a company distributing DVDs directly are probably similar to those of a small book or music publisher yet there are far fewer small DVD distributors than small music or book publishers. In fact small book and music publishers might be just the people to push the next wave of films going out via direct DVD distribution.

In order to truly take advantage of this shift the industry still needs a number of things:

===Accurate DVD sales figures===

Knowing how many copies of a particular movie are being sold would be invaluable, far more useful than the box office figures. Yet box office figures are readily available while DVD sales figures are not.

Having the sales figures will make it easier to know what kind of budgets are realistic for different films and help immensely with funding plans for ultra-indie features.

===Distributors/Publishers with accessibility to the retail channels===

Sure we can sell from our website and via eBay and Amazon. But people
don't often buy products on a first viewing. Often we see something and
think &quot;That's interesting maybe...&quot; and the actual purchase happens after
a few encounters.

Being able to partner with companies who know how to get our films on the racks at HMV, Virgin, and Waterstones would be very useful.

===Reviews and feedback===

I touched on this last week. The more films are out there the more people are going to rely on trusted reviewers to find out what is worth buying/renting. Support of critics and online reviewers will be crucial in selling our films.

===Innovative Marketing Companies===

Are there any small marketing companies using creative means to sell DVDs? I've not seen any evidence of their work. Is there a company who could actually make something happen on a marketing budget of say GBP30 000? From what I've heard most of the independent firms marketing firms in the UK seem to be tied to the concept of cinema marketing and fairly formulaic in their approaches.

We need companies who can help a direct to DVD film get the attention of its audience. Again independent music promoters (Why have I seen no fly postings for indie DVDs?) and book publishers may have the skills in reaching a niche audience that film marketers have yet to develop.

I think there are still a lot of blanks to be filled in in the DVD distribution ecosystem and a lot of opportunity here. The sooner companies start taking advantage of these opportunities the better it'll be for us.

This is currently seen as a niche, but companies like [[wikipedia:Filmbay]] are already addressing this.

Note:  This section should be called &quot;Film Distribution &amp; Marketing&quot;.

What happens to your motion picture once you are finished?  How does your movie get into the hands of a distributor?  How does the distributor get the movie into the hands of the exhibitor or in the case of video tape/disks, into the hands of retail stores?  And how does the distributor/theater owner convince the public to attend your movie and to buy the tape/disk?

All of this is called &quot;Marketing&quot;.

==Finding a Distributor==

Probably 99% of all the motion picture which are distributed use a distributor.  If a filmmaker cannot find a distributor, the movie will probably never be distributed.  Probably 40% of all movies made never find a distributor.  So don't assume that finding a distributor will be automatic.

The distributor uses the economics of volume to market motion pictures as cheaply as possible.  Even so, the successful motion picture will cost 33% of the final gross just for marketing and distribution.  If you try to distribute the movie yourself, the cost can be far more than the income.

Back when you began to make your movie and you went looking for funding, one of the major options you had was getting a distributor on board early.  Be sure to read Roger Corman's books and notice that he always had a distributor before he began a movie.  It make life so much easier.

A good way to interest a distributor is to have a major star attached to your project.  Currently, the market for motion picture is &quot;Star Driven&quot; which means that the public is attracted to movies which have stars rather than good ideas.

If you cannot get a distributor while you are still in the pre-production stage, your only other practical option is to complete you motion picture and show the movie at film festivals to attract a distributor.

==Self Distribution==

If you want to try to distribute the movie yourself, you must consider your options which are booking directly at a movie theater (either by negotiating a box office split with a theater owner, or renting it for a length of time - also known as &quot;four walling&quot;), [[Movie Making Manual/Distributing Direct|Distributing Direct]], [[Movie Making Manual/Selling Online|Selling Online]], [[Movie Making Manual/Digital Cinema Distribution|Digital Cinema Distribution]], [[Movie Making Manual/Submitting to a broadcaster|Submitting to a broadcaster]], [[Movie Making Manual/Sales and Exhibition/Putting Videos Online|Putting videos online]], [[Movie Making Manual/Burning a DVD|Burning a DVD]]. The process of self distribution is time consuming, requires an additional financial investment, and is a separate business from filmmaking. However, it permits the filmmaker maximal control over how their work is marketed and the highest return on the dollar. An initial successful self distribution of a film can increase the filmmaker's leverage in securing a distribution deal.

==Delivery of the Film to the Distributor==

When you complete your movie and project your movie at a film festival, you movie is not finished yet.  You still do not have all the elements that are needed by the distributor '''before''' the distributor will accept your motion picture. These items are known as deliverables.  Now, you have to worry about technical deliverables (such as separate tracks of music and sound effects, known as M&amp;E Tracks) and legal deliverables (such as obtaining an &quot;Errors and Omissions&quot; insurance policy.)  If you have not planned for this day, you can be in deep trouble.   All of this might cost you more than the cost of filming and editing your motion picture.

==Developing the Campaign==

Finally, we get to the most controversial part of film marketing.  To sell a motion picture (with its huge advertising budget), a campaign must be created to introduce the movie to the public.  The basic questions are, &quot;What is this movie about?&quot; and &quot;Who will want to see this movie?&quot;

In general, many filmmakers and critics at large, do not like the ad campaigns.  But then, they are not paying for any of the millions of dollars that will be spend on the ad campaign.  So they complain and gripe and produce meaningless dribble like this: 

==Get on the Cluetrain==

Markets are conversations. Their members communicate in language that is natural, open, honest, direct, funny and often shocking. Whether explaining or complaining, joking or serious, the human voice is unmistakably genuine. It can't be faked.

Most film blurbs, on the other hand, only know how to talk in the soothing, humorless monotone of the clever line, marketing brochure, and your-call-is-important-to-us busy signal. Same old tone, same old lies. No wonder networked markets have no respect for Studio marketing hype unable or unwilling to speak as they do.

But learning to speak in a human voice is not some trick, nor will studios convince us they are human with lip service about &quot;listening to audiences.&quot; They will only sound human when they empower real human beings to speak on their behalf.

==Marketing the Movie to Exhibitors==

The distributor must somehow interest the theater owners to exhibit the movie in their theaters.

==Marketing the Movie to the Local Audience==

With help from the distributor, the local theater owner will publicize the motion picture before the opening of the movie at the theater.

==Marketing the Movie To Tape Distributors==

The film's distributor does not normally sell the tape or disk of the movie directly to the Mom &amp; Pop video store.  Rather, the distributor must get a specialized distributor to put this in their catalog.  In the USA, there are three major tape/disk distributors for movies to video stores.

==Publicity==

There are many ways to publicize a motion picture or a television drama.  The most common are a movie trailer and a behind-the-scenes documentary.  The movie trailer is the least expensive and the behind-the-scenes movie can be very time consuming if not expensive.

Publicity is done by both the production company and by the distributor.  The still photographs (called appropriately, &quot;stills&quot;) and the behind-the-scenes documentary are paid for by the production company.  But the movie trailer and movie posters are normally paid for by the distributor.  Some production companies in search of a distributor will create their own trailers and posters but once the movie is picked up by a distributor and the advertising campaign is determined, the distributor might still hire one of the many companies in LA which produce trailers for most motion pictures today.

===Income Distribution Considerations - Publicity===

Should a production company help in the publicity for a motion picture?  This is a surprisingly difficult question.

In most cases, the distributor pays the production company a small fee up front for the right to distribute the movie.  Then the production company receives a royalty after sales reach a certain amount.  Therefore, it is beneficial for the production company to help in the publicity.  Also, the cost of the distributor's advertising can often be charged against the income due the production company.  So is it better for the production company to do as much of this as they can.  But once the distributor creates a marketing campaign, they don't want the production company creating a different image for the movie.  And worst of all, all of the rights to most of the publicity material created by the production company is now owned by the film's distributor so the production company can no longer use this material in many cases.

===The Forms of Publicity/Advertisements===

First, you have the tradition forms of publicity and advertisement.

====TV Ads====

Television advertisements are simply the movie trailer.  Therefore, the cost is only for the air time.  This is often the bulk of the cost of publicity for a motion picture.

====Newspaper Ads====

Newspaper advertisements (either paid for by the distributor or by the theater owner) are almost always created by the distributor.

Publicity tours are paid for by the distributor and the actor's contract usually specifies the amount of pay that the actor will receive for doing the tour.  This is particularly useful for film festivals where the movie has won an award.

====Website====

All movies now have websites.

===Editing Workshops = A New Kind of Publicity===

Now there is a new way to publicize a motion picture which is half way between a trailer and a behind-the-scenes documentary.  This new form of publicity is a tour of the movie set and the editing room for just one (1) scene of the movie.  To create this, the film dailies for one scene are turned into a movie which shows the filming of the scene in chronological order showing all the circle takes.  That way, the audience can follow along with the script.  Then a rough edit of the scene is shown followed by the adjustments to the edits and finally the finished scene with a film score.   Once people have seen how the scene was filmed and edited, they can participate in the making of the movie by actually editing the scene on their personal computer.

Currently, there are over 40 million people who have personal computer which are capable of editing digital video but they have nothing exciting to edit.  But this new form of publicity will not take off until computer companies such as Apple Computer get behind it since half the benefit of the Editing Workshop is for people who use the personal computer.

To look at this new way to publicize your upcoming motion picture, visit the [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop] and purchase their '''Technology Demonstration''' disk. This is a fully working example of this new kind of publicity for motion pictures or television dramas.  You can never have enough publicity for your movie.  This is one way which is easy to do, specially if you are editing your movie with Final Cut Pro or similar type of editing program on your computer.  You already have all the elements and you just package them in a user friendly way.

===Film Scoring Workshop = A New Kind of Publicity===

It is also possible to create an entertaining product for people who use GarageBand (which is free will all new Macintosh computers) which is edited scenes without music set up for scoring with GarageBand.  At least 5 million people have GarageBand but still no one has done this.  Look for it in the next year or two.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using a Dictionary==

Foremost, Latin verbs are listed using the '''present indicative first person singular active''' construct of the verb.  For example, to find the meaning of the verb ''amāre'', you must find ''amō'' listed in the dictionary. Some verbs like ''esse'' and ''ferre'' are highly irregular and use different stems to form the perfect tenses.

Nouns are usually much easier. They are always given in the nominative singular. If you see a noun such as ''vōcem'' and do not know what it is, do not fret. If you look for ''voc-'' in the dictionary, you will not find what you are looking for. The ending ''-em'' typically belongs to the third-declension accusative; thus, be aware that third-declension nouns have radically changing stems. Those that have the consonant ''c'' or ''g'' usually have the consonant ''x'' in the nominative singular. Thus the nominative singular of ''vōcem'' is ''vōx'', and ''rēx'' becomes ''rēgem'' in the accusative singular. There are plenty of other simple rules which you will learn through experience.

Words that do not conjugate or decline (like prepositions and particles) are listed under their only form.

==Exercise 1==

===Vocabulary===

#''affectus, -ūs, m.'', goodwill
#''confessiō, -ōnis, f.'', confession
#''dē'', from, about, concerning
#''liber, librī, m.'', book
#''malus -a -um'', evil, bad
#''placeō -ēre'' + dative, to please (''placuīsse'' is a perfect infinitive)
#''filia, -ae f.'', daughter
#''puella, -ae f.'', girl

===Other Difficulties===

#''quod ad mē attinet'', as far as I'm concerned
#''cum scriberentur'', when they were written (imperfect passive subjuntive)
#''quid sentiant'', what they think (present subjunctive in indirect question)
#''ipsī viderint'', (loosely) they will see in their own way (future perfect)
#''eōs placēre sciō'', accusative-infinitive construction for indirect statement: &quot;I know they [the books] please&quot;

===Passage===

Translate the following passage:

''Confessiōnum meārum librī tredecim et dē malīs et dē bonīs meīs deum laudant iūstum et bonum atque in eum excitant humānum intellectum et affectum. Interim quod ad mē attinet, hoc in mē ēgērunt cum scriberentur et agunt cum leguntur. quid dē illīs aliī sentiant, ipsī viderint; multīs tamen frātribus eōs multum placuīsse et placēre sciō.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Vietnamese, the adjectives (Vietnamese: Tính từ) always come right after the nouns they modify:

;''áo đỏ''
:red shirt (literally: &quot;shirt red&quot;)

They always say about the particular trait, the property of the noun (before it). They can have the &quot;phó từ&quot; (like the adverbs in English) before it (e.g:&quot;đã&quot; for the sentence in the past simple tense, &quot;sẽ&quot; for the sentence in the future simple tense, &quot;đang&quot; for the sentence in the present progressive tense,... for more, see [[Vietnamese/Tense|Tense]])

;''Lúc này, thành phố đang rất yên tĩnh.''
:Now, the city is very quiet. ''(in present progressive tense)''

The adjectives can separate to two main kind:
*'''The adjectives mean the relative particular trait:''' They can go with &quot;rất&quot; (very), &quot;hơi&quot; (quite), etc.
*'''The adjectives mean the absolute particular trait:''' They can't go with &quot;rất&quot;, &quot;hơi&quot;, etc.

== Integral Domains ==
'''Motivation''': The concept of divisibility is central to the study of ring theory.  Integral domains are a useful tool for studying the conditions under which concepts like divisibility and unique factorization are well-behaved. In fact, they are very important for polynomial rings as well.

The integral domain was already defined before on the page on rings. We provide the definition again for reference.

'''Definition''' An ''integral domain'' is a commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1_R \neq 0_R&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;a, b \in R&lt;/math&gt;, the statement &lt;math&gt;ab=0&lt;/math&gt; implies either &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

An equivalent definition is as follows:

'''Definition''' Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, a ''zero-divisor'' is an element &lt;math&gt;a \in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\exists x \in R, x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a*x = 0_R&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition''' An ''integral domain'' is a commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1_R \neq 0_R&lt;/math&gt; and with no non-zero zero-divisors.

'''Remark''' An integral domain has a useful cancellation property: Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be an integral domain and
let &lt;math&gt;a, b, c \in R &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; a \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; a b = a c&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; b = c&lt;/math&gt;. For this
reason an integral domain is sometimes called a cancellation ring.

'''Examples:'''
#The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; of integers under addition and multiplication is an integral domain.  However, it is not a field since the element &lt;math&gt;2 \in {Z}&lt;/math&gt; has no multiplicative inverse.
#The set trivial ring {0} is not an integral domain since it does not satisfy &lt;math&gt;0 \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;.
#The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_6&lt;/math&gt; of congruence classes of the integers modulo 6 is '''not''' an integral domain because &lt;math&gt;[2] * [3] = [0]&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_6&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' Any field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain.

'''Proof:''' Suppose that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a field and let &lt;math&gt;a \in F, a \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;ax = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, then multiply by &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to see that &lt;math&gt;ax = 0 \Rightarrow a^{-1}(ax) = a^{-1}0 \Rightarrow 1x = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; cannot, therefore, contain any zero divisors.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Definition''' If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a ring, then the set of polynomials in powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients from
&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;
is also a ring, called the polynomial ring of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and written &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt;. Each such polynomial is a finite sum of
terms, each term being of the form &lt;math&gt;r x^n &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r \in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; represents the
&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The leading term of a polynomial is defined as that term of the polynomial which contains
the highest power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the polynomial.

'''Remark'''  A polynomial equals &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if each of its coefficients equals &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem:''' Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be a commutative ring and let &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt; be the ring of polynomials in powers of
&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
whose coefficients are elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain if and only if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is.

'''Proof''' If commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is not an integral domain, it contains two non-zero elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a b = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the polynomials &lt;math&gt;a x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b x&lt;/math&gt; are non-zero
elements of &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a x b x = a b x x = 0 x x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Thus if &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is not an integral
domain, neither is &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt;.

Now let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be an integral domain and let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be polynomials in &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt;.
If the polynomials are both non-zero, then each one has a non-zero leading term, call them &lt;math&gt;a x^m&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;b x^n&lt;/math&gt;. That these are the leading terms of polynomials &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; means that the leading
term of the product &lt;math&gt;A B&lt;/math&gt; of these polynomials is &lt;math&gt;a b x^{m + n}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain
and &lt;math&gt;a, b \in R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a b \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. This means, by the Remark above, that the product &lt;math&gt;A B&lt;/math&gt; is not
zero either. This means that &lt;math&gt;R[x]&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain.

== Unique Factorization Domains, Principal Ideal Domains, and Euclidean Domains ==
Unique Factorization Domains, Principal Ideal Domains, and Euclidean Domains are ideas that work only on integral domains.

===Some definitions===
*Two ring elements a and b are '''associates''' if a=ub for some unit u, we write a~b
*A nonzero nonunit a is '''irreducible''' if a=bc (b,c in domain)=&gt;a~b or a~c.
*a divides b if b=ar for some r within R. When this happens, we write a|b.
*A nonzero nonunit is '''prime''' when a|bc implies that a|b or a|c.

'''Theorem''': If a is prime, then a is irreducible.

Let a be prime, and let a=bc, so that either a|b or a|c. Without loss of generality, assume that a|b, so that b=ad for some element d. Then you can factor a=bc into a=adc, implying that cd=1, or that c is a unit.

Now that we have proven that all prime elements are irreducible, is the converse true? The answer to that is no, for we can easily obtain counterexamples to it. However, we will prove a sufficient and necessary condition for all irreducible elements to be prime.

===Unique Factorization Domains===
'''Definition:''' Let R be an integral domain. If the following two conditions hold:
#If a is nonzero, then a=up&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; where u is a unit, and p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are irreducible.
#Let a=uq&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; be another factorization of irreducibles. Then n = m and after a suitable re-ordering, each p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are associates.
Then we call (the integral domain) R a '''unique factorization domain (UFD)'''.

The converse to the above theorem holds true in a UFD.

'''Theorem:'''
In a UFD, all irreducibles are prime.

''Proof''&lt;br /&gt;
Let a|bc, where a is irreducible. Then ad=bc for some element d. Taking the factorization, a = ud&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...d&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = vb&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...b&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;wc&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = bc where u, v, and w are units. Because it is a UFD, a must be an associate of some b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; or c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, implying that a|b or a|c.

The following theorem provides a sufficient and necessary condition for an integral domain R to be an integral domain.

'''Theorem:'''
#Let R be a UFD. R satisfies the following ''ascending chain condition'' on ''principal ideals'': let &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, a_3,...&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of elements of R such that the principal ideals &lt;math&gt;(a_1),(a_2),(a_3),...&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the condition that &lt;math&gt;(a_1)\subseteq (a_2)\subseteq (a_3)\subseteq ,...&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists an N such that for all n&gt;N, all the &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; are the same.
#If an integral domain R satisfies the ascending chain condition, then every nonzero element can be factored into irreducible elements, meaning that it satisfies the first condition for being a UFD.
#If, in addition to satisfying the ascending chain condition, all irreducible elements are prime, then the integral domain is a UFD.

''Proof''&lt;br /&gt;
#Consider a sequence &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, a_3,...&lt;/math&gt; of elements of R such that &lt;math&gt;(a_1)\subseteq (a_2)\subseteq (a_3)\subseteq ,...&lt;/math&gt;. Then obviously &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1}|a_n&lt;/math&gt; for all natural numbers n, since &lt;math&gt;a_n\in (a_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt;. Then due to unique factorization, all the factors of &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; are associates of the factors &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;, counting multiplicity of factors. Therefore, the number of non-unit factors is a decreasing sequence on the whole numbers. However, &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; has finitely many factors, so there is an N such that for all n&gt;N, all the factors are &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; associates, meaning that all the &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; are also the same.
#Clearly any nonzero irreducible &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; can be factored into irreducibles, which is itself. Otherwise, let &lt;math&gt;a_1=a_2b_2&lt;/math&gt; be a product of nonunits. If this is not a product of irreducibles, then suppose that one of them is not irreducible, say &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then obviously &lt;math&gt;a_2|a_1&lt;/math&gt; so the principal ideals satisfy the relations &lt;math&gt;(a_1)\subseteq (a_2)&lt;/math&gt;. We can factor &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; in the same way, to obtain &lt;math&gt;a_2=a_3b_3&lt;/math&gt; as a product of nonunits. Thus, if &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; cannot be factored into irreducibles, we can get an increasing chain &lt;math&gt;(a_1)\subseteq (a_2) \subseteq (a_3)\subseteq ...&lt;/math&gt; of principal ideals, meaning that it does not satisfy the ascending chain condition.
#Let &lt;math&gt;a=sp_1p_2p_3...p_n=rq_1q_2q_3...q_n&lt;/math&gt; where r and s are units and each &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are irreducible, and thus prime. Since &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; divides a, it divides one of the factors, and after suitably re-arranging the second factorization, &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; can divide &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt;. However, &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible, so they must be associates, and thus can be factored out and replaced by a unit. We can continue this process until there are no factors left, at which point we conclude that all the factors are associates.

===Principal Ideal Domains===
Definition: a '''principal ideal domain''' (PID) is an integral domain such that every ideal can be generated by a single element (i. e. every ideal is a principal ideal).

'''Theorem:''' All PIDs are UFDs.

''Proof'':&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose we have an ascending chain of principal ideals &lt;math&gt;(a_1)\subseteq(a_2)\subseteq...&lt;/math&gt; and let I be the union &lt;math&gt;I=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty (a_i)&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously I is an ideal, and is a principal ideal because it is in a PID. Therefore, it is generated by a single element, &lt;math&gt;I=(a)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a\in I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a\in (a_N)&lt;/math&gt; for some N. Then if &lt;math&gt;i\geq N&lt;/math&gt;, then we have &lt;math&gt;(a)=(a_N)&lt;/math&gt;, so it satisfies the ascending chain condition of principal ideals.

Let an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; be irreducible. If &lt;math&gt;1\in (a)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; would be a unit, so (a) must be a proper ideal. If there is no maximal proper ideal containing (a), then the ascending chain condition would not be satisfied, so we can conclude that there is a maximal ideal proper ideal I containing (a) (Note: This does not require the Zorn's lemma or axiom of choice, since we did not use the theorem on maximal ideals). This ideal must be a principal ideal (b), but since &lt;math&gt;a\in (b)&lt;/math&gt;, b|a, and since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible, b must either be a unit or an associate of a. Since (b) is a proper ideal, b must not be a unit, so it must be an associate of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, (a)=(b), so (a) is maximal. However, all maximal ideals are clearly prime, so (a) is a prime ideal, which implies that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is prime.

'''Theorem:''' A UFD is a PID if and only if every nontrivial prime ideal is maximal.

''Proof'':&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose R is a PID, so that consequently, it is a UFD. Let (a) be an ideal of R, which in turn must be contained in a maximal proper ideal (b) due to the ascending chain condition (Note: again, this does not make use of Zorn's lemma). Since &lt;math&gt;a\in (b)&lt;/math&gt;, b|a. Since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible, b must either be a unit or an associate of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. However, since (b) is a proper ideal, it must not be a unit, so it must be an associate of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, (a)=(b), so (a) is maximal. Conversely,

===Euclidean Domains===

Definition: An integral domain R is a '''Euclidean domain''' (ED) if there is a function f from the nonzero elements of R to the whole numbers such that for any element &lt;math&gt;a\in R&lt;/math&gt; and any nonzero element b, that a=bq+r for some &lt;math&gt;q,r\in R&lt;/math&gt; and such that f(r)&lt;f(b) or such that r=0.

Note: In an ED, the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor is applicable.

'''Theorem:''' All EDs are PIDs.

''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose we have an ideal of R. If it contains only 0, then it is principal. Otherwise, it contains elements other than 0. Then f(I), the image of I under f, is a nonempty set of nonnegative integers. Choose the minimum x of this set, and consider an element b within I which mapped to this x. Let a be another element of I, and there exists &lt;math&gt;q,r\in R&lt;/math&gt; such that a=qb+r and such that either f(r)&lt;f(b) or r=0. Since both a and b belong to I, r must also belong to I since r=a-qb. However, f(b) is the minimum, so it must be less than or equal to f(r). Thus, r must be 0, so a=qb, proving that b is the generator of the principal ideal (b).

----
[http://struts.apache.org/ Struts] is the most popular framework for developing Java based web applications. Struts is being developed as an open source project started by [http://www.apache.org/ Apache Software Foundation ]. Struts framework is based on [http://java.sun.com/blueprints/guidelines/designing_enterprise_applications_2e/web-tier/web-tier5.html Model View Controller] (MVC) architecture.

== Preface ==

== Action Framework in a Nutshell ==

Within the MVC context the struts framework provides its own web Controller component and integrates with other technologies to provide the Model and the View. For the Model, the framework can interact with standard data access technologies, like JDBC and EJB , as well as most any third-party packages, like Hibernate , iBATIS , or Object Relational Bridge . For the View , the framework works well with JavaServer Pages , including JSTL and JSF , as well as Velocity Templates , XSLT , and other presentation systems. 

The framework's Controller acts as a bridge between the application's Model and the web View. When a request is received, the Controller invokes an Action class. The Action class consults with the Model (or, preferably, a Facade representing your Model) to examine or update the application's state. The framework provides an ActionForm class to help transfer data between Model and View. 

Most often, the Model is represented as a set of JavaBeans . Typically, developers will use the Commons BeanUtils to transfer data between ActionForms and the Model objects (or a Facade). Preferably, the Model will do the &quot;heavy lifting&quot;, and the Action will act as a &quot;traffic cop&quot; or adapter.

== Struts Config in a Nutshell ==
A web application uses a deployment descriptor to initialize resources like servlets and taglibs . The deployment descriptor is formatted as a XML document and named &quot;web.xml&quot;. Likewise, the framework uses a configuration file to initialize its own resources. These resources include ActionForms to collect input from users, ActionMappings to direct input to server-side Actions , and ActionForwards to select output pages. 

The initialisation of struts is acheived through the inclusion of the following in the web.xml file

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

&lt;servlet&gt;
     &lt;servlet-name&gt;action&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
      &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
      &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;config&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml&lt;/param-value&gt;
      &lt;/init-param&gt;
     &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;debug&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;0&lt;/param-value&gt;
     &lt;/init-param&gt;
     &lt;init-param&gt;
        &lt;param-name&gt;detail&lt;/param-name&gt;
        &lt;param-value&gt;2&lt;/param-value&gt;
     &lt;/init-param&gt;
    &lt;load-on-startup&gt;2&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;

&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
	&lt;servlet-name&gt;action&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
	&lt;url-pattern&gt;*.do&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

                path=&quot;/Logoff&quot;
                type=&quot;app.LogoffAction&quot;&gt;
                &lt;forward
                    name=&quot;success&quot;
                    path=&quot;/pages/Logoff.jsp&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/action&gt;
        &lt;/action-mappings&gt;
        &lt;message-resources parameter=&quot;resources.application&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/struts-config&gt;

There are several other resources you can specify in the framework's configuration file. You can specify validations for the ActionForms in an XML descriptor, using the Struts Validator. A standard extension, Tiles , helps you build pages from smaller fragments.

Struts Action Framework is extensible. Every class deployed by the framework can be replaced by your own default class. The properties of your default class can be set using the Digester's set-property feature. This is one reason why there are so many contributor extensions.

Tiles is a contributor extension.

== Features ==

=== Screen definitions ===
Create a screen by assembling Tiles : header, footer, menu, body, etc.
Definitions can take place:
* in a centralized xml file
* directly in jsp pages
* programatically in struts actions
Definitions provide an inheritance mechanism : a definition can extend another one, and override parameters.

==== Layouts ====
Define common page layouts and reuse them across your web site.
Define menu layouts, and use them by passing lists of items and links.
Define a portal layout, use it by passing a list of Tiles (pages) to show.
Reuse existing layouts, or define your own. 

==== Dynamic page building ====
Tiles can be gathered dynamically during page reload. It is possible to change any attribute: layout, list of Tiles in portal, list of menu items, etc.

===== Reuse of Tiles / Components =====
If well defined, a Tile can be reused across multiple applications.
Dynamic attributes are used to parameterize Tiles.
It is possible to define a library of reusable Tiles.
Build a page by assembling predefined components, giving them appropriate parameters.

==== Internationalization (i18n) ====
It is possible to load different tiles according to Locale.
A mechanism similar to Java properties files is used for definitions files: you can have one definition file per Locale. The appropriate definition is loaded according to the current Locale.

==== Multi-channels ====
It is possible to load different Tiles according to a key.
For example, the key could be user privilege, browser type, arbitrary name stored in session, etc.
A mechanism similar to Java properties files is used for definitions files: you can have one definition file per key. The appropriate definition is loaded according to the key.

== Prerequisites ==
Apart from basic understanding of building a web application. The reader is required to have some sort of working knowledge in the following technologies.
* [[HTML Programming|HTML]]
* [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]
* [[Programming:Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)|Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)]]
* [[../JSP|JSP and Java Servlets]]
* [[../Java Beans/]]
* [[XML - Managing Data Exchange|XML]] (Extensible MarkUp Language)

== Getting Started ==
Struts framework provides the following benefits over conventional methods of Web Application Development.
* Decoupling of business logic and presentation logic 
* Reusablity
* Maintainability

These benefits are gained because Struts provides a system based on the &quot;Model 2&quot; paradigm of Java web application design, while also providing a framework for the application that is cleaner than a series of J2EE servlets.

== Struts XML Tags and Attributes Reference ==
(The following list is in the same order as the [[#Struts Config in a Nutshell|example above (of a simple configuration)]] and the [[#Further Reading|example in link below of Struts tutorial on JBoss]].)
* &lt;struts-config - outer tag that encompasses the other tags.
* &lt;data-sources -
* &lt;form-beans - defines a section of forms that encompasses one or more &lt;form-bean tags.
* &lt;form-bean - defines a form :
** name=
** type=
* &lt;global-exceptions -
* &lt;global-forwards - defines a section of forward routes that are used, by default, in &lt;action tags. It encompasses one or more &lt;forward tags.
* &lt;action-mappings - defines a section of actions that encompasses one or more &lt;action tags.
* &lt;action - defines an action, which can have one or more forward routes (with one forward attribute, or one or more &lt;forward sub-tags) :
** path=
** forward=
** type=
** name=
** scope=
** validate=
** input=
** parameter= can be read from @struts.Action@ class by @mappings.getParameter()@
* &lt;forward - defines a forward route within an &lt;action tag :
** name=
** path=
* &lt;controller -
* &lt;message-resources -
** parameter=

      <text xml:space="preserve">The goal of this book is to create programmed instruction (PI) math lessons ranging from basic math all the way up through the end of high school math (usually trig). The idea of PI is that lessons can be learned in any order as long as subordinate lessons (pre-requisites) are taught before superordinate ones. For example, one would learn counting, then addition, then subtraction, then multiplication, then division. After this they would have the choice of learning either long division or fractions. After learning multiplication and division of fractions, one would have the choice of either mixed numbers or proportions. The content will be similar to the other math textbooks, but it will be presented in a non linear way. This way one can learn what they want to without having to learn extra material, and can learn the material in any order they choose. The challenge of this project will be figuring out what the prerequisites of each lesson are, and then directing the user to their options for their next lesson. 

Content can be freely copied from [http://www.planetmath.org PlanetMath.org], and any textbook in public domain (published before 1923) or released under the GFDL. Also note, the material on [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ MathWorld] is copyrighted so do not copy directly it as there have been legal problems with this website before.

If this project is a success then it will be expanded to other subject areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This is a book about AS (advanced subsidiary) and A (advanced) level Mathematics. It aims to fit in with the [http://www.ocr.org.uk/Data/publications/key_documents/AS_A_Level86696.pdf OCR New GCE A-level Mathematics] syllabus but is not endorsed by OCR. It should be useful as a revision guide or to find alternative explanations to the ones in your textbook. It assumes you have already done GCSE Mathematics. While it is aimed at people studying A-levels, it may be of interest to others in general. More information about A-levels can be obtained from the [[w:A-level|A-level]] article in Wikipedia.
===Course Structure===
====Mathematics====
*To be awarded an AS-level qualification in Mathematics, it is required that a student takes 3 modules. These must be C1, C2 and any one of the applied modules.
*To be awarded an A-level qualification in Mathematics, it is required that a student takes 6 modules. These must be C1, C2, C3, C4 and any two of the applied modules.
====Further Mathematics====
*To be awarded an AS-level qualification in Further Mathematics, it is required that a student takes 3 modules. These must be FP1 and any two of the applied modules.
*To be awarded an A-level qualification in Further Mathematics, it is required that a student take 6 modules. These must be FP1, either FP2 or FP3, and any four other modules.
A module may only be taken as part of a Mathematics '''or''' a Further Mathematics course. A student must therefore take 6 unique modules to be awarded an AS-level qualification in Further Mathematics. These 6 modules must be C1, C2, FP1 and any three of the applied modules. A student must take 12 unique modules to receive an A-level qualification in Further Mathematics. You must take all the core modules and FP1. Then you have a choice of taking either FP2 ''or'' FP3 with any 6 applied modules or FP2 ''and'' FP3 with any 5 applied modules.

Students at schools or colleges that do not offer the Further Mathematics A-Level can now study it through one of the local centres of [http://www.fmnetwork.org.uk/ The Further Mathematics Network].

      <comment>lableling what defines law 1 as later used</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''indices''' in this chapter heading refers to the '''power''' to which a number is raised. Thus &lt;math&gt;x ^ 2&lt;/math&gt; is a number with an index of 2. This is never normally said as people prefer the phrase &quot;x to the power of 2&quot;. Likewise, surds is a heading that is not often used. Occasionally you wil be asked to give an answer in '''surd''' form; this implies that you should give the answer in terms of constants, trig functions and square roots instead of working out an imprecise decimal approximation.


==Indices==
As you should know from GCSE, &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; is a shortening of &lt;math&gt;x \times x \times x&lt;/math&gt;. In the same way, any number to the power of n is that number multiplied by itself n - 1 times. To describe more detail, in the expression &lt;math&gt;x ^ 3&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the '''base''', and the 3 as the '''exponent'''.

By always reducing the expression back to its basic parts it is possible to come to conclusions about how to treat numbers raised to powers in algebra.

===Multiplication===
When you multiply indices you add the exponents together.


As you can see &lt;math&gt;x^3 \times x^2 = x^{3+2} = x^5&lt;/math&gt; .(law1)

===Division===
Division is, as expected, the opposite to multiplication. When you divide indices you subtract the exponents from each other.

&lt;math&gt; \frac{x^4}{x^2} = \frac{x \times x \times x \times x}{x \times x} = \frac{\not \! x \times \not \! x \times x\times x}{\not \! x \times \not \! x} = x \times x = x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Again this shows that &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^4}{x^2} = x^{4-2} = x^2&lt;/math&gt;

===Negative powers===
Having done the above division, we begin to ask ourselves what happens when we have a fraction that has a higher exponent on the bottom than the top.

Using the trusted method of showing each x separately we obtain:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{x^3} = \frac{\not \! x \times \not \! x}{\not \! x \times \not \! x \times x} = \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the just demonstrated method of subtracting the exponents:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{x^3} = x^{2-3} = x^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that x to the power of a negative number is one divided by x to the power of that number. 
The specific case of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x} \; \left( x^{-1} \right) &lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the '''reciprocal''' of x or more often as the '''inverse''' of x.

===Base raised to two powers===
When you have a base raised to two powers you multiply the powers.

&lt;math&gt;\left(x^2 \right)^3 = \left(x \times x \right) \times \left(x \times x\right) \times \left(x \times x\right)=x \times x \times x \times x \times x \times x = x^6&lt;/math&gt;.

As you can see that &lt;math&gt;\left(x^2\right)^3 = x^{2 \times 3} = x^6&lt;/math&gt;.

===Multiple bases to the same power===
When you have two bases to the same power, you can raise both bases to the same power and multiply them.&lt;p&gt;
For example: &lt;math&gt;\left(xy \right)^3 = xy \times xy \times xy = x \times y \times x \times y \times x \times y = x \times x \times x \times y \times y \times y&lt;/math&gt; which is the same as &lt;math&gt;x^3y^3\,&lt;/math&gt;. Here is an example with numbers: &lt;math&gt;\left(2 \times 5\right)^2 = \left(10\right)^2 = 100 = 4 \times 25 = 2^2 \times 5^2&lt;/math&gt;. There is a similar situation with division: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2 = \frac{x}{y} \times \frac{x}{y} = \frac{x \times x}{y \times y} = \frac{x^2}{y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Fractional powers===
What if the power isn't even an integer? Suppose you wanted to find &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, you could say that &lt;math&gt;{x^\frac{1}{2}} \times {x^\frac{1}{2}}  = x^1&lt;/math&gt; (by law 3, addition of powers) which means that &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt x&lt;/math&gt;. However it is customary to only use the positive root and so &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt x&lt;/math&gt;. You can use a similar argument for other such fractions, for example &lt;math&gt;\left(x^\frac{1}{3}\right)^3=x&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{1}{3} = \sqrt[3]{x}&lt;/math&gt;. In cases when the numerator is not 1 we need to use other laws of indicies to prove the square definition, for example &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{2}{3} = \left(x^2 \right)^\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; (using law 3), and &lt;math&gt;\left(x^2\right)^\frac{1}{3} = \sqrt[3]{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; (using the definition above). It's useful to remember the general rule that &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt[b]{x^a}&lt;/math&gt;.

===The 0 and 1 Power===
You may well have realised that &lt;math&gt;{x^1} = x\,&lt;/math&gt;. You can prove this by &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^n}{x^{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt; which is clearly &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;x^{n - \left (n - 1 \right )} = x^1 = x&lt;/math&gt; by law 2.&lt;br&gt; Also with &lt;math&gt;x^0\,&lt;/math&gt; we can prove that it is equivalent to 1, &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^n}{x^{n}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, but by law 2 it is also equivalent to &lt;math&gt;x^{n-n} = x^0&lt;/math&gt;

===The Laws of Indices===

The rules that have been suggested above are known as the laws of indices and can be written as:

1. &lt;math&gt;x^ax^b = x^{a+b}\,&lt;/math&gt;


2. &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}&lt;/math&gt;


3. &lt;math&gt;x^{-n}=\frac{1}{x^n}&lt;/math&gt;


4. &lt;math&gt;\left(x^a\right)^b = x^{ab}&lt;/math&gt;


5. &lt;math&gt;\left(xy \right)^n = x^n y^n&lt;/math&gt;


6. &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^n = \frac{x^n}{y^n}&lt;/math&gt;


7. &lt;math&gt;x^\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt[b]{x^a}&lt;/math&gt;


8. &lt;math&gt;x^0 = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;


9. &lt;math&gt;x^1 = x\,&lt;/math&gt;


10. &lt;math&gt; (x^m)^\frac{1}{m}= x\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Surds==
In mathematics, a Surd is an expression containing a root term, with an irrational value, that
can not be expressed exactly – for example, &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3} = 1.732050808...&lt;/math&gt; .

Sometimes it is useful to work in surds, rather than using an approximate decimal value. Surds can be manipulated just like algebraic expressions and sometimes it may be possible to eliminate the surd (called rationalising the expression), which may have not been possible if you tried to work with the approximate value. When asked to give the exact value, approximate decimal answers will not do and you will have to manipulate surds in order to give a final answer in simplified surd form.

===Simplification of surds===

Because surds can be manipulated like algebraic expressions, you can easily multiply out the terms and add the like terms. However, there are also a few rules that will be useful when simplifying surds.

===Basic rule of surds===

Because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {x} \times \sqrt {x} = x&lt;/math&gt;, it is useful to know that it can be rearranged to give &lt;math&gt;\sqrt {x} = \frac {x} {\sqrt {x}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {\sqrt {x}} = \frac {\sqrt {x}} {x}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Surds as indices===

Because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x} = x^\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; the laws of indices also apply to any n-th root. The most frequently used instances of this are laws 4 and 5 with surds:

* &lt;math&gt;\left(xy \right)^n = x^n y^n&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x} \times \sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^n = \frac{x^n}{y^n}&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}} = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{y}}&lt;/math&gt;

The first of these points is often used to simplify a surd, for example &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{200}=\sqrt{100 \times 2}=\sqrt{100} \times \sqrt{2}=10\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. In an exam, you will be expected to write all surds with the smallest possible number inside the surd (i.e. the number inside the root shouldn't have any square factors).

'''Note:'''
This rule only applies to non-negative numbers, attempts to involve negative numbers
might give absurd results;
&lt;math&gt; -1 = \sqrt{-1}\cdot \sqrt{-1} = \sqrt{(-1)(-1)} =\sqrt{1} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Rationalising the denominator===

Another technique to simplify expressions involving surds is to '''rationalise the denominator'''. This means removing a surd from a fraction. In the case of a fraction such as &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, both numerator and denominator can be multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; to give &lt;math&gt;\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the fraction is of the form&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+\sqrt{c}}&lt;/math&gt; the strategy used in the previous paragraph will work if it is slightly modified. This time you should multiply the numerator and denominator by &lt;math&gt;{b-\sqrt{c}}&lt;/math&gt;. If you are familiar with the standard difference of two squares expansion you should already know what happens next:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b+\sqrt{c}} \times \frac{b-\sqrt{c}}{b-\sqrt{c}} = \frac{ab-a\sqrt{c}}{b^2 + b\sqrt{c} - b\sqrt{c} - \sqrt{c}^2} = \frac{ab - a\sqrt{c}}{b^2-c} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
As you can see the denominator now does not contain any surds. For example:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{\sqrt{3}+1} = \frac{2\left(\sqrt{3}+ 1\right)}{3-1} = \sqrt{3}+1 &lt;/math&gt;

==Common questions and mistakes==

===Splitting up roots===

A common mistake is to split &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x + y}&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{y}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\left(x+y\right)^2&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;, usually whilst moving it to the other side of the equals. Trying a few examples will quickly convince you that this is not possible:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{64}\ \ne \sqrt{32} + \sqrt{32}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{25}\ \ne \sqrt{12} + \sqrt{13}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
And so on

===What is the value of &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;?===
The short answer is that for this course you don't need to know, and you can safely skip this section. If you're still interested then read on:

The question arises because &lt;math&gt;x^0=1&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and yet you would expect that &lt;math&gt;0^y=0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;0 \times 0 \times 0 \dots = 0&lt;/math&gt;. It turns out using a value of 1 is quite useful (perhaps even necessary) in various parts of algebra, whereas making it zero doesn't help at all. Almost all mathematicians would therefore either say that &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; is 1 or that it is undefined (that is, it can't be given a value).

== Test cases ==

I have had a list of common test cases transwikied from Wikipedia because I thought it could be put to good use in this or a similar book.  The list can be found at [[Transwiki:Common Test Cases]].  It needs a little cleanup, of course, but is in pretty good shape.  Hopefully, someone for familiar with this book than me can put it to good use.  Thanks --[[User:ThaddeusB|ThaddeusB]] ([[User talk:ThaddeusB|talk]]) 00:33, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

== The Style Leaves a Lot to Be Desired - what should I do about it? ==

Hi all!

I learned about this book, from a link someone placed on the my [[Optimizing Code for Speed]] wikibook. Now I agree that reading a good introduction on how to write a program should come before you start optimizing a working code senselessly. (I should note that I haven't encouraged such unwise behaviour in my article, just possibly not stressed it enough.)

In any case, I feel the style of this wikibook and its tone leaves a lot to be desired. It's very unofficial, quite condescending  not NPOVish (= Neutral Point Of View) enough (I admit that wikibooks need not be as NPOVish as the wikipedia and may be somewhat biased, but it's still an important partial factor). As a result requiring it as a pre-requisite to mine may leave a bad impression.

But naturally I should not complain if I don't volunteer to fix it myself, and I do. However, I'm not sure my modifications will be accepted by the originators of this wikibook, and so kindly ask for their permission, to fix the style and correct the manuscript. From my wiki-ing experience, I know that sometimes documents that I've started were taken to completely different directions that I've neither intended nor found desirable, which I didn't appreciate, due to a certain feeling of propriety. (Which I hope was not territoriality.). So I'm asking here whether it would be OK.

[[User:Shlomif|Shlomif]] ([[User talk:Shlomif|talk]]) 11:32, 10 November 2009 (UTC)

I find even the premise of the book a little skewed. According to the book title this is a book about learning how to program, but the contents assume familiarity with languages, so the topic is not how to use the languages to program, but about how to program in an industrial environment where you have Requirements Papers and such like already generated for you.

If we are going to discuss production programming, then shouldn't we cover more than just the basics such as refactoring, and perhaps cover disciplines like Top-Down, Extreme Programming, Agile Programming, etc. techniques? Should we accept the premise that language is not important to the book, or should we discuss the relative usefulness of a number of programming languages in order to give the programmer a background in modern languages other than the ones they learned at school, or should we discuss the use of Structured English, and Flow Charts as tools to organize the program. Perhaps a section on UML might be in order? How about a chapter on profiling and how to use it to determine where in the program you want to optimize?

Should we limit ourselves to just programming techniques or should we include Patterns, and links to the rich information sources that have been developed in relation to that discipline? I think that books that have to be used as pre-requisites for other books, should be held to a higher standard than this book seems to be.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 15:09, 14 November 2009 (UTC)

: Dear Shlomif,
: I totally agree with practically everything you have said.
: In particular, a good introduction on how to write a program should come before learning a bunch of optimization tricks.
: I also agree that this particular wikibook is not yet a particularly good introduction.
: Is there some other wikibook that would make a better introduction?

: We have many Wikibooks about specific programming languages -- [[Python]], [[Lua Functional Programming]], etc.
: I've been assuming, based on the title, that this wikibook &quot;How to Write a Program&quot; is intended to discuss the sorts of things that are important for every programmer to know, but are not specific to any one programming language -- and so get very little notice in those books about some particular programming language. Things like version control, automated testing, colored syntax highlighting, pair programming, handling bug reports, estimating time to fix a bug, estimating time to add a new feature, how to divvy up parts of a program among a bunch of programmers, etc.
: Some teachers try to teach these things before getting to the language-specific stuff, but it seems that these things make more sense to students after they've learned to write a few small programs in some specific language.
: ''shouldn't we cover more than just the basics such as refactoring, and perhaps cover disciplines like Top-Down, Extreme Programming, Agile Programming, etc. techniques?'' Yes, that is a great idea.
: ''Should we ... discuss the relative usefulness of a number of programming languages...?'' While such a comparison would be really useful, I think this book should stick to non-language specific stuff -- perhaps the [[Computer Programming]] book or [[Programming Languages]] book is a better place for those comparisons.
: ''How about a chapter on profiling'' Also an extremely useful technique, but -- perhaps the [[Optimizing Code for Speed]] book is a better place for that chapter.
: I want everyone to feel free to make any and every kind of improvement to this book.
: As long as you [[Wiki: AlmostNeverDeleteHumor]].

:: Well, I've started the rework of this book when I've ran into [http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/46078.html a little Browser-related Yak-shaving] and now I'm back. However, in the meantime, I've concluded something else. I had written [http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/high-quality-software/rev2/ an essay titled &quot;What Makes Software High-Quality?&quot;] (written in DocBook/XML and under CC-by - possibly wikibooking material) which contains four sections: an Introduction, a list of parameters of software quality, a list of ways to achieve software quality, and finally an evaluation of the quality of various [[wikipedia:FreeCell|Freecell]] solvers (the latter due to a quote that prompted the discussion in the first place in the introduction and my role as the primary author of [http://fc-solve.berlios.de/ a Freecell solver]). 
:: Now, while the section of the parameters of software quality was supposed to be as comprehensive as possible (and I would appreciate anything you believe is an omission), the other main section about ways of quality did not aim to be comprehensive, but rather give a taste of what people find useful. That's because it's
::# A huge subject. How to write quality software has been the subject of many books, and countless of articles, papers, essays, blog posts, mailing list posts and conversations.
::# A controversial subject. People don't seem to agree on what exactly is the right way to do things. 
::# It doesn't appear to be absolutely necessary for one's success (or alternatively to ensure one's success). In [http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html the Joel Test], Joel Spolsky says that «Of course, these are not the only factors that determine success or failure: in particular, if you have a great software team working on a product that nobody wants, well, people aren't going to want it. And it's possible to imagine a team of &quot;gunslingers&quot; that doesn't do any of this stuff that still manages to produce incredible software that changes the world.». The plentyoffish.com creator taught himself .NET programming and became a millionaire a year later simply because he had the idea to create a completely-ad-supported web-site, and was the first to market it, but its code probably had left a lot to be desired. And on the other hand, thousands of well-managed projects, products, companies and teams fail each year, and many great web-sites (like my own [http://perl-begin.org/ Perl-Begin] appear to be) still destined for obscurity.
::Back to the topic, if we are going to write a &quot;How to Write a Program&quot; or &quot;How to write Quality Software&quot; or whatever you want to call it wikibook, then we'll have a huge and controversial task ahead of us. Do we cover what we think are the right measures for achieving quality? Do we cover all possible ways to achieve quality and discuss the various opinions about them? In which context do we discuss this: open-source software, commercial software, in-house software, embedded software, games; GUI software, command-line software, libraries and APIs, web-based software, terminal software, client/server; by freelancers, by businesses, out-sourcing, off-shore outsourcing, in-house development, for fun, for profit, etc. etc?
::It's not an easy question, and I'm not sure we can start tackling it starting from &quot;How to Write a Program&quot; excuse for a wikibook. There are other much more commendable efforts in regards to FOSS development: 
::# ESR's [http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/ the &quot;Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;] and some other writings by him. (Open Publication License)
::# Karl Fogel's [http://producingoss.com/ Producing Open Source Software] - a comprehensive and good book about the topic (CC-by).
:: And naturally, there are many more books and resources about that for non-FOSS development. We should also ask ourselves if we want to add another resource. I think it would be more worthwhile to tackle particular aspects of achieving software quality at a time: [[Optimizing Code for Speed|speed and efficiency]], modular code, readable code, skimmable code, automated tests, tact and social engineering, publicity, picking up a good name, writing comments (or not - some people think code should be self-documenting) bug tracking/triaging/fixing, and other aspects.
:: I think that unless we're planning on tackling that huge problem by writing a definitive resource, then I can safely remove the recommendation to read this book from [[Optimizing Code for Speed]]. I guess I can add some text to the introduction explaining the context and risk of optimisation and pointing to relevant resources about measuring and achieving software quality. 
:: Would it be agreeable? [[User:Shlomif|Shlomif]] ([[User talk:Shlomif|talk]]) 23:22, 25 February 2010 (UTC)

::: ''possibly wikibooking material''
::: Thank you for writing that essay.
:::''if we are going to write a ... wikibook, then we'll have a huge and controversial task ahead of us.''
::: Yes. This is also true for many (most? all?) wikibooks. Have you seen the [[C++ Programming]] controversy? :-(
::: ''In which context do we discuss this: open-source software, commercial software, in-house software, embedded software, games; GUI software, command-line software, libraries and APIs, web-based software, terminal software, client/server; by freelancers, by businesses, out-sourcing, off-shore outsourcing, in-house development, for fun, for profit, etc. etc?''
::: Contexts where &quot;Use version control, automated testing, and colored syntax highlighting&quot; is good advice. That's all of them, right?
::: I think there's room for a small book that discusses these and similar widely-applicable programming tips, that we suggest people read just before the &quot;optimization&quot; book.
::: I don't think we should make a huge, definitive book on software quality a prerequisite to the &quot;optimization&quot; book.
::: ''There are other much more commendable efforts''
::: I don't understand. I agree that the current version of wikibook, like the current version of every other wikibook, is inferior to some other work. But I hope that future versions rapidly improve and surpass other static works.
::: ''I'm not sure we can start tackling it starting from &quot;How to Write a Program&quot; excuse for a wikibook.''
::: If you are suggesting starting from scratch, then I suspect you haven't actually read the links you mentioned.
::: One of them says &quot;it's almost always easier to start from a good partial solution than from nothing at all.&quot; -- Eric Steven Raymond [http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html]

Hi,
   I am Jyoti Basu, a software professional from India. I have been fascinated by this wonderful

A few tips to keep the crew happy:

==Food==
Never underestimate the importance of good food.  If your crew is working for free then you MUST feed them well and at well defined times.  If you're going to overrun then stop and ASK your crew if they mind working for another hour before lunch.  Always try to provide hot food.  Sandwiches are your last resort.

Good food needn't cost a lot.  See if you can get your Mum involved or your best friend's mate who's an out-of-work chef.  Remember also that some of your cast and crew (especially the clapper-loader) may have to work though their food breaks and so will need easy-to-eat food.  Oh, and don't forget to check on allergies.

Check here for advice on good food which is affordable and works on set - [[Movie Making Manual/Recipes|Ultra Low Budget production Recipes]].

Also remember to have a snack table (called craft services table in the USA). This may seem insignificant, however, film sets bring together very different personalities and egos, both technical and artistic, in very intense situations over a short period of time. Tempers will flare. They always do. Humans when upset or dealing with any extreme emotion in all cultures like to do one thing: put something in their mouth. A drink, a smoke, a chocolate, a thumb... whatever. The craft services table provides this option. Coffee, tea, water, donuts, pastries, water, chocolates, sweets, juice, fruit and water. Don't underestimate it.  Try to put the emphasis on healthy food like fruit rather than chocolates and crisps - junk food may give a quick 'high' but wont sustain that high so your crew will become irritable as the day progresses.

Another option (if you're lucky) is to get a deal with a local restaurant or pizza place, perhaps exchanging discounts on food for product placement in your film or advertising in the credits, brochures or your film's website.  Local pizza places are a good first stop. This can get costly if done too often. Some consider this option selling out, which is fair, however, it's not a bad way to get some grub for the crew.

No matter what your position on set try to offer others a tea or coffee whenever you can.  As a runner you will quickly gain the enthusiasm of others by offering tea and coffee.  As a more senior crew member you will show that you aren't a snobby nosed, status-obsessed fool in it only for the power, but a good natured human who likes to get along with people and do the best job possible.

But - be warned - never eat in front of a hungry camera crew.  Why?  The camera crew don't have the option of quickly picking up a sandwich because their hands must be kept very clean whilst on set and handling camera kit.  Once, on my first ADing job, I was casually nibbling on a sandwich when the DoP gave me a loud and public telling off.  You have been warned!

==Hours==
Don't overwork your crew.  Your job as a filmmaker is to get the very best out of your cast and crew - as a producer or director you actually do *very little* hands-on filmmaking.  So the best thing you can do is create a productive, exciting and comfortable environment for your cast and crew.  The one thing that will destroy the mood on set (and destroy your film) is exhaustion.  If your schedule demands 20 hour days then cut the script or increase the number of shooting days.

It is important to remember that the hours worked also include the 'wrapping out' time: not all crew just walk away when 'wrap' is called, spark (electricians), camera crew, grips, makeup, wardrobe and others still have a lot of work to pack up from the day and clean and prepare for the next day. So an estimated wrap time of say, 22.00 hours really means an end of shooting at 21.00 to allow for the wrapping-out. Expecting a 12 hour on-camera day to then be followed by an hour's worth of putting away the gear is a surefire way to spark a mutiny!

==Communication==
Give the cast and crew as much information as possible, especially when things are going wrong.  If you can then print and distribute the schedule to EVERY crew member at the start of each day, if not far earlier.  If you're going run over schedule then first explain the situation to your crew, then ask very nicely if they mind working longer and then tell your crew the new estimate wrap time.

==Drugs==
You can't stop everyone from taking loads of drugs but do your best to dissuade your cast and crew.

Drugs and alcohol on set will void most insurance policies. You must get your crew to never ever take any kind of extreme mind altering substances while anywhere near set. I would advise firing anyone that does not heed this warning. This has nothing to do with moral or social issues it has to do with running a business. Until the insurance contracts change no drugs or alcohol on set.

==Drinking==
This is a dodgy one.  Going out for drinks every night of the shoot is a good way to get to know everyone.  But don't over do it.  What you do as a director or producer is up to you.  You'll certainly increase your chances of getting on well with your cast and crew if you go out drinking with them.  But, then again, you've probably got to spend every evening preparing the next day's shot list.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Lucidish. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Lucidish~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

=What is Linux?=
[[w:linux|Linux]] is a piece of software known as a 'kernel.' The name has also been inaccurately applied to an entire operating system known as [[w:GNU|GNU]]. [[w:GNU/Linux|GNU/Linux]] is the preferred method of referring to the operating system. GNU/Linux is a computer [[w:operating system|operating system]] which can run on many different types of computer hardware.  GNU/Linux is the most famous example of [[w:free software|free software]].  It is developed and maintained by thousands of people around the world.  Most GNU/Linux distributions are gratis.  Please take a look at the [[w:wikipedia|Wikipedia]] entry for more info about [[w:GNU/Linux|GNU/Linux]].

==Advantages==
* Almost always free (or very inexpensive)
* Open Source (most distributions, but not all)
* Bugs are usually fixed very quickly
* Stable
* Fast
* You can modify it to your heart's content, learn from it and even redistribute changes.
* There is a lot of support available on-line through Wikis and Forums
* Developers are usually very open to suggestions from users.  Much more so than proprietary, closed-source, corporate software developers.  If you've got money to spend, then the developers will probably gladly design custom modules for you.
* Many software options for similar tasks.
* Many variations on the kernel for various uses depending on hardware, resources, and what you want to do on it.

==Disadvantages==
* Documentation is often a little sketchy depending on the distribution
* The Macintosh is the Industry standard for most aspects of film production
* Is again its own operating system and takes time to get use to (depending on your own speed of picking things up)

=But I thought GNU/Linux was bad for content creation?=
It used to be.  But it's grown up.  There are already lots of great tools for content creation on GNU/Linux (and, yes, lots of them are free).

=Why use GNU/Linux for film production?=
* Lots of film companies (especially 3D and effects houses) already use GNU/Linux.  So what?  Well, lots of these guys contribute code to the open-source world.  Free of charge.  So you and I can use code which has been developed at ILM.  Examples:
** [http://www.cinepaint.org/ Cinepaint], forked from the GNU Image Manipulation Program ([[w:GIMP|GIMP]]), is partially developed by Rhythm &amp; Hues, ILM, and Sony Pictures.  It's mainly used for cleanup, and dust and scratch removal.
** [http://www.openexr.com OpenEXR] is developed by ILM.
* It's very stable.

* Most [[Movie Making Manual/Windows in film production|Windows programs]] can be made to run under Linux using [http://www.winehq.com/ Wine] (which is free, and costs no money).

Everything which isn't marked as &quot;proprietary&quot; is gratis!

*Windows programs running under Wine

Besides dastoryboard, there are no free specialized storyboarding programs on Linux but see the [[#Still_image_creation|&quot;Still image Creation&quot;]] section below.

A useful technique could be to photograph and outline your actors with a vector graphics program, then reposition them behind photographs of your locations.
Check out the vector graphics section.

The program [http://www.celtx.com/ celtx], listed in the &quot;scriptwriting&quot; section, has storyboarding capabilities. You would still need to create the images as explained in the previous paragraph but they can be entered into a template within the celtx application. Notes can be added to the images as well.

The 2D animation software [http://www.maefloresta.com/portal/ Tupi] also has made steps to implement storyboard facilities.

=Personal opinions=
====Wish List====
I love Linux.  Don't get me wrong.  
I think the whole project is perfect and I use Linux all the time. I use Linux for everything.  Everything, including video editing.

My wish list is:

* Flash MX 2004/2005 on Linux (for DVD Menus)
* Adobe port Premiere over to Linux / Avid port DV Xpress to Linux
* There are many very promising Open Source video editing packages that one day may become mature enough to compete with Premiere, but I'm porting this one right now with Xen.

Once one of these wishes becomes true then Linux will rock as an NLE platform.

====GNU/Linux Multi-media forums====

I'm somewhat disappointed that many of the forums on GNU/Linux multi-media are very quiet.  The best forums that I know of are:
*[http://forum.doom9.org/forumdisplay.php?f=63 Doom9] Linux specific multimedia forum on a mostly windows site
*[http://www.videohelp.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=19 Video Help.com] Linux specific multimedia forum on a mostly windows site
*[http://forums.gentoo.org/viewforum-f-33.html Gentoo-Multimedia forum] Hosted on a gentoo-specific forum, but has a lot of generic GNU/Linux multimedia information (and relatively very active)
*[http://wiki.multimedia.cx MultimediaWiki] All about Multimedia
Does anyone know of any other good multi-media forums for linux?

== Motivation ==
In [[../Rings/]] we saw that the set of even integers &lt;math&gt;2 \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; was a subring of the integers.  

We can also see very easily that the integers &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} &lt;/math&gt; are a subring of the rational numbers under the usual operations of addition and multiplication.

The even integers, when taken as a subring of the integers have a property that the integers when taken as a subring of the rationals do not.  The even integers taken as a subring of the rationals also lack this property.

The property is that the even integers, taken as a subring of the integers, ''absorb'' multiplication.    Let's call the even integers &lt;math&gt;I = 2 \mathbb{Z} &lt;/math&gt; for ease of notation.

Consider the following:
For all &lt;math&gt;i \in I&lt;/math&gt;, we can see by the definition of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt;i = 2k&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  

For all &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; see that &lt;math&gt;ai = a(2k) = 2ak \in I&lt;/math&gt;.  

In English, regardless of which even integer is chosen, multiplying it by any integer will give us a different ''even'' integer.

== Definition of an Ideal ==
'''Definition:'''
Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, a subset &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''left ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;'' if it absorbs multiplication from the left; that is, if
&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in I, \forall r \in R, ri \in I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:'''
Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, a subset &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''right ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;'' if it absorbs multiplication from the right; that is, if
&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in I, \forall r \in R, ir \in I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:'''
We define an ''ideal'' &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; to be something that is both a left ideal and a right ideal. We also require that &lt;math&gt;(I, +)&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;(R, +)&lt;/math&gt;.

We write &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; as shorthand for this.

To verify that a subset of a ring is an ideal, it is only necessary to check that it is closed under subtraction and that it absorbs multiplication; this is because of the subgroup criterion from [[Abstract_Algebra/Group_Theory/Subgroup]].

'''Definition:'''
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''proper'' if &lt;math&gt;I \subsetneq R&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:'''
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''trivial'' if I={0}.

'''Lemma:'''
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is proper if and only if &lt;math&gt;1 \notin I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''
If &lt;math&gt;1 \in I&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;r = r1 \in I&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;I = R&lt;/math&gt;.

The converse is obvious.

'''Theorem:'''
In a division ring, the only proper ideal is trivial.

'''Proof:'''
Suppose we have an ideal in a division with a nonzero element a. Take any element b in our division ring. Then a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;b is in the division ring as well, and aa&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;b = b is in the ideal. Therefore, it is not a proper ideal.

'''Definition:'''
Let S be a nonempty subset of a ring R. Then the ideal generated S is defined to be the smallest ideal in R containing S, which would be the intersection of all such ideals. We can characterize this ideal by the collection of all finite sums

&lt;math&gt;\left \{ \sum_{i=1}^n r_{i1}s_ir_{i2}|r_{i1},r_{i2} \in R, s_i \in S \right \} &lt;/math&gt;

And one can easily verify that this is an ideal, and that all ideals containing S must contain this ideal. If it is commutative, then one can simply characterize it as

&lt;math&gt;\left \{ \sum_{i=1}^n r_i1s_i|r_i \in R, s_i \in S \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

The ideal generated by a single element a is called a '''principal ideal'''. If the ring is commutative, it consists of all elements of the ring of the form ra where r is any element in the ring.

'''Example''':
Let &lt;math&gt;R = \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; be the ring of integers. The principal ideal &lt;math&gt;(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; consisting of positive and negative multiples of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For example &lt;math&gt;(2)&lt;/math&gt; is the subset of even integers. Then one can view the factor ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z} / (n)&lt;/math&gt; simply as the set &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1, \ldots, n - 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; under addition and multiplication modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Operations on Ideals ==

Given a collection of ideals we can generate other ideals. For instance it is easy to check that the intersection of any family of ideals is again an ideal. We write this simply as &lt;math&gt;\cap_{j \in J} I_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Given any set &lt;math&gt;S \subset R&lt;/math&gt; we can construct the smallest ideal of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; which we denote by &lt;math&gt;\langle S \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. It is determined by &lt;math&gt;\langle S \rangle = \cap_{S \subset I \triangleleft R} I&lt;/math&gt;, though often we can be more explicit than this.

If &lt;math&gt;I_{j \in J}&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of ideals we can determine the ''sum'', written &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} I_j&lt;/math&gt;, as the smallest ideal containing all the ideals &lt;math&gt;I_j&lt;/math&gt;. One can check explicitly that its elements are ''finite'' sums of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} x_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally if &lt;math&gt;I,J&lt;/math&gt; are two ideals in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; one can determine the ideal-theoretic product as the smallest ideal containing the set-theoretic product &lt;math&gt;\{ i j \mid i \in I, j \in J \}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the ideal-theoretic product is in general strictly larger than the set-theoretic product, and that it simply consists of finite sums of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum i_r j_r&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;i_r \in I \; j_r \in J &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example:'''
Let &lt;math&gt;(m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(n)&lt;/math&gt; the principal ideals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; just given. Then one can check explicitly that &lt;math&gt;(m) \cap (n) = (r)&lt;/math&gt;, where r is the lcm of m and n. Moreover &lt;math&gt; (m)(n) = (mn)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(m) + (n) = (s)&lt;/math&gt; where s is the hcf of m and n. Observe that &lt;math&gt;(m)(n) = (m) \cap (n)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if s = mn if and only if m and n are co-prime if and only if &lt;math&gt;(m) + (n) = (1)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Homomorphisms and Ideals ==
Rings, like groups, have factor objects that are kernels of homomorphisms. Let &lt;math&gt;f:R\to S&lt;/math&gt; be a ring homomorphism. Let us determine the structure of the kernel of ''f'' which is defined to be all elements which map to the identity.

If ''a'' and ''b'' are in the kernel of ''f'', i.e. &lt;math&gt;f(a)=f(b)=0&lt;/math&gt;, and ''r'' is any element of ''R'', then
:&lt;math&gt;f(a-b)=f(a)-f(b)=0&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(ar)=f(a)f(r)=0&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(ra)=f(r)f(a)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\ker(f)&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal of ''R''.

Also note that the homomorphism will be a monomorphism i. e. it is injective or one-to-one when the kernel consists only of the identity element.

We also have the following&lt;br /&gt;
'''Theorem''': If the only proper ideal of R is the trivial ideal {0}, then if f is a homomorphism from R to S, and it does not map all elements of R to the identity in S, then it is injective.&lt;br /&gt;
''Proof'': The kernel of the homomorphism must be an ideal, and since the only ideals are R and the trivial ideal, one of these two must be the kernel. However, since not all elements of R map to the identity of S, R is not the kernel, so the trivial ideal must be.

Since this condition is satisfied for all division rings, it is true for all division rings.

The construction of factor rings in the next section will prove that there exists a homomorphism with I as its kernel for any ideal I.

== Factor Rings ==
'''Definition:'''
Given a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and an ideal &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt;, the ring of cosets of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, r+I where r is within R, is written &lt;math&gt;R/I&lt;/math&gt;, where each coset is defined to be the set {r+i|i is an element of I}, and by Lagrange's theorem, it partitions R. This set of cosets, called the ''factor ring'' (or ''quotient ring'') of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a ring with addition defined the same way as one would define it for groups (since the ring is a group under addition), and with multiplication defined as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;(a + I)(b + I) = ab + I&lt;/math&gt;.

To show that this is independent of the choice of a and b (or, the operations are well-defined), suppose that a' and b' are elements of the same respective coset. Then a'=a+j and b'=b+k for some element j,k within I. Then a'b'=ab+ak+jb+jk and since ak, jb, and jk are elements of I, a'b' and ab must belong to the same coset, so ab+I=a'b'+I. Obviously the cosets form a group under addition because of what was proved earlier about factor groups, and furthermore the factor ring forms an abelian group under addition because the ring forms an abelian group under addition. Since the product rs+I is analogous to the multiplication in the ring, it obviously has all the properties of a ring. Furthermore, if the ring is commutative, then the factor ring will also be commutative.

Observe that there is a canonical ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\pi : R \rightarrow R / I&lt;/math&gt; determined by &lt;math&gt;\pi(r) = r+I&lt;/math&gt;, called the projection map. We record some properties of this homomorphism in the next section of the isomorphism theorems.

== Ring Isomorphism Theorems ==

We have already proved the isomorphism theorems for groups. Now we can use analogous arguments to prove the isomorphism theorems for rings, substitution the notion of &quot;normal subgroups&quot; with ideals.

=== Factor Theorem ===

Let I be an ideal of a ring R, Let &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)=x+I&lt;/math&gt; be the usual homomorphism from R to R/I. Now let f be a homomorphism from R to S. Observe that if &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi} : R/I \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is a ring homomorphism, then the composition &lt;math&gt;\phi = \tilde{\phi} \circ \pi : R \rightarrow R/I \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; is a ring homomorphism such that &lt;math&gt;I \subset \ker{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;x \in I \Rightarrow \phi(x) = \tilde{\phi} \circ \pi(x) = \tilde{\phi}(0_{R/I}) = 0_S&lt;/math&gt;). This characterizes all such morphisms in the following sense

'''Factor Theorem:'''
Let &lt;math&gt;\phi : R \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; be a ring homomorphism such that &lt;math&gt;I \subset \ker{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a unique homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi} : R /I \rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi = \tilde{\phi} \circ \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism if and only if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is a monomorphism if and only if its kernel is I.

''Proof'' We prove it the same way we did for groups. Define &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}(x+I)&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;. To see that this is well-defined, let a+I=b+I, and so that a-b is an element of I, so that &lt;math&gt;\phi(a-b)=0_S&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\phi(a)=\phi(b)&lt;/math&gt;. Now &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism, implying that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is also. The proofs of the additional statements can be carried over from the proofs of the additional statements of the factor theorem from groups.

=== First Isomorphism Theorem ===
Let R be a ring, and let f be a homomorphism from R to S with kernel K. Then the image of f is isomorphic to R/K.

''Proof''&lt;br /&gt;
Using the factor theorem, we can find a homomorphism from R/K to S, and since the kernel is the same as the ideal used in forming the quotient group, and since the f is an epimorphism over its image, this homomorphism is an isomorphism.

=== Second Isomorphism Theorem ===
Let R be a ring, let I be an ideal, and let S be a subring.
#S+I, the set of all s+i with s within S and i within I, is a subring of R.
#I is an ideal of S+I.
#The intersection of S and I is an ideal of S.
#(S+I)/I is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;S/(S\cap I)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof''
#It can be verified that it contains 1, and is closed under multiplication.
#Of course, since I is an ideal of R, then it must be an ideal under any subring.
#From a similar argument for groups, it can only contain elements of I, but restricted to S, so it must be an ideal of S.
#Let &lt;math&gt;f: R \rightarrow R/I&lt;/math&gt; be a function restricted to the domain S, and define &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+I&lt;/math&gt;. It is obvious that its kernel is &lt;math&gt;S\cap I&lt;/math&gt; and that its image is (S+I)/I.

=== Third Isomorphism Theorem ===
Let I be an ideal of a ring R, and let J be an ideal of the same ring R that contains I. J/I is an ideal of R/I, and R/J is isomorphic to (R/I)/(J/I).

''Proof''
Define the function &lt;math&gt;f: R/I \rightarrow R/J&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;f(a+I)=a+J&lt;/math&gt; which is well-defined because since I is an ideal that is within J. This is also obviously a homomorphism. Its kernel is all elements that map onto J, and is thus all a+I such that a is within J, or J/I. Moreover, its image is R/J, and so we can use the first isomorphism theorem to prove the result.

=== Correspondence Theorem ===
Let I be an ideal of a ring R. Define the function &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to map the set of rings and ideals containing I to the set of rings and ideals of R/I, where &lt;math&gt;\pi (X)&lt;/math&gt; = the set of all cosets x+I where x is an element of X. This function is one-to-one, and the image of rings or ideals containing I are rings or ideals within R/I.

''Proof''
Define the function f from rings or ideals containing I to the rings or ideals of R/I, by f(A)=A/I. We have already proved the correspondence for addition because rings form an abelian group under addition. Thus, we need only to check for multiplication. Suppose S is a subring of R containing I. S/I is obviously closed under addition and subtraction. For multiplication, suppose that x and y are elements of S. Then (x+I)(y+I)=xy+I which is also an element of S/I, proving that it is closed under multiplication. The identity 1 is within S, and we have it that 1+I is also within S/I. Thus, S/I is a subring of R/I. Now suppose that S/I is a subring of R/I. Then it is also obvious that S is closed under addition and subtraction and multiplication, proving that S is a subring of R. Now suppose that J is an ideal of R containing I. Then by the third isomorphism theorem, J/I is an ideal of R/I. Now suppose that J/I is an ideal of R/I. Let r be any element of R, and let j be any element of J. Then since J/I is an ideal of R/I, (r+I)(j+I)=rj+I must be an element of J/I. This indicates that rj must be an element of J, proving that J is an ideal of R.

==Chinese Remainder Theorem==
=== Definitions ===
'''Definition:'''
Two elements &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; are said to be ''congruent'' in an ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; if and only if they belong to the same coset in R/I. This is true when a-b is within I. Write &lt;math&gt;a = b \bmod{I}&lt;/math&gt; to mean that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is congruent to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Lemma:'''
Given an ideal &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq R&lt;/math&gt;, a subset of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the congruence class &lt;math&gt;[r]&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of an element &lt;math&gt;r \in R&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;[0]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;r \in I&lt;/math&gt;.  To see this, simply note that &lt;math&gt;a = b \bmod{I}&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;a-b\in I&lt;/math&gt;; plugging in gives &lt;math&gt;r-0\in I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition:'''
Two natural numbers are relatively prime when ax+by=1 for integers x and y. We do the same for rings - two ideals I and J are relatively prime when ai+bj=1 for ring elements a, b, and for an element i within I and an element j within J. In other words, two ideals are relatively prime if their sum contains the identity element i. e. if I+J is the whole ring R.

We will now prove the

=== Chinese Remainder Theorem ===

Let R be a ring, and let &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; be n pairwise (i. e. when considering any two pairs) relatively prime ideals.
#Let a be a number from 1 to n. There exists an element r within R that is within all ideals &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;n \neq a&lt;/math&gt;, and such that &lt;math&gt;r = 1 \bmod{I_a}&lt;/math&gt;
#Let &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2, ..., r_n&lt;/math&gt; be elements of R. Then there exists an element r within R such that &lt;math&gt;r = r_i \bmod{I_i}&lt;/math&gt; for all i=1,2,3,...,n.
#Let I be the intersection of the ideals. Another element of R, s satisfies &lt;math&gt;s = r_i \bmod{I_i}&lt;/math&gt; for all i=1,2,3,...,n if and only if &lt;math&gt;r=s \bmod{I}&lt;/math&gt;.
#R/I is isomorphic to the product ring &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i=1}^n R/I_i&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof''
#Since &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_i&lt;/math&gt; (i&gt;1) are relatively prime, there will exist an elements &lt;math&gt;b_i\in I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_i\in I_i&lt;/math&gt; (i&gt;1) such that &lt;math&gt;b_i+c_i=1&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i=2}^n (b_i+c_i)=1&lt;/math&gt;. Now we expand this product on the left side. All terms of the product other than &lt;math&gt;c_2c_3c_4...c_n&lt;/math&gt; belong to &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;c_2c_3c_4...c_n&lt;/math&gt; itself belongs the set S of all finite sums of products &lt;math&gt;x_2x_3x_4...x_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;x_i\in I_i&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, it can be written in the form b+a=1, where b is an element of &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;, and where a is an element of S. Then &lt;math&gt;a\equiv 1 \pmod{I_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a\equiv 0 \pmod{I_i}&lt;/math&gt; for i&gt;1.

== Prime and Maximal Ideals ==

There are two important classes of ideals in a ring - ''Prime'' and ''Maximal''.

'''Definition''':
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''prime'' if it satisfies:

for any ideals A and B such that AB is a subset of I , implies A is in I or B is in I. 

'''Definition''':
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''maximal'' if it is proper (i.e. &lt;math&gt;I \subsetneq R&lt;/math&gt; and it satisfies:

&lt;math&gt;I \subset J \triangleleft R \implies I = J \text{ or } J = R&lt;/math&gt;

That is, there are no proper ideals between &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

The following Lemma is important for many results, and it makes essential use of Zorn's Lemma (or equivalently the Axiom of Choice)

'''Lemma''':
Every non-invertible element of a ring is contained in some maximal ideal

'''Proof''':
Suppose &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the non-invertible element. Then the first observation is that &lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a proper ideal, for if &lt;math&gt;(x) = R&lt;/math&gt;, then in particular &lt;math&gt;1 \in (x)&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;1 = ax&lt;/math&gt; contradiction the assumption. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; be the set of proper ideals in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ordered by inclusion. The first observation implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, so to apply Zorn's Lemma we need only show that every increasing set of ideals contains an upper-bound. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\{ I_j \}_j&lt;/math&gt; is such an increasing set, then the least upper bound is &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in j} I_j&lt;/math&gt; as this is the smallest ideal containing each ideal. If one checks that the union &lt;math&gt;\cup_{j \in J} I_j&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal, then this must be &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J} I_j&lt;/math&gt;. To show it's proper, we need only show &lt;math&gt;1 \notin \cup_{j \in J} I_j&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. But this follows precisely because each &lt;math&gt;I_j&lt;/math&gt; is proper.

Therefore by Zorn's Lemma there is a maximal element &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. It is clearly maximal for if &lt;math&gt;J'&lt;/math&gt; were any ideal satisfying &lt;math&gt;J \subset J^\prime \subsetneq R&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;J^\prime&lt;/math&gt; would be an element of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, and by maximality of &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; we would have &lt;math&gt;J^\prime \subset J&lt;/math&gt; whence &lt;math&gt;J = J^\prime&lt;/math&gt;.

Properties of rings may be naturally restated in terms of the ideal structure. For instance

'''Proposition''':
A commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is an Integral Domain if and only if &lt;math&gt;(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a prime ideal.

'''Proof''': This follows simply because &lt;math&gt;x = 0 \iff x \in (0)&lt;/math&gt;.

This explains why an Integral Domain is also referred to as a ''Prime Ring''. Similarly, we may give a necessary and sufficient condition for a ring to be a field :

'''Proposition''':
A commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a ''Field'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal (that is there are no proper ideals)

'''Proof''': We only need to show that every element &lt;math&gt;0 \neq x \in R&lt;/math&gt; is invertible. Suppose not then by Lemma ... &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is contained in some (proper) maximal ideal, a contradiction.

'''Corollary''':
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''maximal'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;R / I&lt;/math&gt; is a field.

'''Proof''': By the previous Proposition we know &lt;math&gt;R / I&lt;/math&gt; is a field if and only if its only proper ideal is &lt;math&gt;(0)&lt;/math&gt;. By the correspondence theorem (...) this happens if and only if there are no proper ideals containing &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Corollary''':
The kernel of a homomorphism f from R to S is a maximal ideal when S is a field. The proof of this follows from the first isomorphism theorem because S is isomorphic to R/ker f.

It's also clear that

'''Lemma''':
An ideal &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is ''prime'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;R / I&lt;/math&gt; is an integral domain.

'''Proof''': Write &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; for the element of &lt;math&gt;R / I&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the equivalence class &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly every element of &lt;math&gt;R / I&lt;/math&gt; can be written in this form.

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\bar{xy} = 0 \iff xy \in I \iff x \in I \text{ or } y \in I \iff \bar{x} = 0 \text{ or } \bar{y} = 0&lt;/math&gt; where the second equivalence follows directly because &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is prime.

&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow)&lt;/math&gt; This follows in exactly the same way.

'''Corollary''':
The kernel of a homomorphism f from R to S is a prime ideal when S is an integral domain. The proof of this follows from the first isomorphism theorem because S is isomorphic to R/ker f.

'''Lemma''':
A maximal ideal is also prime.

'''Proof''':
Suppose &lt;math&gt;I \triangleleft R&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal ideal, and &lt;math&gt;xy \in I&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose further that &lt;math&gt;x \notin I&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ideal &lt;math&gt;I + (x)&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal containing &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, so is strictly larger than &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. By maximality &lt;math&gt;I + (x) = R \ni 1&lt;/math&gt;. So &lt;math&gt;1 = i + rx \implies y = iy + rxy \in I&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Alternatively, we can use the above two results, and the fact that all fields are integral domains to prove this.

'''Telecine''' (otherwise known as &quot;TK&quot;) is the process of transferring motion picture film to a video format, such as television, or a machine used to complete this process.  Telecine enables a motion picture, captured originally on film, to be viewed with standard video equipment, such as televisions and video cassette decks. This has allowed producers and distributors working in film to release their products on video and allowed producers to use video production equipment to complete their film projects.

==Basic principle==
In a simple telecine, white light is shone through exposed and developed motion picture negative (positives can also be used.)  As in a projector, the film filters the white light into different colors, according to the image on the film, except in a telecine this image is projected not onto a screen, but onto a charge-coupled device (CCD) or vidicon tube.  The CCD converts the light into electrical impulses which the telecine electronics modulate into a video signal which can then be recorded onto video tape, or broadcast.

The most complex part of telecine is the synchronization of the mechanical film motion and the electronic video signal.  Every time the video part of the telecine samples the light electronically, the film part of the telecine must have a frame in perfect registration and ready to photograph.  This is relatively easy when the film is photographed at the same frame rate as the video camera will sample, but when this is not true, a sophisticated procedure is required to change frame rate.

==Frame rate differences==
In countries that use the PAL or SECAM video standards, film destined for television is photographed at 25 frames per second. The PAL video standard broadcasts at 25 frames per second, so the transfer from film to video is simple; for every film frame, one video frame is captured. Theatrical features originally photographed at 24 frames per second are simply sped up by 4% to 25 frames per second. This can cause a noticeable increase in audio pitch, which is sometimes corrected using a pitch shifter.  (Note: '''frames per second'' is sometimes refered to as '''frame/s''' or '''fps'''.)

In the United States and other countries that use the NTSC television standard, film is generally photographed at 24 frames per second. (Only programs aimed directly for television in the USA are shot at 23.976 fps.)  Color NTSC video is broadcast at 29.97 frame/s.  For the film's motion to be accurately rendered on the video signal, an NTSC telecine must use a technique called the 3:2 pulldown to convert from 24 to 29.97 frame/s.

Similar techniques must be used for films shot at &quot;silent speeds&quot; of less than 24 frame/s, which include most silent movies themselves as well as many home movies.

Some High Definition video recorders can record directly to 24fps (23.976fps) or 25fps so no interlacing is required. You can find out more at High-Definition Telecine.

==3:2 Pulldown==
The 3:2 pulldown is accomplished in two steps.  The first step is to slow down, or &quot;pulldown&quot; the film motion by 0.1%.  This speed change is unnoticeable to the viewer, and makes the film travel at 23.976 frame/s.  (This is done simply by slowing the projector.)

The second step of the 3:2 pulldown is the 3:2 step (which adds the extra frames needed for the conversion.)  At 23.976 frame/s, there are 4 frames of film for every 5 frames of NTSC video:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{23.976}{29.97} = \frac{4}{5}&lt;/math&gt;

These four frames are &quot;stretched&quot; into five by exploiting the interlaced nature of NTSC video.  For every NTSC frame, there are actually two complete images or &quot;fields,&quot; one for the odd-numbered lines of the image, and one for the even-numbered lines.  There are, therefore, ten fields for every 4 film frames, and the telecine alternately places one film frame across two fields, the next across three, the next across two, and so on.  The cycle repeats itself completely after four film frames have been exposed, and in the telecine cycle these are called the &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B,&quot; &quot;C,&quot; and &quot;D&quot; frames, thus:

:[[image:Three-two_pulldown_diagram_%28telecine%29.png|Three-two pulldown diagram telecine.png]]

Note that the pattern in this example is actually 2-3, 2-3.  The name &quot;3:2 pulldown&quot; is an archaic reference to the pattern that was used by older telecine equipment.  The modern telecine uses a 2-3 technique.

&quot;3:2 pulldown&quot; creates error in the video signal that can be clearly seen in the above image.  This is one reason why NTSC films viewed at home rarely appear as smooth as when viewed in a cinema.  Some line doublers and most software DVD players are designed to detect and reverse 3:2 pulldown, thereby recreating the original frames.

==One light, best light and scene to scene==

The color of the frame can be controlled during the telecine process.  This section needs to be expanded to explain one light, best light, and other terms used in the telecine process which effect the coloring of the frames and the consistency of the color from scene to scene.

Briefly, a one light transfer means that footage is transferred with no regard to variations in exposure on the original negative i.e, the telecine is set at one value to transfer all of the footage. This is the standard first step when transferring rushes to tape, it's quicker, since it requires no intervention on behalf of the telecine operator, and is therefore cheaper. Best light means that footage is graded to look it's best in every take and scene, matching original lighting conditions and the desires of the Director and DOP. Finally, scene-by-scene tries to match the light and coloring of each scene, usually after picture editing is complete. All of the above can be done with either traditional methods (photochemically etc) or digitally.

==History of Telecine==

Before the invention of video tape, telecine was used only to convert motion pictures for immediate '''broadcast''' via television.

After the invention of video tape which can be used to store motion pictures, the telecine process was also used to convert motion pictures to video tapes or LaserDiscs for '''distribution'''. 

By 1987, '''computer editing systems''' such as the '''CMX6000''' became available to edit motion pictures.  Somehow, the '''film dailies''' from a motion picture (or a television drama that was shot on film) had to be converted to a format that can be used by computer editing systems.  In the case of the CMX6000, this computer editing systems controlled the playback of LaserDiscs containing the film dailies.   To get the film dailies onto Laser Disc, the film dailies had to be telecined.  The CMX6000, EditDroid, Ediflex or Montage did '''not''' actual store the images in the computer.

A few years later, after digital video formats for computers (such as QuickTime) were invented, there needed to be a way to transfer all the frames of the film dailies onto hard disk drives of computer editing systems so the images and sound for a motion picture or television drama can be edited '''inside''' the computer, not externally as with the CMX6000, EditDroid, Ediflex or Montage.  The only practical option was to telecine the film dailies to video tape (which is a cheap storage media) before digitizing each of the frames of the video into data files for the computer editing systems.

Only in the last few years, can you telecine dailies directly to computer disks (rather than video tape.)  Be aware that most post-production houses today still cannot telecine to hard disk drives so ask before you decide which film lab you will use to develop and telecine your dailies.

;Telecine Dailies - For Theatrical Release
:When movies are edited in a computer editing systems, the film negative for the motion picture must still be cut so the movie can be projected on film in theaters.  Therefore, the computer editing systems must work at exactly 24.00 frames per second, not 29.97 (in the case of NTSC video) or 25 frames per second (in the case of PAL video).  Unfortunately, there is no video format which works at exactly 24.00 frames per second.  This causes no end of problems. (Note: Cutting the negative is called &quot;Conforming the Negative&quot; so that it conforms to the edit done on the computer editing systems.)

;Telecine Dailies - Direct to Video Tape
:Even if a motion picture will be edited on video and release on DVD-Video disk, it must edited at approximately 24 frames per second, not 29.97 frames per second.  '''All motion picture shot on film and released on NTSC DVD-Video disk in Hollywood are stored on the DVD-Video disk at '''23.976''' frames per second.  Motion pictures on NTSC DVD-Video disk are never stored 29.97 frames per second.'''  This is probably the most common misconception of beginning filmmakers.  The reason is motion pictures stored at 24 frames per second can be much higher resolution than motion pictures shot on video at 29.97 frames per second since a motion picture at 24 frames per second contains fewer frames that must be compressed into the very limited bandwidth of a DVD-Video disk.  (Actually, this is not a great problem '''until''' you add multiple audio track which also have to fit in the limited bandwidth of a DVD data stream.)

===Telecine for Dailies===

Today, video tape remains the cheapest and (ugh!) the most convenient method of storing dailies which have been telecined.  Therefore, film editors have two choices when working with film dailies:

;1.  Do an Inverse Telecine
:One option is to '''telecine''' to video, then digitize all the frames, but finally do an '''inverse telecine''' to throw away the unwanted fields and frames so that your disk drive only holds actual film frames.  In this case, there is a one-to-one relationship with the original film negative.  This is a very clean solution... but most computer editing systems do not work this way.

;2.  Software Solution (such as CineTools)
:The other option is to '''telecine''' to video and then digitize all the frames (even the duplicate frames created during the telecine process) for storage on a hard drive. Then use a computer program to keep track of '''bad''' frames while you edit the motion picture so you only see the good frames and you never edit on a bad frame.  This is wasteful and confusing but because video tapes are so cheap and disk drives are so expensive, most everyone uses this method.

===NTSC Inverse Telecine===

The '''inverse telecine''' process is the opposite of the telecine process (at least in theory).  Inverse telecine is the process of taking '''video''' at 29.97 frames per second (59.94 fields per second) and converting them back to exactly 24.00 frames per second.  In practice, most computer software will inverse telecine NTSC video back to 23.976 frames per second Computer programs such as Media Cleaner and Adobe AfterEffects have an '''inverse telecine''' feature.  Actually, these programs only do half the job (remove the 3/2 pull down) and ignore the rest (specifically correcting the audio speed)... which most of the time is acceptable.

To repeat what is said above, telecine is really a two step process:

:1.  Slow down the projection of the film from 24.00 to 23.976 (24.00*1000/1001) frames per second.

:2.  Add extra fields and frames to convert 23.976 frames per second to 29.97 (30.00*1000/1001) frames per second for NTSC video.

====Practical Example====
Computer programs such as Media Cleaner and Adobe AfterEffects only reverse step 2, not step 1.  In some cases, this does not matter.  Here is an example:

;Wrong but Easy
:The [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop] creates editing workshops from dramatic scenes shot on 35mm film for film students to edit with Final Cut Pro at 24 frames per second on a Macintosh computer.   After the dailies have been telecined, the dailies are delivered on either NTSC video tape or NTSC DVD-Video disks.  First, Adobe AfterEffects is used to '''inverse telecine''' the footage from 29.97 frames per second (interlaced) to 23.976 frames per second (progressive). Then QuickTime Movie Player is used to '''compress''' the movie clips at 24.00 frames per second which means that occasionally (every 1000 frames), the program duplicates one frame to keep the audio in sync with the picture.

:Hopefully, you notice that this is '''not''' the correct way to do an inverse telecine.  Using this method, any edit created using these dailies can '''never''' be matched back to the original negative.  Because of the occasional duplicate frame, the frame numbers will be '''wrong'''.  But for training film students, this is good enough.

:To do this correctly, the Star Movie Shop should change the speed of the audio from 23.976 frames per second to 24.000 frames per second as well as change the projection speed of the QuickTime movie clips from 23.976 to 24.000.  Correcting the audio is not easy... so they don't.  They just add duplicate frames instead.  (Note:  No one has ever complained!!!)



== Amateur telecine of Super 8mm footage: ==


Here is a free way to telecine your Super 8mm footage for personal use. The method can also applied to other film gauges with the relevant equipment. It is based on the initial telecine method of shooting the projection screen. However, attention must be given to obtain good results. If you think that you just point and shoot, forget it! The result will be very disappointing. You have to do exactly as described, mainly calibrate the video camera correctly and eliminate flicker.

'''History:'''

My father has a moderate collection of Super 8mm movies, either bought (mostly cartoons and B&amp;W comedies) or shot back in the 80's with an amateur Canon Super 8mm sound camera. In the late 70's, early 80's when me and my sister were little, video was rare and expensive, at least in Greece, so our only source of entertainment was a black and white TV or cartoons on Super 8mm films. My father had bought quite a lot of these and made a good collection of Disney and Warner Bros classics. He had even spliced some of these in longer reels to keep us busy for more time. Of course he shot amateur films in every occasion (mostly at 18fps, which was similar to the LP mode in video-cameras), much like we shoot video today. Back in 1993, I decided to transfer all these memories to video for easier watching and sharing with friends. When I asked at our local photo lab I was astonished to hear a rather high price per 50ft reel (about 30€ which back in 1993 was much more valuable than today in 2006), and this was simply transferring the movies to a humble VHS tape, not any correction included, (and of course DV tapes and DVD didn't exist back in 1993)! Meanwhile, I had bought my Sony Handycam TR-805E Hi-8 camera that year which was the best (EISA Award for best camcorder 1992-1993), according to a popular Greek magazine called Hitech. Yes it had many features first seen in this particular model like optical steady shot, 400 lines resolution, manual controls etc. So I quickly decided to telecine the films myself, for free, using that camera. Of course I hadn't done it before, so first results were not satisfactory. But a tape can be re-recorded, so I tried again and again until I mastered the technique. So fellow amateurs don't worry! If you do EXACTLY what I describe below you will get good results, even with the first time!


'''Equipment:'''

1) Super 8mm (or whatever) film projector with variable projection speed.

2) Video-camera with manual exposure, focus, color balance and external mic in socket. Preferably a PAL version at 25fps which makes eliminating flicker easier (see below).

3) A good quality matte A4 white sheet of paper used as screen. Thick paper is better as it is easier to stretch it to keep it smooth.

4) Tripod to mount the camera.

5) A color monitor, preferably without overscan (so avoid a TV, use PC monitor if possible).

6) Headphones and other appropriate connection cables and adapters.


You could clean and lubricate your film if desired, and then you are ready to proceed...


'''Setup of the system:'''

The white A4 sheet of paper should be stuck on a wall. To avoid adhesive tape showing on the video you should use tape that sticks on both sides and put it at the back side of the paper. I use regular tape but create a little loop so it sticks both sides, and I place it at the back of each corner of the A4 paper. Thick paper is better. When you stick the paper make sure it is stretched and looks straight. If you have a smooth matte white wall you could use that instead. Avoid projection screens as they are not white and they are not smooth. Place the projector directly in front of the A4 paper or white wall. Make sure it is as centered to the screen as possible and doesn't project from an angle, either horizontal or vertical as this will give a distorted trapezoidal image! Mount your video-camera on the tripod and make sure it frames the A4 paper as centered as possible, again avoid any large angles which will distort the image. If your projector has sound editing capabilities, it should have a audio monitor output or external speakers output. Connect that with the camera's external microphone socket, using appropriate adapters if required. Don't load tape or disc to the camera yet. Most consumer cameras will switch off if not recording for several seconds. To avoid that simply don't load the tape/disc so it will stay on as long as it takes for you to calibrate your setup (see below). Connect the TV or computer monitor (via video or TV card) to assist framing etc. Connect headphones to the camera to assist sound setup (see below). Needless to say that the video-camera should be mains-powered to avoid switching off during the process! Don't load the projector with film yet...

'''Finding and locking the white balance:'''

Without film in the projector, project to the A4 paper. Use the zoom function (if applicable) to make the projected image as small as possible. This will help enhancing the video dynamic range (since the image will be as bright as it gets, we will set the exposure so as not to washout highlights and leave the camera cover darker tones as good as it can, see below). Adjust the projector if necessary so the white rectangle is projected at the center of the A4 paper. Frame the white rectangle with the camera, and zoom in enough to make sure that all the camera's sensor is filled with white. You may also deliberately blur the image a little (using the camera's focus control) to make white appear more uniform. Leave the camera to obtain the white balance automatically. After several seconds which ensure the camera has made up its mind on the white point, HOLD it using the appropriate control. This will ensure it is not affected by the scene lighting or color variations during recording. For cameras that allow manual white balance in small steps you could fine-tune it but rely on a good calibrated monitor for this, avoid the viewfinder or the camera monitor! I would suggest not to touch the white balance once locked. At this point bear in mind that some films (e.g., Disney cartoons) are color balanced for a Super 8mm projector's yellow light so they might appear a bit blue if balanced as above, but I personally don't mind as this can be fixed digitally later. If you are using a PC monitor, make sure it is well calibrated so your movie color and brightness appears correctly. Most monitors allow a &quot;user color&quot; setting. If you use that and set all three primary colors to the same value (e.g., 80% or 100%) you will almost always have correct white balance. The application used to watch the video image should have its color settings reset to default. Any errors can be corrected during editing later. I once had changed the color settings in the video application for another capture and I forgot to reset these to default, so the film image appeared bluer. When I tried to &quot;correct&quot; this altering the white balance from the camera, I resulted with yellowish video! So don't touch ANY controls once adjusted, especially from the camera! For B&amp;W films you could enable the B&amp;W or sepia effect (for cameras that support it), but I would rather record it as &quot;color&quot; to have a more realistic look (B&amp;W effect would make it look more like B&amp;W TV broadcast, rather than B&amp;W film). So we have white balance fixed, let's proceed with...

'''Adjusting the focus:'''

At this point you have to load a short film in the projector. If you are quick enough you can do all of the rest calibrations before it runs out. While projecting on the A4 sheet, focus the projector as sharp as possible. Then zoom out and frame roughly the camera so it sees all the image and manually focus it. Leave focus to manual so it is not affected with scene changes. Using the monitor frame the camera as good as possible so you don't crop the projected image, but not let any annoying black areas either. If the aspect ratio doesn't match, then make sure you don't crop the horizontal dimension while centering the vertical dimension. Focus again if necessary. Bear in mind that if you change reels you may have to fine-tune focus of the projector. Also focus may be lost between spliced sections, if the splicing is not very good. If you use a computer monitor to avoid overscan, I suggest watching the video in a window so to assist perfect framing. If you only have a TV monitor you could zoom in by one or two steps to make sure there are no black areas around the projected image.

'''Adjusting the exposure:'''

While watching the image, manually adjust the camera exposure so it doesn't wash out light areas (highlights) and let camera cover darker areas as best as it can. This is because it is preferable to lose some information of the dark areas (which might not be that obvious) than wash out light areas which will be very annoying. Hopefully newer digital cameras will have greater dynamic range than my old analog Hi-8 had and should give better results. Let exposure to manual so it is not affected with lighting and scene changes. Hopefully the lighting will be the same for most of the movie, but in some amateur films there are differences notably between outdoor and indoor scenes. Don't worry some of it can be corrected digitally. Don't touch the exposure! Again, if you are using a PC monitor make sure is well calibrated for our dark working environment (brightness and contrast) and that the video application's color/brightness/contrast settings are reset to default. Due to gamma difference between TV/video and a PC monitor the image might appear a bit darker. This is normal, adjust the exposure as described above and don't worry. The same video played back on a TV monitor should look normal since it will have the correct gamma value.

'''The trickiest part, eliminating flicker:'''

To eliminate flicker, we have to match the projection frame rate with the camera frame rate. For PAL cameras this is relatively easy. We adjust the projection speed to 25fps for 24fps footage or to 16.66fps (50/3) for 18fps footage using a variable speed projector. Audio pitch difference is negligible and should not concern an amateur. A different approach is to adjust the shutter speed in cameras that support it. Mine doesn't so I cannot tell how good that works. I can tell that I was able to almost eliminate flicker by carefully adjusting the projection speed as described above. For NTSC users you could project at 20fps (60/3) for both 24fps or 18fps footage but the audio pitch difference might be very annoying, and not all variable speed projectors support that large variation of ±2 or ±4fps (my Chinon 9600 only supports ±1.5fps for example). I only have a PAL camera model, so I cannot tell how bad audio pitch difference sounds at 20fps. Later you could speed up or slow down the movie as appropriate to restore audio pitch, using a video editing software which supports this feature (eg Adobe Premiere). Of course you should rely on your monitor to eliminate flicker, not the camera viewfinder or built-in monitor! A CRT monitor is preferable since LCD monitors tend to hide flicker if it is small. Of course make sure the refresh rate (for CRT PC monitors) is set to highest possible for the used resolution, so as not to mistake monitor's flicker as film's flicker. Color depth should also be at least 16-bit or higher to assist color balance. Have in mind that when changing reels you may need to readjust the projection speed to eliminate flicker again. Also I am not sure if enabling the steady shot feature will help, but I do it anyway just to be on the safe side. Besides, since the video-camera is mains-powered we shouldn't worry about the higher power consumption. For new digital cameras that support it, you could try the 24fps setting (for 24fps films only), provided the image aspect ratio is not affected (in some models setting 24fps capture may also set 16:9 mode). Also enabling progressive mode (if supported) will improve image quality, regardless of the frame rate setting. Unfortunatelly my old analog Hi-8 camera doesn't support either of the two, so I don't know how much they help.

'''Adjusting the audio recording level for sound films:'''

It is recommended to use headphones for this as with speakers you may not notice much of the noise. Since we will be using the camera's external microphone input, it is usually boosted to improve reception, or in our case to distort sound! Using the headphones lower the volume a lot until you don't hear any distortion or the distortion is as small as it gets. Make sure the sound is heard as clear as it gets albeit if you cannot remove noise 100%. Usually a small noise is not audible in normal listening conditions through the TV loudspeakers. It only becomes audible in a very quiet environment or using headphones, so an amateur should not worry too much. Some video editing applications can also clean noisy soundtracks in some degree, if necessary, but again I wouldn't bother if noise is not audible in normal listening conditions.

'''What about my silent films?'''

If you have silent films I suggest that you set the projector to &quot;silent&quot; mode (if applicable) and switch off the internal camera microphone. Many will rush to say this is not possible with consumer cameras. Don't worry, here is a trick I have used: Connect a cable in the external microphone input but leave the other end unconnected. This will switch off the internal microphone in order to use the &quot;external&quot; one supposedly connected to the external microphone input. Always use your headphones to confirm no sound is recorded as a bad connection could record electronic noise and spoil the movie (unless you are willing to mute your TV set when watching your silent films). Don't forget to switch back to &quot;Magnetic&quot; or &quot;Optical&quot; mode for your sound films!

'''Ready to telecine your films?'''

Rewind the short reel you used to calibrate your setup. Load carefully the projector with the actual film you want to telecine, making sure you don't move the projector! Load carefully the tape or disc in the camera without moving it. If there is a remote control for the camera, it is a good idea to use it to avoid any accidental movement. Set the projection switch to THREAD (or similar) position and make sure the film leader is properly wound on the take up reel, even if it supposed to do that automatically, to avoid damage while projection. Do not thread it too much however, but keep it as far from the beginning of the movie as possible, so you won't miss the start! Switch off the projector. Turn off all lights to make sure stray light doesn't affect the projected image so the colors will look as vivid as it's possible (stray light reduces saturation and makes old films look even fader). If it is daytime darken the room as best as you can and use only a very small light (about 2 or 4 watts) away from the projection screen. It is recommended that all calibration is done in these final dark conditions for best results. When ready start projecting immediately and then start recording as fast as you can. If you don't mind leaving some blank seconds on the tape, you could start recording first, to make sure you won't miss the film start if the film leader is too short and the movie is almost starting. Fine-tune the focus of the projector carefully, if required, avoiding to blur the image. If you are familiar with your projector you should be able to know which way to turn the focus knob to avoid blurring the image accidentally. Wear your headphones for a few seconds, make sure sound is recorded as expected (I have had some bad experiences), or no sound is recorded at all for silent movies. When finished with one reel, rewind and change reels carefully without moving the projector. Refocus the new reel if required. Never leave the projector unattended as the picture may jump and you have to press the relevant release button briefly. If you fail to do so, the rest of your movie will be jumping and useless and you may damage the sprocket holes of the rest of the film. Don't even think about fixing a jumping movie digitally. It is virtually impossible. It is better to telecine that again. Other problem that I have seen is that the framing of the projector is lost and the upper or lower area of the picture shows the adjacent frame. This usually happens between spliced sections (not perfect splices) and can be corrected with the relevant knob which moves the projection gate vertically. Once familiar with the projector you should know which way to turn it to correct rather than pronounce the error. Usually the overscan feature of a TV will hide a small framing error, but I personally prefer to be as perfect as I can.

'''Digitizing tips:'''

*  If you want to digitally edit your video, of course you must first import it in a computer. When using a digital camera, video is already in digital form and is transferred as is to a computer (provided you use a DV cable, not analog cables!) or converted to other digital format (eg MPEG 2 for DVD authoring). So with the right software you can edit your footage in some degree. Remember that if the recording is not good enough you cannot do wonders, at least not with consumer level software.
*  If you are using an analog camera (or a digital connected with analog cables for some reason), make sure film flicker is totally eliminated or as small as it gets. This is because when digitizing the video using consumer level cards (such as TV tuner cards) the flicker will most likely be pronounced. I have seen some of my early telecine attempts that they have only negligible and hardly visible flicker when watched on a TV, but too much when the same footage is digitized. This usually appears like the picture is perfectly exposed for a moment and then overexposed and washed out. This cycle repeats about every half second or faster while watching and it is very annoying. No matter what settings I chose to digitize that footage, I could not avoid this annoying effect. Thankfully newer TV tuner cards do not suffer that much as my old Matrox Rainbow Runner I used back in the 90's but the problem still exists! And don't forget that the best analog connection (that cameras support) is S-Video, so prefer that over the simpler composite output. Also if you use the dual RCA audio outputs, you should get better quality than the headphones output.
*  Also for best results I recommend to capture the video (analog source) or convert it during transfer from the camera (digital source, DV connection) using the desired final resolution, such as 720x576 for DVD or 352x288 for Video-CD. Using larger resolution and then resizing could give better results but it takes more hard disk space and rendering time. If you don't want to make any corrections other than cut and merge, using the final desired resolution will make rendering times much shorter as scaling is time and resource consuming. Also make sure you capture (or convert for DV cameras) directly to the final desired format such as MPEG 2 for DVD, if your capture card/software allows. Of course you should capture at 25fps for PAL or 29.97fps for NTSC, to match the camera rate, NOT 24fps (unless video was shot at 24fps) or you will negate any flickering elimination efforts made!
*  If you first capture to AVI or MOV/QT for MAC computers (usually M-JPEG compressed) and then convert to MPEG (as with older capture cards that didn't support MPEG capturing), will make editing easier (most programs work with AVI/MOV/QT rather than MPEG files) but will make rendering time larger (conversion between formats is time consuming). Also if you compress the video in one format (eg M-JPEG for AVI/MOV/QT capture) and then convert to another, the video is re-encoded, even for simple cut and merge functions, and quality degrades. This is also true for scaling, so use final specifications (format, resolution, color depth etc) directly. There are several programs to edit MPEG video, such as Pinnacle Studio and some freeware too (eg TMPGEnc, search on the internet with keywords such as &quot;MPEG editing&quot;).
*  During editing keep changes confined to the scene concerned (unless most of your film needs correction) to shorten rendering times and keep degradation from re-encoding to the minimum. A clever trick is to cut out the parts that need corrections or effects or titles, edit them separately and then merge them with the rest of the movie using references to the original video file for the unedited parts. If you do all of this keeping the SAME specifications, most programs will merge all the footage WITHOUT re-encoding (recompressing) the unedited parts, so there will be no degradation at all in the unedited parts (since basically their data will be copied directly from the original video file, rather than being processed)! This also saves much time since copying a digital file is much faster than creating it form start. (Processor only takes notice when starting to copy rather than being involved the whole time, whereas when creating the file all job is supervised by the processor).
*  If you want to make a DIVX video or similar MPEG 4 format, avoid capturing directly to MPEG 4 format, since MPEG 4 compression on the fly is very CPU and memory demanding and you will most likely get a lot of compression artifacts. It is best to capture to high quality M-JPEG compression (AVI/MOV/QT) or MPEG 2 format and convert to DIVX later. When you have finished editing your film in the original format, render it as a video file of the original capture format using the same specifications to minimize compression artifacts, as explained above. Then convert the final rendered file to DIVX or similar MPEG 4 format using as large bitrate as you can (provided the final video fits on a CD if you want to save it on CD) and of course select the best possible quality setting (this in DIVX PRO 5 and above is called &quot;insane quality&quot;). Conversion utilities include QuickTime Pro (for MOV/QT files), VirtualDub and its variants (for M-JPEG AVI to DIVX AVI conversion), FlaskMPEG, XMPEG Pro (for MPEG to AVI DIVX conversion) DIVX PRO Encoder (for MPEG/AVI/MOV/QT to DIV/DIVX format or AVI/MOV/QT DIVX format) and many more. There is no need for dual or multi-pass encoding, if you set enough bitrate (at least above 700 Kbit/sec for 720x576) and best possible quality. As a novice guide, 700Kbit/sec video data rate and 96kbit/sec audio data rate will fit 2 hours of video in a 80min (700MB) CD-R disc. Keeping audio data rate at 96Kbit/sec, for up to 90 minutes use 960 Kbit/sec video data rate which will give far better quality. For up to 60 minutes use 1500Kbit/sec which will give excellent quality for standard definition video (720x576 for PAL, 720x480 for NTSC).
*  For DVD Authoring you have to convert the final rendered video file in MPEG 2 (MPG/MPEG) if it is not already in this format (some consumer level DVD Authoring applications may also accept AVI/MOV/QT files, but it is not recommended as their rendering quality is usually inferior to that of a dedicated video editing application) and as for the bitrate, 5000 Kbit/sec is the minimum acceptable quality and will fit 2 hours in a standard (single layer) DVD disc, while 9500 Kbit/sec is the maximum DVD compatible (not all consumer grade programs support it) and will give about 1 hour of excellent quality on the same disc. Of course you can use anything between but don't forget to use the SAME settings from capturing, editing and to the final rendering to avoid unnecessary re-encoding and minimize compression artifacts. If you had set rather high bitrates and the final DVD files don't fit in a single layer DVD (about 4480MB), don't worry. You can use Nero Recode, DVD Shrink or similar utility to recompress it at exactly 4480MB. To minimise degradation use dual pass encoding (this in DVD Shrink is called Deep Analysis). This may take some more time, but for sizes about 75% to 100% of the original DVD folder size, you won't notice any difference.
*  For DVD audio you can either use Dolby Digital 2.0 (Stereo) or MPEG Layer II format. I consider 192 Kbit/sec adequate, so you leave more space for video data on a DVD disc. Of course Dolby Digital 2.0 will give better sound than MPEG at the same bitrate since it is more efficiently compressed than the much older MPEG Layer II and it is compared to MP3 (MPEG Layer III) compression which at 192 Kbit/sec Stereo is almost CD quality. Of course the audio format for DVD compatibility is 48000Hz (48KHz) 16-bit per channel, and Stereo or Mono. Don't make the common mistake to capture at 44.1KHz (CD quality) because later you may experience audio sync problems when the DVD Authoring application may wrongly suppose audio is at 48Khz (DVD compatible)! Yes, I have seen this problem in consumer grade DVD Authoring applications, for example Sonic DVDIt. Fortunately most video capturing applications will force the correct settings if the DVD template is chosen.
*  DVD Audio Note: Most consumer level video capture applications do not support audio capturing directly at Dolby Digital 2.0 format, even if the DVD template is chosen. Don't worry, you can capture audio at MPEG Layer II format and convert it to Dolby Digital 2.0 at the Authoring stage using a compatible DVD Authoring application, such as Pinnacle Studio Pro, DVDIt! etc (degradation in quality from conversion between audio formats is not gererally noticeable as it is when converting video from one format to another). For better quality you could try capturing at a higher rate (eg 256Kbit/sec or 384Kbit/sec) for MPEG sound and then select to encode sound to 192Kbit/sec Dolby Digital 2.0 in the Authoring application before proceeding with the rendering step. Don't forget the 48KHz setting, or you will most likely end up with audio sync problems which cannot be fixed!!! You will have to render the DVD data again, provided the original audio format is in 48KHz, otherwise you may have to capture the video again! So take care to avoid frustration! I cannot emphazise more the need to use correct settings for the intended final video format (eg DVD). And don't forget: Using the same settings (resolution, bitrare etc) from capturing to rendering will save you time and provide the best possible quality for the selected settings, based on your hardware and software used.

When calibrating your telecine setup as good as it gets, the results are amazingly good considering the method used, and best of all it is for FREE!

I hope that this amateur telecine guide was helpful. Good luck to anyone trying that. I know the video digitization section should be in another place in Wikipedia and Moviemaker Manual. Excuse me for this lengthy reference to video digitization, but I was trying to help novices.

===Film Editing Software===

Apple Computer develops Cinema Tools with Final Cut Pro.  Final Cut Pro (and Cinema Tools) are purchased as part of Final Cut Studio.  You use Cinema Tools to keep track of all the original frames for each piece of film before it was telecined into the computer.  '''NOTE: Please explain the Cinema Tools process.&quot;''

==Resolutions==
* 4k - 4,096 pixels across
* 2k - 2,048 pixels across
* 1k - 1,024 pixels across
* HD - 1920 x 1080 called also as 1080p or 1080i 
     - 1280 x 720  called also as 720p or 720i
        p = progressive, i = interlaced frame's
* PAL -  720 x 576 
* NTSC - 720 x 480 

It's unlikely that your telecine machine will be able to capture high resolution images in 'real time'.  For example, most telecine machines can only do a 4k capture at about 6 frames per second.

In comparison, I had once read in a Super 8mm newsgroup that Kodachrome 40 (discontinued in 2005) had a resolution of approximately 2048x1536 (3 Megapixels). This was determined experimentally by a poster, and it means that if film had discrete pixels like digital video, Super 8mm Kodachrome could capture at 2048x1536 resolution (2K). Super8 mm film is snubbed by some professional filmmakers, who state that it can show limited detail (and a lot of grain) compared with larger formats. But even this humble format can show better definition than HD video (currently 1920x1080 maximum).

==Lighting Conventions==
Broadcast, Video, and Film Productions share common lighting conventions. Due to the fact that most lighting tools were originally developed for film, with a few tools introduced for video, the equipment carries ratings and specifications are standardized for film. All the lighting tools found in a decently equipped video production studio have direct relatives (usually just larger, brighter and more expensive) in a film production studio.

==Electricity==
Every lighting fixture uses electricity. How much it requires and in what form varies on the application of the light(s). The electrical description consists of Voltage, Amperage, and Wattage. Commonly, studio lights use 115± (plus or minus) 5 Volts (''V'') or &quot;225±5 V&quot;. The amperages (''amperes'' or ''amps'') and wattages (''Watts'' or ''W'') vary depending on the fixture, bulb type, and light output. 115V lights range from 10W (LEDs) up to 2000W-2500W (Halogen-Quartz), 225V range also from 10W to 4500W-5000W.

==Terminology==

;Bulbs: Refers to the actual light source. Most bulbs consist of a filament, insulating gas, and a glass encasement.  Also known as &quot;lamps,&quot; or &quot;globes.&quot;
;Fixtures: The cases or enclosures that hold a bulb, and often serve the purpose of directing the light. Fixtures range from simple bulb holders (such as ''clamp lights''), to elaborate mechanisms (such as ''Source Four'').  Also known as &quot;heads,&quot; or &quot;instruments.&quot;
;Mounts: A device that holds the light where you want it to be. Some clamp to overhead lighting grids, while others are stands.
;Power (''AC''): The power source or the power supply. Where the light is getting its electricity.

==Lighting equipment==

[[Image:Lighting_kit.jpg|thumb|150px|Lighting kit just after it's been loaded off the van.  [http://jack-kelly.com/gallery More production stills here.]]]

Lighting equipment consists of a great deal more than just sockets with bulbs. Lighting equipment (briefly) consists of bulbs (usually called 'lamps'), fixtures, dimmers/power units, mounts, light control/quality.

=====Redheads=====
Redheads are a specific type of open-faced light made by [http://www.ianiro.com/ Ianiro]. They usually offer tungsten 1000W. They are also known as Mickey-Moles (when made by Mole-Richardson). The term Redhead comes from the reddish color of the original fiber casing and is often used to loosely describe smaller, open-faced lights.

=====Blondes=====
Blondes are a 2k open-faced light. Because they are open-faced, they tend to put out more light than a 2k Fresnel.

==Bulb Types==
Video/Film recording lights use many different bulb types. Some are standards from Edison (tungsten) but others are cutting edge of the 2000s (LED). Most bulb types use a filament-ignition process to produce light. A wire of some electrically excitable material is put under voltage in an oxygen-depleted environment, causing it to 'burn' without lighting afire. Fluorescent bulbs and LEDs function rather differently from filament bulbs. 

===Tungsten===
A tungsten light is basically a more powerful version of a common household light bulb. While a household light bulb may only take a few hundred watts at most, lights that are used to light film sets are easily 1000 watts (1K) and often over 20,000 watts (20K). The tungsten light bulb naturally produces an orange hue, similar to indoor lights. Tungsten lights have a color temperature ranging from 3200 to 3400 Kelvin. One typically uses a [[CTB (''color temperature blue'') filter]] to balance the color temperature with outdoor or HMI light.

===Halogen-Quartz===
Halogen-Quartz bulbs, often known as &quot;Halogens&quot; or &quot;Quartz&quot; are a staple of lighting. Halogens rarely posses a color temperature outside of 3200°K. These same bulbs are often used in car headlights, portable work-lights, and recently in house-decor lighting. The bulbs come in wattages ranging from 15W-3500W. Additionally they are manufactured in a wide range of enclosures, bases, and connectors. Common are the &quot;T&quot;, and bayonet base. Halogens emit significant amounts of heat during operation, so much so that oils on the glass surface of the bulb case lead to uneven heat distribution and rupturing (through thermal shock to the glass) or heat build-up and exploding gas within the bulb.

===HMI===
An HMI light is used very often to light film sets. One requires a ballast in order to power and creates a loud noise when turning on, so it is set protocol to yell &quot;striking&quot; in order to warn others on set to both ignore the noise and avoid looking at the light. The HMI light is a different type of light bulb than the more common tungsten. An HMI emits ultra-violet lights and emits a blue hue. HMI lights produce a color temperature around 5600 Kelvin. One typically use a [[CTO (''color temperature orange'') filter]] to balance the color temperature with indoor or tungsten light.

===Fluorescent===
Fluorescent bulbs were not used for lighting film and video until recently. This was because of problems with flicker and a tendency to emit more of a greenish hue. The Fluorescent lights used in film now are made to be flicker-free and come in both daylight and tungsten balanced bulbs. &quot;Kino-flo&quot; is one of the major companies involved in making fluorescent bulbs and fixtures for film and video production. Fluorescent lights tend to be very soft, but do not put out much light in comparison to other lighting instruments.

===LED===
Until the last five to ten years Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) have seen little implementation. Recent advances in production costs and chemical advances used in the diode junctions have led to inexpensive LED 'bulbs' as well as even color temperatures in multiple bulbs. LEDs are manufactured in all colors, and white comes in many color temperatures; 3200K being the most common, but ranging from 3000K to 5600K+. Diodes, due to their engineered design tend to have a very directional light. The front lens is parabolic, focusing the light to a small dot even several meters away.

==Light Control, Quality, and Appearance==

===Lighting Shape/Area===

There are a number of tools used to control where light falls. Often these are used to prevent light falling where it is not needed. In other circumstances a pattern created by the light is desired.

====Barn Doors====
Perhaps the most common form of lighting area shaping, barn doors are found around the front outside of the fixture. Most commonly there are four barn doors forming a square around the fixture, but the numbers vary for specialty applications.

Basically, barn doors block the light from hitting an area of the set or frame you don't want them to. They swing towards and away from the fixture opening.

====Gobos====
Gobos shape the light. Many gobos appear to be shapes cut in a cookie sheet (and indeed many are) but they consist of a material able to withstand the heat put out by the fixture, with shapes cut out for the light to travel through.

Think of gobos as jack o' lanterns.

====Flags &amp; Cutters====
A flag or cutter can be any item that blocks light. A standard flag on set can be of varying sizes. The standard flag is attached to a small metal handle and short rod that can be attached to a C-Stand and placed so that it blocks the light from hitting something in the shot. Flags can be used to prevent light from hitting background walls, for example, leaving only the central subject/s in the light.

Types of flags include singles &amp; doubles to cut down hard light. Solids to block light. Silks, though similar, are translucent and used to diffuse, rather than block light.

====Blackwrap====

Blackwrap is essentially aluminum foil, but covered in black paint. It is often used to block light and kill any spill from a light.  Blackwrap can be shaped however you like to affect where the light falls.  It is useful in narrowing larger lights to point lights or spots or making lights non-circular.  It is very inexpensive, light weight and more flexible than barn doors.  However, it will burn on too hot a light, so watch for smoke.  Blackwrap(TM) is a product from the company, Gam Products Inc.  A similar product, CineFoil(TM) is made by Rosco Laboratories Inc.

===Lighting Intensity===

====Focus====
Adjusting the focus on a focusable light changes the distance between the actual bulb and a lens at the end of the light.  This affects how diffuse the light is.  Closer to the lens spreads the light out more, whereas farther back makes it closer to a spot.  Try to do this before the light gets too hot, so you can adjust it without burning yourself.

====Neutral Density Filters====

Neutral density filters are a variety of gel (or camera filter) which reduces all colors of light equally, making a light less intense without altering its color.  This can be added on top of color gels or used on its own to make a light less intense.

===Lighting Quality===


====Gels====
Gels are thin and translucent. They come in rolls that can be cut into a more manageable size when needed. While a gel can be any color, there are two main colors which are referred to as Color Temperature Orange (CTO) and Color Temperature Blue (CTB). These two types of gel are respectively orange and blue, with varying degrees of darkness broken up into 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, and Full. Full is the darkest and 1/8 is the lightest. When asking for a gel, one may say &quot;I'd like a quarter CTO put on this light.&quot;

Gels are attached to a light in order to alter their color temperature. Tungsten lights produce an orange hue, while HMI's produce a blue hue. If filming outside with tungsten lights, gels would be needed to match the color temperature of the daylight if the DP wanted all the light to be the same color temperature. Daylight produces a blue hue like an HMI light, so CTB would be needed to be placed on all the tungsten lights. Gels are attached to lights with clothespins, also called &quot;C-47's.&quot;

Besides CTO and CTB, to work with fluorescent lights or a &quot;kino flo&quot;, there are &quot;plus green&quot; and &quot;minus green&quot; gels. Since fluorescent lights produce a green hue, a minus green gel would remove the green hue from a fluorescent light and a plus green gel would help match a non-fluorescent light to a fluorescent.

=====Attaching=====
Some lights have clips for attaching gels, but the most common method of attaching them is via wooden clothespins (also referred to as C47s, pegs, or bullets).  These clothespins will begin to smoke before the gels, so you can prevent your gels from being ruined, and they also don't conduct heat, so they can be manipulated even on a very hot light.  They can also be reversed to give them a longer mouth, allowing you to use them to pull scrims from hot fixtures. Once reversed, they often go by C-74's or &quot;scrim pullers&quot;.

==General Lighting==

Here is the nitty-gritty of the page. Although different formats have varying needs in both quantity and quality of light, the underlying yet critical concepts of lighting are fairly applicable to any medium.

==Lighting Digital Video==

'''Dynamic range'''. There are many differences between [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dv DV] and film, but one that particularily stands out regarding lighting is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stops_%28Dynamic_Range%29 dynamic range].

Most DV and video cameras have a relatively low dynamic range. (I.ex. the Sony PD150 has about 4-5 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stops_%28Dynamic_Range%29 stops], and Kodak's 50D film has up to 11). This means the range between the completely black and the whitest white is very low. One therefore has to keep this in mind while lighting. This has been an integral part of cinematography since the beginning. Controlling so one can see details in the darkest area of an image, and also in the brightest. One can always adjust the contrast in post ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading Colorgrading]). This style of working is called shooting for post. (The DV standard has an ok light intensity resolution, so adjusting contrast in post is not as difficult as adjusting color.)

'''White balance'''. As the DV standard has a low color-resolution, it is important to control and know how to filter and white balance the image on set. It has been proved difficult to adjust color in post with a good result, although it has been done. Regarding lighting, be aware of the possibilities the white balance setting on the camera have, and use gels on the lamps, and sometimes on windows to create a neutral image.

In return for these shortcomings, DV-cameras can be more light-sensitive than most film stocks, and therefore require less light intensity, to give the same image. (PD150 is about 320ASA versus Kodak's 50D's 50ASA. One would need about 8 times more light, to get the same image at the same F-stop). Although high ASA film is available.

You just do what you have to do.

This is a book to complement the ''[[Data Structures]]'' book and the ''[[Algorithms]]'' book, and assumes these books as prerequisites.

There are two conflicting goals in online book writing:

* to be an introduction to fundamental material 
* to be a complete reference work that includes discussions of tangential material 

We've decided to do both. The ''Data Structures'' text and the ''Algorithms'' text focus on just the fundamentals. This book (''Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms'') is a place for reference material. The idea is that a student in the span of a year or less can cover those fundamentals and then move on the advanced topics in this book.

== Possible topics ==

* Parallel Programming (section; an elaboration of divide and conquer, or pipeline decoupling for streaming algorithms) 
* Memory Management and Garbage Collection (whole chapter) 
* NP-Completeness (whole chapter) 
* Proof of the master theorem (section) 
* Quadtrees and [[Wikipedia:Octree|Octree]]s and [[Wikipedia: R-tree| R-tree]]s (chapter)
* B-trees (chapter) 
* (pseudo) random number generators 
* Introspective Sort (section; a hybrid sorting algorithm) 
* Closures ( [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatIsClosure What Is Closure?] )
* Continuations ( [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ContinuationExplanation continuations] )
* Cache-Aware and Cache-Oblivious Algorithms
* Approximation
* Maximum Flow
* Primality testing

While there is no content here yet, please feel free to start writing sections! Because this book is more of a reference, chapters can be more independent of each other. Further, you can assume the reader already knows the basic data-structures and algorithms.

=== FFT Multiplication* ===
As covered in the Algorithms book, by breaking an integer into two parts and treating it as a polynomial, we were able to derive a better-than-grade-school multiplication algorithm. Even more gains in efficiency can be made if we break the integer into three parts instead. However, we don't need to stop there: we can generalize the technique of polynomial multiplication and interpolation by breaking an ''n'' digit binary number into a degree ''n'' polynomial, which breaks the number up into its individual digits (and is the furthest we can divide such a number).

We noticed that evaluating the polynomial representations at points 1, -1, and 0 made the expressions easy, but if we are to use degree-2n polynomials, how can we come up with enough points to use? The trick is to evaluate the polynomial using complex numbers, in particular, by using &quot;roots of unity&quot;: that is, complex numbers that are all distance 1 from the origin.

=== Tree-List ===

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_%28computer_science%29

When dealing with lists, we normally have two choices: either we get &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; indexed access but &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; insertion with vectors, or &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; indexing and &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; insertion with linked lists. It'd be nice if we could find some middle ground, say with &lt;math&gt;O(\log N)&lt;/math&gt; (amortized) running time for all operations. Well, Soren Sandmann has implemented [http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/nautilus/cut-n-paste-code/gsequence/ GSequence], which uses a splay tree to achieve exactly that. ''[TODO: This structure doesn't have a widely accepted name yet. If someone can think of a better name, suggest it.]''

''I think B-tree algorithms give worst-case O(ln(N)) insertion, deletion, and access by name. Is GSequence better in some way? I've been told that some operating systems stored files and directories on disk as B-trees. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 23:39, 21 July 2005 (UTC)''

''There's a number of balanced trees that give O(ln N) performance. The idea here is just wrapping a list interface around a tree. You might as well just say that you can use a tree since a list interface is only for implementation convenience.''

''There are various heap data structures that give O(log(N)) insertion, deletion and access by name.''

''I believe these are called random-access lists.  Also, it is possible to get O(1) insertion and O(log N) indexing; e.g. Okasaki's skew-binomial random access lists.  If there is an interest, I can upload a demonstration-quality implementation in Common Lisp.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Other Questions?==
Are there other questions we should answer? Culture? Religion? Music? Any ideas? [[User:Lyellin|Lyellin]] 01:37, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

: Oh yes, definitely. I was in fact hoping this issue to focus primarily on those topics. Really, cover whatever you want to write about. Extra content online is a major bonus if we can get it. A few years from now, I hope we're at the stage with content and funds that we could publish issues on single countries, or at least groups.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

==Racism==

The only country in the whole of South Americas that's primarily white is Argentina, the rest are primarily Indian or Black. South America is composed of '''mestizo''' (Indian - European), '''mulatto''' (Black - European) or '''mestizo-mulatto''' (Indian - Black - European) people. The white people are a small minority everywhere except Argentina. Are these facts reflected in the books? No, they are not. The books all read like they were written by white supremacists. The only exception is Venezuela and only because I fixed it personally. It's one thing to distort the picture by not mentioning the blatant racism in South America, it takes it to a whole other extreme when you distort such an obvious thing as ethnicity. [[User:70.26.56.242|70.26.56.242]] 21:08, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

:Actually, many of the [[Wikijunior:South America]] modules are stubs missing much information. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:24, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== El Salvador ==

Why is El Salvador not in this book?
Is it because it is in fact in Central America?
Some children in New York think it is in South America, and I'm inviting them to participate in this book, and that's why I should like some correct information. I've had one accusation in regard to this book of passing on incorrect information to children, so I should not like another on my conscience.
--[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 00:57, 19 January 2006 (UTC).

:Some people consider Mexico to be in South America too.  Look at a map of North America and you will see some important differences.  From a geological viewpoint, El Salvador is actually in North America (it is physically on the Carribian plate, often associated in physical geography with North America) even if it has strong cultural ties to South American coutries.  For now, all we are trying to do is to somehow limit the range of countries that are involved with this Wikibook.  We really do need to eventually expand and move into other regions, and often Central America and the Carribian nations are geographically linked together.  Also, distinguishing between Anglo-America and Latin-America is very artificial and overly broad as well.  And tends to gloss over important groups like French-speaking people in Quebec, Louisiana (OK, Creole there) or Haiti. Or the Pennsylvania Dutch for that matter.  There is also a huge difference in culture between Mexico and Argentina, even though the typical American doesn't see any difference.

:In this regard, don't try to spread misinformation that El Salvador is in South America.  In addition, we do want to get to the Central American countries as well at some time in the future but not at the moment.  I am glad that you are trying to help improve this Wikibook, and I hope that the kids that you are encouraging to work on this have been enjoying the experience.  They would be a group of kids writing for kids, and that is exciting by itself.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:10, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

== Aztecs? ==

There is a page on Incas, why not the Aztecs? [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 14:18, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

: The Aztecs lived in North America. Where Mexico is now. --[[User:Xixtas|Xixtas]] 02:28, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

== Revitalizing Wikijunior South America ==
In my opinion, Wikijunior South America doesn't really work as is. I think there are probably reasons rooted in it being the third book to be started and the push that happened on the first two books for it being as undeveloped as it is. 

I find the history/culture/geography approach to be kind of dry. I think that most kids wouldn't find these articles to be very interesting. I would like to propose a major reworking of the book, with new questions, and a new development effort. A relaunch almost. I think we need questions that are more directly relevant to kid's experience.

The new set of questions I would propose for each country are: 
*What are %country's% national symbols? ''
:(Flag, Animal, Seal, etc.)''
*What are some famous places in %country%? ''
:(Historic places, Big Cities, Natural Features)''
*What important events have happened in %country%? 
:''(European Contact, Founding, Elections, Millitary Conflicts.)''
*What is the natural environment like in %country%? 
:''(Natural Geography, Climate, Animals, Nature Preserves)''
*What types of things are exported from %country%? 
:''(Business &amp; Economy Overview, GNP, Free-Market/State-Run, Natural Resources)''
*What is school like in %country%? 
:''(Language, Education System, Age of students, Education levels of kids and adults, Universities)''
*What is the food like in %country%? 
:''(Agriculture, Local dishes, specific foods eaten (eg. beef, plantains)''
*What music is popular in %country%? 
:''(Indigenous music forms, popularity of music from other parts of the world, dancing)''
*What sports are popular in %country%? 
:''(Football (soccer), Olympic Athletes, Notable athletes playing internationally.)'' 
*Who are some famous people from %country%? 
:''(2 sentence biographies, writers, politicians)''

Is anyone else up for this kind of effort? --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 05:56, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

:I have been working on [[Wikijunior:South America/Colombia|Colombia]] to demonstrate how these articles might look. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 21:38, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Parametric polymorphism (generic units) ==

The idea of code reuse arises from the necessity for constructing large software systems combining well-established building blocks. The reusability of code improves the productivity and the quality of software. The generic units are one of the ways in which the Ada language supports this characteristic. A generic unit is a subprogram or package that defines algorithms in terms of types and operations that are not defined until the user instantiates them.

Note to C++ programmers: generic units are similar to C++ templates.

For example, to define a procedure for swapping variables of any (non-limited) type:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};  {{Ada/--|Generic formal type parameter}}
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Swap (X, Y : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Element_T);

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Swap (X, Y : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Element_T) {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Temporary : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Element_T := X;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   X := Y;
   Y := Temporary;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Swap;

The &lt;tt&gt;Swap&lt;/tt&gt; subprogram is said to be generic. The subprogram specification is preceded by the generic formal part consisting of the reserved word {{Ada/kw|generic}} followed by a list of generic formal parameters which may be empty. The entities declared as generic are not directly usable, it is necessary to instantiate them.

To be able to use &lt;tt&gt;Swap&lt;/tt&gt;, it is necessary to create an instance for the wanted type. For example:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Swap_Integers {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Swap (Integer);

Now the &lt;tt&gt;Swap_Integers&lt;/tt&gt; procedure can be used for variables of type &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt;.

The generic procedure can be instantiated for all the needed types. It can be instantiated with different names or, if the same identifier is used in the instantiation, each declaration overloads the procedure:

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Instance_Swap {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Swap (Float);
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Instance_Swap {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Swap (Day_T);
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Instance_Swap {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Swap (Element_T =&gt; Stack_T);

Similarly, generic packages can be used, for example, to implement a stack of any kind of elements:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
   Max: Positive; 
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Generic_Stack {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Push (E: Element_T);
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Pop return Element_T;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Stack;

 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Generic_Stack {{Ada/kw|is}}
   Stack: {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. Max) {{Ada/kw|of}} Element_T;
   Top  : Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 .. Max := 0;  {{Ada/comment|initialise to empty}}
   {{Ada/--|...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Stack;

A stack of a given size and type could be defined in this way:

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
   {{Ada/kw|package}} Float_100_Stack {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Generic_Stack (100, Float);
   {{Ada/kw|use}} Float_100_Stack;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   Push (45.8);
   {{Ada/--|...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

== Generic parameters ==

The generic unit declares ''generic formal parameters'', which can be:

* objects (of mode ''in'' or ''in out'' but never ''out'')
* types
* subprograms
* instances of another, designated, generic unit.

When instantiating the generic, the programmer passes one ''actual parameter'' for each formal.  Formal values and subprograms can have defaults, so passing an actual for them is optional.

=== Generic formal objects ===

Formal parameters of mode ''in'' accept any value, constant, or variable of the designated type.  The actual is copied into the generic instance, and behaves as a
constant inside the generic; this implies that the designated type cannot be limited.  It is possible to specify a default value, like this:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    Object : {{Ada/kw|in}} Natural := 0;

For mode ''in out'', the actual must be a variable.

One limitation with generic formal objects is that they are never considered static, even if the actual happens to be static.   If the object is a number, it cannot be used to create a new type.  It can however be used to create a new derived type, or a subtype:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    Size : {{Ada/kw|in}} Natural := 0;
 {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} T1 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|mod}} Size; {{Ada/comment|illegal!}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} T2 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. Size; {{Ada/comment|illegal!}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} T3 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. Size; {{Ada/comment|OK}}
    {{Ada/kw|subtype}} T4 {{Ada/kw|is}} Integer {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. Size; {{Ada/comment|OK}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

The reason why formal objects are nonstatic is to allow the compiler to emit the object code for the generic only once, and to have all instances share it, passing it the address of their actual object as a parameter.  This bit of compiler technology is called ''shared generics''.  If formal objects were static, the compiler would have to emit one copy of the object code, with the object embedded in it, for each instance, potentially leading to an explosion in object code size (''code bloat'').

(Note to C++ programmers: in C++, since formal objects can be static, the compiler cannot implement shared generics in the general case; it would have to examine the entire body of the generic before deciding whether or not to share its object code.  In contrast, Ada generics are designed so that the compiler can instantiate a generic ''without looking at its body''.)

=== Generic formal types ===

The syntax allows the programmer to specify which type categories are acceptable as actuals. As a rule of thumb: The syntax expresses how the generic sees the type, i.e. it assumes the worst, not how the creator of the instance sees the type.

This is the syntax of RM {{Ada/RM|12|5}}:

  formal_type_declaration ::=
    {{Ada/kw|type}} defining_identifier[discriminant_part] {{Ada/kw|is}} formal_type_definition;
  
  formal_type_definition ::= formal_private_type_definition
                           | formal_derived_type_definition
                           | formal_discrete_type_definition
                           | formal_signed_integer_type_definition
                           | formal_modular_type_definition
                           | formal_floating_point_definition
                           | formal_ordinary_fixed_point_definition
                           | formal_decimal_fixed_point_definition
                           | formal_array_type_definition
                           | formal_access_type_definiton
                           | formal_interface_type_definition

This is quite complex, so some examples are given below. A type declared with the syntax &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; denotes a type with ''unknown discriminants''. This is the Ada vernacular for indefinite types, i.e. types for which objects cannot be declared without giving an initial expression. An example of such a type is one with a discriminant without default, another example is an unconstrained array type.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Generic formal type || Acceptable actual types
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}};&lt;/code&gt; || Any type at all.  The actual type can be [[Ada Programming/Types/limited|limited]] or not, indefinite or definite, but the ''generic'' treats it as limited and indefinite, i.e. does not assume that assignment is available for the type.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};&lt;/code&gt; || Any nonlimited type: the generic knows that it is possible to assign to variables of this type, but it is not possible to declare objects of this type without initial value.

The generic knows about &lt;code&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt;'s operations, so can call them.  Neither &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt; can be abstract.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|abstract}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Parent {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|private}};&lt;/code&gt; || Any type, abstract or concrete, derived from &lt;code&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;Parent&lt;/code&gt; is a tagged type, so calls to &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;'s operations can dispatch dynamically.

|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|delta}} &lt;&gt; {{Ada/kw|digits}} &lt;&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; || Any decimal fixed point type
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|digits}} &lt;&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; || Any [[Ada Programming/Types/digits|floating point type]]

|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (I) {{Ada/kw|of}} E;  || Any [[Ada Programming/Types/array|array type]] with index of type &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; and elements of type &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt; could be formal parameters as well)
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|access}} O;&lt;/code&gt; || Any [[Ada Programming/Types/access|access type]] pointing to objects of type &lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;O&lt;/code&gt; could be a formal parameter as well)
|}

In the body we can only use the operations predefined for the type category of the formal parameter. That is, the generic specification is a contract  between the generic implementor and the client instantiating the generic unit. This is different to the parametric features of other languages, such as C++.

It is possible to further restrict the set of acceptable actual types like so:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Generic formal type !! Acceptable actual types
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}}&lt;/code&gt;... || Definite or indefinite types (loosely speaking: types with or without discriminants, but other forms of indefiniteness exist)
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T (D : DT) {{Ada/kw|is}}&lt;/code&gt;... || Types with a discriminant of type DT (it is possible to specify several discriminants, too)
|-
|&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|type}} T {{Ada/kw|is}}&lt;/code&gt;... || Definite types (loosely speaking types without a discriminant or with a discriminant with default value)
|}

=== Generic formal subprograms ===

It is possible to pass a subprogram as a parameter to a generic.  The generic
specifies a generic formal subprogram, complete with parameter list and return
type (if the subprogram is a function). The actual must match this parameter
profile.  It is not necessary that the ''names'' of parameters match, though.

Here is the specification of a generic subprogram that takes another subprogram
as its parameter:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
   {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;*&quot; (X, Y: Element_T) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element_T;
 {{Ada/kw|function}} Square (X : Element_T) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element_T;

And here is the body of the generic subprogram; it calls parameter as it would
any other subprogram.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Square (X: Element_T) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/kw|return}} X * X;   {{Ada/--|The formal operator &quot;*&quot;.}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Square;

This generic function could be used, for example, with matrices, having defined the matrix product.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Square;
 {{Ada/kw|with}} Matrices;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Matrix_Example {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Square_Matrix {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Square
     (Element_T =&gt; Matrices.Matrix_T, &quot;*&quot; =&gt; Matrices.Product);
   A : Matrices.Matrix_T := Matrices.Identity;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   A := Square_Matrix (A);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Matrix_Example;

It is possible to specify a default with &quot;the box&quot; (&lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/delimiter|&lt;&gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;), like this:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
   {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
   {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;*&quot; (X, Y: Element_T) {{Ada/kw|return}} Element_T {{Ada/kw|is}} &lt;&gt;;

This means that if, at the point of instantiation, a function &quot;*&quot; exists for the
actual type, and if it is directly visible, then it will be used by default as the
actual subprogram.

One of the main uses is passing needed operators. The following example shows this &lt;small&gt;(follow download links for full example)&lt;/small&gt;:

   {{Ada/Sourceforge|Algorithms/binary_search.adb}}

   {{Ada/kw|generic}}
      {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
      ''...''
      {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;&lt;&quot;
        (Left  : {{Ada/kw|in}} Element_Type;
         Right : {{Ada/kw|in}} Element_Type)
         {{Ada/kw|return}}  Boolean
      {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/delimiter|&lt;&gt;}};
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Search
     (Elements : {{Ada/kw|in}} Array_Type;
      Search   : {{Ada/kw|in}} Element_Type;
      Found    : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean;
      Index    : {{Ada/kw|out}} Index_Type'{{Ada/attribute|Base}})
      ''...''

=== Generic instances of other generic packages ===

A generic formal can be a package; it must be an instance of a generic package, so that the generic knows the interface exported by the package:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Q ({{Ada/delimiter|&lt;&gt;}});

This means that the actual must be an instance of the generic package Q.  The box after Q means that we do not care which actual generic parameters were used to create the actual for P.  It is possible to specify the exact parameters, or to specify that the defaults must be used, like this:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/comment|P1 must be an instance of Q with the specified actual parameters:}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|package}} P1 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Q (Param1 =&gt; X, Param2 =&gt; Y);
 
    {{Ada/comment|P2 must be an instance of Q where the actuals are the defaults:}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|package}} P2 {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Q;
 
It is all or nothing: if you specify the generic parameters, you must specify all of them.  Similarly, if you specify no parameters and no box, then all the generic formal parameters of Q must have defaults.  The actual package must, of course, match these constraints.

The generic sees both the public part and the generic parameters of the actual package (Param1 and Param2 in the above example).

This feature allows the programmer to pass arbitrarily complex types as parameters
to a generic unit, while retaining complete type safety and encapsulation. ''(example needed)''

It is not possible for a package to list itself as a generic formal, so no generic recursion is possible.  The following is illegal:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} A;
 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} A ({{Ada/delimiter|&lt;&gt;}});
 {{Ada/kw|package}} A; {{Ada/comment|illegal: A references itself}}

In fact, this is only a particular case of:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} A; {{Ada/comment|illegal: A does not exist yet at this point!}}
 {{Ada/kw|package}} A;

which is also illegal, despite the fact that A is no longer generic.

== Instantiating generics ==

To instantiate a generic unit, use the keyword '''new''':

 {{Ada/kw|function}} Square_Matrix {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Square
    (Element_T =&gt; Matrices.Matrix_T, &quot;*&quot; =&gt; Matrices.Product);

Notes of special interest to C++ programmers:

* The generic formal types define ''completely'' which types are acceptable as actuals; therefore, the compiler can instantiate generics without looking at the body of the generic.
* Each instance has a name and is different from all other instances.  In particular, if a generic package declares a type, and you create two instances of the package, then you will get two different, incompatible types, even if the actual parameters are the same.
* Ada requires that all instantiations be explicit.
* It is not possible to create special-case instances of a generic (known as &quot;template specialisation&quot; in C++).

As a consequence of the above, Ada does not permit template metaprogramming.  However,
this design has significant advantages:

* the object code can be shared by all instances of a generic, unless of course the programmer has requested that subprograms be inlined; there is no danger of code bloat.
* when reading programs written by other people, there are no hidden instantiations, and no special cases to worry about.  Ada follows the Law of Least Astonishment.

== Advanced generics ==

=== Generics and nesting ===

A generic unit can be nested inside another unit, which itself may be generic.  Even though no special rules apply (just the normal rules about generics and the rules about nested units), novices may be confused.  It is important to understand the difference between a generic unit and ''instances'' of a generic unit.

'''Example 1'''. A generic subprogram nested in a nongeneric package.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Bag_Of_Strings {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Bag {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|generic}}
       {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} String);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Apply_To_All (B : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Bag);
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Bag_Of_Strings;

To use '''Apply_To_All''', you first define the procedure to be applied to each String in the Bag.  Then, you instantiate '''Apply_To_All''', and finally you call the instance.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Bag_Of_Strings;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Example_1 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} String) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|separate}}; {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize_All {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All (Operator =&gt; Capitalize);
    B : Bag_Of_Strings.Bag;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Capitalize_All (B);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Example_1;

'''Example 2.''' A generic subprogram nested in a generic package

This is the same as above, except that now the Bag itself is generic:

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_Type (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Generic_Bag {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Bag {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|generic}}
       {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Element_Type);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Apply_To_All (B : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Bag);
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Bag;

As you can see, the generic formal subprogram '''Operator''' takes a parameter of the generic formal type '''Element_Type'''.  This is okay: the nested generic sees everything that is in its enclosing unit.

You cannot instantiate '''Generic_Bag.Apply_To_All''' directly, so you must first create an instance of '''Generic_Bag''', say '''Bag_Of_Strings''', and then instantiate '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All'''.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Generic_Bag;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Example_2 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} String) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|separate}}; {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|package}} Bag_Of_Strings {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Generic_Bag (Element_Type =&gt; String);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize_All {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All (Operator =&gt; Capitalize);
    B : Bag_Of_Strings.Bag;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Capitalize_All (B);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Example_2;

=== Generics and child units ===

'''Example 3'''. A generic unit that is a child of a nongeneric unit.

Each instance of the generic child is a child of the parent unit, and so it can see the parent's public and private parts.

 {{Ada/kw|package}} Bag_Of_Strings {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Bag {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Bag_Of_Strings; 
 
 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} String);
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All (B : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Bag);

The differences between this and Example 1 are:
* '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All''' is compiled separately.  In particular, '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All''' might have been written by a different person who did not have access to the source text of '''Bag_Of_Strings'''.
* Before you can use '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All''', you must '''with''' it explicitly; '''with'''ing the parent, '''Bag_Of_Strings''', is not sufficient.
* If you do not use '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All''', your program does not contain its object code.
* Because '''Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All''' is at the library level, it can declare controlled types; the nested package could not do that in Ada 95. In Ada 2005, one can declare controlled types at any level.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All; {{Ada/comment|implicitly withs Bag_Of_Strings, too}}
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Example_3 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} String) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|separate}}; {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Capitalize_All {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Bag_Of_Strings.Apply_To_All (Operator =&gt; Capitalize);
    B : Bag_Of_Strings.Bag;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Capitalize_All (B);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Example_3;

'''Example 4'''. A generic unit that is a child of a generic unit

This is the same as Example 3, except that now the Bag is generic, too.

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_Type (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Generic_Bag {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Bag {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Bag;

'''Example 5'''. A parameterless generic child unit

Children of a generic unit '''must''' be generic, no matter what.  If you think about it, it is quite logical: a child unit sees the public and private parts of its parent, including the variables declared in the parent.  If the parent is generic, which instance should the child see?  The answer is that the child must be the child of only one instance of the parent, therefore the child must also be generic.

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Element_Type (&lt;&gt;) {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Hash_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} (&lt;&gt;);
    {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/kw|function}} Hash_Function (E : Element_Type) {{Ada/kw|return}} Hash_Type;
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Generic_Hash_Map {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Map {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|private}};
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Hash_Map;

Suppose we want a child of a '''Generic_Hash_Map''' that can serialise the map to disk; for this it needs to sort the map by hash value.  This is easy to do, because we know that '''Hash_Type''' is a discrete type, and so has a less-than operator.  The child unit that does the serialisation does not need any additional generic parameters, but it must be generic nevertheless, so it can see its parent's generic parameters, public and private part.

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Generic_Hash_Map.Serializer {{Ada/kw|is}}
     {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Dump (Item : {{Ada/kw|in}} Map; To_File : {{Ada/kw|in}} String);
     {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Restore (Item : {{Ada/kw|out}} Map; From_File : {{Ada/kw|in}} String);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Generic_Hash_Map.Serializer;
 
To read and write a map to disk, you first create an instance of '''Generic_Hash_Map''', for example '''Map_Of_Unbounded_Strings''', and then an instance of '''Map_Of_Unbounded_Strings.Serializer''':

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
 {{Ada/kw|with}} Generic_Hash_Map.Serializer;
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Example_5 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
    {{Ada/kw|function}} Hash (S : {{Ada/kw|in}} Unbounded_String) {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|separate}}; {{Ada/comment|omitted}}
    {{Ada/kw|package}} Map_Of_Unbounded_Strings {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Generic_Hash_Map (Element_Type =&gt; Unbounded_String,
                             Hash_Type =&gt; Integer,
                             Hash_Function =&gt; Hash);
    {{Ada/kw|package}} Serializer {{Ada/kw|is}}
       {{Ada/kw|new}} Map_Of_Unbounded_Strings.Serializer;
    M : Map_Of_Unbounded_Strings.Map;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Serializer.Restore (Item =&gt; M, From_File =&gt; &quot;map.dat&quot;);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Example_5;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called GK. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name GK~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can't build a robot without at least a few tools. This page will cover some of the tools and equipment that'll be useful.

==Mechanical Tools==
For building your robot you'll need some tools to form the body.

#Small vise: you'll need this.
#Hammer: A hammer is one of the standard tools you'll need.
#Screwdrivers &amp; Wrenches: their uses are obvious.  Two spanners of equal size are required for locknutting.
#Saw: Metal and wood saws. Miter saws can be very handy, but are pretty expensive. A miter box might suffice for many purposes.
#Square, measuring tape, scriber and other marking out tools.  
#Vernier calipers: Allow very accurate marking out and measurement.  Also can be used to check thread pitch on machine screws without a dedicated pitch gauge.
#Files: especially when working with metal, as rough metal edges are sharp.
#Centre Punch: Essential for accurate drilling of holes in metal to prevent the drill skating over the surface.
#Drill Press: (small table top versions suffice) is very handy for drilling accurate holes.  Can also provide the low speeds for drilling large holes in metal, which hand drills cannot do easily.
#Hobby Tool: Useful for many purposes.
#Sharp utility knifes: Mostly used when working with plastics.
#Hot glue guns: handy for quickly mounting parts. Not too strong bound, but useful for many applications.
#Arc Welder: Only useful when working with thick steel on large projects (use a gas welding torch for thin metal;arc welders tend to burn holes right through the workpiece). Aluminium cannot be welded with ordinary welders. (Unless you have a MIG/MAG or TIG welder available)
#Paint stripper/Electric Heat Gun: like a hairdryer on steroids. Useful for bending plastics, also applying heat-shrink tubing to electric cables at low power.
#Safety Goggles: You only get one pair of eyes, and machine tools are potentially dangerous.  Safety goggles are essential for using anything other than hand tools.

==Electronic Tools==

===Soldering iron===
The soldering iron is a very useful tool for assembling electronic circuits and connecting copper wires together.

For electronic circuits you'll need a light soldering iron (~25W) with a small point (shaped like a pencil point). Especially SMD components require small points (or even better: special SMD soldering points).&lt;BR&gt;
Soldering electronic components is done with &quot;soft soldering&quot;: with a low temperature (less than 300°C). Usually for electronics the melting point of the solder lays around 238°C. When buying solder choose for a solder wire (60% lead, 40% tin) with non-corrosive flux. (There is also &quot;eutectic solder&quot; - 63% lead, 37% tin, which transitions from liquid to solid immediately, with no plastic state in between.)  Take the thinnest wire you can find (&lt;=1mm).

See [http://www.epemag.wimborne.co.uk/solderfaq.htm this page] for an in depth explanation of soldering electronic components.

For connecting metal wires you'll need something more powerful (30W-100W) like a soldering pistol, but an ordinary soldering iron would do just as well.  
Note: not all materials are as good to solder. Copper is easy to solder and has a reasonable strong bond. Aluminum has a weak bond.

For stronger connections it's better to braze instead of soft soldering. Brazing involves higher temperatures (typical between 450°C and 1000°C) and different flux (&quot;Borax&quot;) and solder (copper and zinc or silver alloys) it also requires a welding torch instead of a soldering iron.&lt;BR&gt;
see [http://www.handyharmancanada.com/TheBrazingBook/bbook.htm this online book] for more in depth information on brazing.

If you need even more strength you could use welding. However welding is only used for heavy materials like steel alloys and these are in most cases too heavy to be used in robots (unless you're building a very big or industrial robot). Aluminum can be welded but it isn't as simple as welding steel alloys.&lt;BR&gt;
See [http://www.aussieweld.com.au/arcwelding/index.htm this site for basic welding information].

==Breadboard==
[[File:Breadboard.svg|thumb|Breadboard|100px]]
The boards allow you to build a temporary circuit in no time. Especially handy for testing new circuits. Connections are made with either ordinary thin stiff wire with the insulation removed at the ends or with special breadboard wires with stronger tips. Wires with crocodile clamps are needed for hooking up signal generator, oscilloscope, DMM, etc. Larger boards have connectors (typically banana plugs) for the power supply.

There are small breadboards with an adhesive strip at the bottom. These can be mounted on an empty part of a microcontroller board and can be used to build small circuits.

*'''Note:''' when you build a sensitive analog circuit on a breadboard, it can behave differently than when it's build as a PCB. This is because of parasitic components: the wires connecting the components on the board act as a combination of a resistor, capacitor and coil (all with very low values). Keep in mind that in some circumstances this can affect the working of a circuit. Usually this is only a problem when working with low amplitudes and/or high frequencies.
{{clear}}
==Electronic Equipment==
[[File:Digital Multimeter Aka.jpg|thumb|Digital Multimeter]]
*Multimeter: measures voltage, current &amp; resistance. Many can measure transistor and diode characteristics, frequency and capacity. Some can measure temperature or light intensity.
**Note: measuring voltage and current of a AC source isn't as simple as measuring DC levels. But since robots rarely use AC this would be out of the scope of this text. But if you would require to measure AC levels you should read up on this.

*Oscilloscope: makes a electric signal visible. Very useful when working with more complicated electronic circuits, especially analog signals and data communication. Oscilloscopes exist as stand-alone devices or as add-on modules for PCs. The latter provides extra abilities like spectrum analysing and recording of signals.

*Variable power supplies: power supplies with variable output. Either AC or DC. Either the output voltage or current can be regulated, although most power supplies let you set a max current.

*Signal generators: generates different shapes of signals (sine, square, saw and triangle), with variable frequency (1Hz up to 100MHz) and amplitude.

*Logic probe: pen-like devices that detect logic levels (either TTL or CMOS). Most can detect pulse signals. Very handy when working with digital electronic circuits.

*Frequency meters: measures the frequency of a signal. Can also be used as a pulse counter.  Oscilloscopes can be used for measuring frequency, and storage scopes can freeze a waveform onscreen allowing pulses to be manually counted, but frequency meters are a good investment if this needs to be done very often.

*LEDs: An underrated test device for digital circuits. LEDs are far better than voltmeters for digital circuits in some situations, as you can see many input and output values concurrently, without connecting a multitude of voltmeters or constantly checking everything with a logic probe.  In particular, they can instantly show the status of several logic signals simultaneously, impossible with a logic probe.  Good breadboard building practice also includes an LED for each breadboard to show it is powered up correctly - this can help avoid the potentially frustrating situation of faultfinding a logic circuit that is actually sound, but has an intermittent or noisy power supply.  It's also an excellent indicator if a component is short-circuiting at any time during operation, as the LED will likely dim or go out.

== Connectors ==

=== Insulation Displacement Connectors (IDC) ===

Assembling parallel ribbon cables from ribbon and the IDC connectors:

Practical tips:

#Note that IDC ribbon cable is usually not provided with multicoloured or ‘rainbow’ insulation, but with single-colour insulation — usually grey or white. However it also has a stripe of coloured ink or paint (red or black) down one side, to guide you with connector orientation. If you need to strip away some of the wires of a multi-way cable to suit the IDC
connectors you’re using, remove them from the side furthest from the ink stripe so it’s still present on the cable.
#It’s usual to fit IDC connectors to the cable so their pin 1 end is on the stripe side of the ribbon. This also
helps guide you when you’re mating the cable connectors with those on the equipment, knowing that the stripe
corresponds with pin 1.
#Before clamping an IDC connector to a ribbon cable, make sure that the cable grooves are aligned with the contact jaw tips and that they are also aligned with the scallops moulded into the underside of the clamping strip.
#Make sure too that the connector pin/jaw axis is as close as possible to 90° with respect to the ribbon cable wire axes. If the connector/ribbon angle is not close to 90°, some connections may not be made properly. If the connector is being fitted at the end of a ribbon cable, cutting the end of the ribbon cleanly square first will allow you to use it as a guide.
#Try to squeeze the IDC connector and its clamping strip together as evenly as possible, so they remain as close as possible to parallel with each other during the operation. This too ensures that all joints are made correctly. The easiest way to squeeze them together evenly is by using a small machine vice or a special compound-action clamping tool.
#If an IDC connector has a second cable clamping strip, don’t attempt to fit this as part of the main assembly. Assemble the main parts of the connector first on the ribbon cable, and only then fit the second clamping strip.
#When you are bending the ribbon cable around before fitting the second clamping strip, don’t pull it hard. This may loosen some of the connections inside the IDC connector. Just bend the ribbon around gently — a small amount of slack won’t do any harm, and may in fact protect the IDC connections from strain.

Properly-assembled IDC connector illustration:

http://www1.electusdistribution.com.au/images_uploaded/IDCconnE.pdf


Practical uses:

A common IDC cable in use is an IDC D9 socket to IDC 2 by 5 header socket. This cable is often used to connect a PC serial (RS232) port to a microcontroller development board. On the board there will be a 2 by 5 pin header.

===RJ45 network connector===
[[File:Ethernet_RJ45_connector_p1160054.jpg|thumb|100px|RJ45 Connector]]
These are the connectors used on UTP network cables. A smaller version (RJ11) is used for telephones. You need a crimping tool to attach the connector to the cable. These connectors are very useful for hooking up different PCB with each other. A good use for RJ45 connectors is for making serial (RS232) programming cables for small embedded systems (many credit card terminals use a DB9 to RJ45 cable to download software from a PC during development). If you are building small embedded controller boards an RJ45 can be a handy connector size to use.

      <comment>/* Secessionist movement */ English Arts and Crafts style - changed style to movement (it was a reaction to the loss of traditional skills to industrial manufacturing)</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The twentieth century has seen huge changes in the modes and meanings of artistic production that mirror the enormous social changes that have occurred during the same time period. Continuing with the break with the academic values such as the hierarchy of genres, many movements and many countries re-evaluated aesthetics, technique, color, media, meaning, and many other aspects of artistic enterprise. Technology has had not only an indirect impact on artists, but often is the subject matter, or even the media that artists have worked with. 

The Impressionists, at the end of the nineteenth century, who championed landscape painting and revolutionized technique and use of color helped to open the floodgates for many more movements (not all of which identified themselves as such). The Secession movement, Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, Futurism, Dada, Suprematism, Surrealism, The Bauhaus, De Stijl, Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Op Art, Minimalism, and the Postmodern are some of the major movements that have shaped the century and changed our very conceptions of what art is.

==Secessionist movement==
The Secessionist  movement was the Austrian branch of a larger movement known primarily as Art Nouveau (&quot;new art&quot;). Depending on the country, the style is also known as Jugendstil (Germany), Style Liberty (Italy), Modernisme (Spain), or Latvian Romanticism. Art Nouveau is an umbrella term but also refers to works of this style produced in France and Belgium. Art Nouveau has its roots in the English Arts and Crafts movement of the 19th century; in fact, certain artists, like Charles Rennie Mackintosh, work in both styles. The purpose of Art Nouveau was to create what is known as a complete work of art - a work that includes painting, drawing and printmaking as well as applied arts and architecture. For this reason, some of the most beautiful and informative Art Nouveau works are complete rooms or houses where every object within is executed in Art Nouveau style. Art Nouveau is characterized by free-flowing floral, vegetal, and other typically feminine motifs. It also features a kind of romantic mysticism that can be traced back to the Pre-Raphaelite and Symbolist movements of the 19th century. Some well-known Art Nouveau artists and craftsmen include Alphonse Mucha (Czech), an accomplished printmaker and painter; Antoni Gaudi (Spanish), whose architectural works dot Barcelona; Hector Guimard (French), whose wrought-iron entrances for the Paris metro have become his legacy; Gustav Klimt (Austrian), who led the Austrian Secessionists with his opulent and complex paintings; and Louis Comfort Tiffany (American), who is well-known for his distinctive stained-glass work.

==Fauvism==
Fauvism, whose name derives from the French word for &quot;wild beast,&quot; was a Primitivist movement centered in Paris in the first decade of the 20th century. The most well-known Fauvist artists are Henri Matisse and Andre Derain. The large blocks of color and simplified forms Fauvist artists used undoubtedly influenced the Cubist movement, which overlapped Fauvism by a few years. 

==Cubism==
The Father of Cubism is said to be [[wikipedia:Cezanne|Cezanne]].  Pablo [[wikipedia:Picasso|Picasso]], a Spanish artist, who had many phases in his long career, picked up the gauntlet of Cubism.  His famous &quot;Demoiselles d'Avignon&quot; of 1907, housed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, depicts five nude women, possibly prostitutes, in an interior. The painting is primitivistic - Picasso synthesized his well-documented interest in African masks into the faces of the figures. The fragmentation and flattening of the figures also anticipates the development of analytical Cubism a few years later. One of the Spaniard's most socio-political cubist paintings is &quot;Guernica&quot; of 1937, his grey, black and white portrait of the horrors of war.  The basque town of Guernica was bombed by the German Luftwaffe on April 26, 1937.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Guernica]

Another founding member of the Cubist movement was Georges Braque, a French artist whose analytical Cubist work from the 1910s is quite similar to Picasso's. Braque and Picasso worked together closely, and Braque's influence on Picasso (and vice versa) should not be downplayed. Other major artists of the analytical Cubist movement include Juan Gris, whose interest in mathematics made his art more regularized, and less fragmented, than Picasso's; Marcel Duchamp, whose early, pre-readymade works such as &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase&quot; are highly fragmented and undeniably Cubist; Jean Metzinger; and Albert Gleizes. 

==Futurism==
Futurism was an Italian movement in the 1920s that was based on a fascination with movement, technology, and machinery.

==Postmodernism==
Postmodern artist Barbara Kruger is known for critical images inspired by commercial advertising.  She is the author of several books. &quot;Love for Sale&quot; shows Kruger's blown up photographic black and white images with text in a red box superimposed creating a new meaning for the viewer.  Kruger taught at the Art Institute and Cal Arts during the 70s. Kruger's work often focuses on feminist issues.  Kruger's Whitney Biennial 2'x3' work, enlarged as she tackled billboards in the US and other countries.
She was the subject of a lecture given at the 3rd Annual Conference of the Society of the Word and Image at Carleton University in Ontario, Canada in 1993.

==Abstract Expressionism==
A school of painting that flourished after World War II until the early 1960s, characterized by the view that art is nonrepresentational and chiefly improvisational.

Abstract art is defined as art that has no reference to any figurative reality. In its wider definition the term describes art that depicts real forms in a simplified or rather reduced way - keeping only an allusion of the original natural subject. The abstract paintings of Joan Miró are a good example of this wider definition. The term non-figurative is used as a synonym.



In the twentieth century Wassily Kandinsky is considered as the inventor of non-figurative art. Over a period of several years his paintings moved gradually away from figurative subjects. In 1910 he created the first completely abstract work of art - a watercolor - without any reference to reality. Wassily Kandinsky not only became the first abstract artist, he also promoted it as a theorist. In 1912 his book On the Spiritual in Art was published.

A movement of abstract painting that emerged in New York City during the mid-1940s and attained singular prominence in American art in the following decade; also called action painting and the New York school. Jackson Pollock 's turbulent yet elegant abstract paintings, which were created by spattering paint on huge canvases placed on the floor, brought abstract expressionism before a hostile public. Willem de Kooning 's first one-man show in 1948 established him as a highly influential artist. Other important artists involved with the movement included Hans Hofmann , Robert Motherwell , and Mark Rothko ; among other major abstract expressionists were such painters as Clyfford Still , Theodoros Stamos, Adolph Gottlieb, Helen Frankenthaler, Lee Krasner, and Esteban Vicente.

== Wiederholung ==
Lesson 10 is a review (''Wiederholung'') lesson to summarize the German language lessons presented in Lessons 6 through 9. You should, as well, return to [[German/Lesson_6|Lektion 6]] and review (that is, completely reread) each of the four lessons back up to this point.  For a more advanced course, you should now incorporate each of the advanced lessons into this &quot;review&quot; process.  That is: review Lesson 6, then do Lesson 6A, review Lesson 7, then do Lesson 7A, etc. If the advanced lessons have already been completed, then now review lessons in the order 6 -&gt; 6A -&gt; 7 -&gt; 7A -&gt; 8, etc.
----
== Verb Conjugation ==
You have learned that there is a relationship between the subject of a verb and the form that verb takes in German.  Some verbs follow a predictable regular pattern, while others are less predictable (irregular verbs). 

 verb:                ''können'' (can)          ''gehen'' (go)         ''sein'' (to be)
 
 pronoun              verb I (irreg.)       verb II            verb III (irregular)
 Basicform            können                gehen              sein
 ich                  kann                  gehe               bin
 du                   kannst                gehst              bist
 er/sie/es            kann                  geht               ist
 wir                  können                gehen              sind
 ihr                  könnt                 geht               seid
 sie                  können                gehen              sind
 Sie (formal)         können                gehen              sind

As you can see, any verb uses the same declination for wir, sie and Sie.
Also, er/sie/es uses the same declination for all three genders.

An eighteenth-century European style, originating in France. In reaction to the grandeur and massiveness of the baroque, rococo employed refined, elegant, highly decorative forms. Fragonard worked in this style.

'''Romanesque''' 
A European style developed in France in the late eleventh century. Its sculpture is ornamental, stylized and complex. Some Romanesque frescoes survive, painted in a monumental, active manner.

'''romanticism''' 
A European movement of the late eighteenth to mid nineteenth century. In reaction to neoclassicism, it focused on emotion over reason, and on spontaneous expression. The subject matter was invested with drama and usually painted energetically in brilliant colors. Delacroix, Gericault, Turner, and Blake were Romantic artists.

'''suprematism''' 
A Russian abstract movement originated by Malevich c. 1913. It was characterized by flat geometric shapes on plain backgrounds and emphasized the spiritual qualities of pure form.

'''surrealism''' 
A movement of the 1920s and 1930s that began in France. It explored the unconscious, often using images from dreams. It used spontaneous techniques and featured unexpected juxtapositions of objects. Magritte, Dali, Miro, and Ernst painted surrealist works.

'''symbolism''' 
A painting movement that flourished in France in the 1880s and 1890s in which subject matter was suggested rather than directly presented. It featured decorative, stylized, and evocative images.

This page is meant to introduce art. Art is a very abstract concept, 
and as such, it makes writing a book on the topic very difficult. 
Even more difficult is the introduction to such a book. So to start 
off, it is ''very'' important to discuss what this book plans to
accomplish, and what it does ''not'' plan to accomplish.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What this book '''will''' do:

Lebanese Cuisine consists of a variety of fresh vegetarian recipes, salads and stews all seasoned with a flavoursome combination of herbs and spices. One of the most widely recognised Lebanese specialties is called Maza, also written &quot;Mezze&quot;, which is a selection of appetizers: olives, cheeses, Labanee, or small portions also known as muqabbilat (starters).

The cuisine of Lebanon includes an abundance of starches, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish and seafood; animal fats are consumed sparingly. Poultry is eaten more often than red meat, and when red meat is eaten it is usually lamb. The cuisine also includes copious amounts of garlic and olive oil, often seasoned by lemon juice - nary a meal goes by in Lebanon that does not include these ingredients. Most often foods are either grilled, baked or sauted in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw or pickled as well as cooked. While the cuisine of Lebanon doesn't boast an entire repertoire of sauces, it focuses on herbs, spices and the freshness of ingredients; the assortment of dishes and combinations are almost limitless. The meals are full of robust, earthy flavors and, like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons.

Cookbook recipe for '''Garlic Lemon Chicken'''.

== Ingredients ==

* For the Chicken
** 4 x Skin-on, boned [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] breasts
** 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|Lemons]] completely juiced (use fresh lemons!)
** 6 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
** 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]
** 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|Pepper]]
** 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Basil|Basil]]
** ¼ tsp [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|Cayenne Pepper]]
** 6 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] sliced in ¼&quot; slices

* For the '[[Cookbook:Toum|toom]]' (Arabic for garlic)
** 4 cloves of garlic
** ½ cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
** ¼ cup [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
** ¼ tsp salt
** a dash of cayenne.

== Procedure ==
# Blend the lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, basil and cayenne pepper to make the marinade. 
# Put the chicken breasts in a deep pan and pour the marinade over it
# Cover and sit all night.  In the morning, flip the chicken to the other side.
# At noon drain the liquid from the pan and cook in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 10-15 minutes (not to cook, only to brown)
# Once finished, pour the marinade over the browned chicken, tightly cover the pan with tin foil (don't burn your fingers) and put back in the oven.  Set the oven to 250°F (120°C)
# Baste at 1pm, 2pm and 3pm.
# At 4pm, add the sliced potatoes to the pot, baste everything, and recover with tin foil.
# Put back in the oven for another hour.
# Once the above step is finished, blend all of the ingredients for the toom together.

At 5pm, dinner's ready.

The trick is not in complicated ingredients - it is the slow cooking and lemon/garlic marinade.  

Use the toom as a condiment for the chicken and potatoes.

Serve with warm pita bread.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Wikipedia:Krebs cycle|Krebs Cycle]] is also known as the [[Wikipedia:Citric acid cycle|Citric Acid Cycle]] or Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle and occurs within the Matrix of the Mitocondria.

'''Acetyl-Coenzyme A''' produced from the Link Reaction is synthesised into '''Citric Acid''' by the action of citrate synthase and its combination with '''Oxaloacetate'''. The citric acid, known as '''Citrate''' in its ionised form is then converted into '''Isocitrate''' by aconitase. This is then converted to '''Alpha-Ketoglutarate''' by citrate dehydrogenase in an oxidative decarboxylation reaction, in which one molecule of CO2 is given off and one molecule of NAD+ is oxidised to NADH. Another oxidative deecarboxylation converts the alpha-ketoglutarate to '''Succinyl Coenzyme A''' with the addition of CoA-SH and again the loss of a CO2 and the oxidation of NAD+ is seen. Succinyl CoA is then converted into '''Succinate''' by the action of Succinyl CoA Synthetase, the addition of water, the loss of CoA-SH and the substrate level phosphorylation of one molecule of ADP to ATP. Succinate is then converted to '''Fumarate''' by Succinate Dehydrogenase, a dehydrogenation reaction which results in the reduction of FADH+ to FADH2. Fumarate is, in turn, hydrated by the addition of one water molecule by Fumarase to '''Malate''' which is finally converted back to '''Oxaloacetate''' by Malate Dehydrogenase in a dehydrogenation reaction that oxidises one NAD+ to NADH. The cycle can then begin again.

There are many products of, and substrates for the Krebs cycle: for instance, amino acids can be metabolised to or catabolised from '''Acetyl CoA, Alpha-Ketoglutarate, Succinyl CoA, Malate''' and '''Oxaloacetate''', depending which specific amino acid. '''Pyruvate''' can be re-synthesised by Pyruvate carboxylase from '''Oxaloacetate''', which can either replenish the Krebs Cycle or make glucose by '''Gluconeogenesis'''. '''Citrate''' can be used for fatty acid (fat) or cholesterol synthesis. '''Succinyl CoA''' can be used to make Haem for Red Blood Cells.

NADH and FADH2 are then used in the '''electron transport chain''' in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Net gain for the Krebs Cycle:
2 Carbon Dioxide, 1 ATP, 3 NADH, and 1 FADH2 '''per molecule of Acetyl CoA'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Translation Phase of Genetic Expression is divided into 2 Steps Transcription and Translation.  During Transcription RNA Polymerase unzips the two halfs of the DNA where it needs to transcript.  Then free RNA bases Attach to the DNA bases with the Polymerase starting at the promoter and ending at the Termination signal.  From this the RNA can become mRNA, rRNA, or tRNA.  The mRNA is a ribbon like strand that takes the genetic information from the nucleus of the cell to the ribosome.  rRNA forms a globular ball that attaches to the rough E.R. to help make ribosomes.  finally the tRNA forms a hair shaped landing base that reads the genetic information to make proteins.  Translation happens when mRNA is pulled through a ribosome and tRNA reads the RNA bases on the mRNA to make anti-codons of 3 bases and brings amino-acids to form the protein.  This starts with the condon AUG and ends at UAG.  When done the protein forms the correct shape and does the task it was created for.  This brings the genetic code from the nucleus, which it never leaves, to the cytoplasm of the cell where proteins are produced to upkeep the body.

==Teaching how to read and write Marathi?==

I would really like to see lessons teaching how to read and write Devanagari for Marathi step-by-step. It's hard to learn from an overview of letters. Lack of examples is another problem, but even if there were examples afterwards the learning situation would be far from perfect because the student would still have to memorise all letters at once in order to be able to begin practising. 

What I have found really useful when learning non-Latin alphabets is a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; method that introduces few letters at a time and offers example words for practise immediately after each letter / each set of letters. What's even better is if those example words are understandable without prior knowledge of the language, that is, international words. For example: names of countries, cities or famous people (if their name isn't significantly different in Marathi than in English), common personal names, Marathi words that have entered English, English words that are used in Marathi, words that both Marathi and English have derived from Greek or Latin...  The advantage of using these words is that students will be able to quickly see their own progress and the whole learning process becomes as fascinating as solving a puzzle. See the &quot;Read Write and Pronounce Greek&quot; lessons in the [[Modern Greek]] Wikibook for an example, or [http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/alphabet.html this external page on Cyrillic]. 

If you'd like to try this approach for teaching how to write Marathi, I'd be glad to help you, even though I don't know it yet (I'd learn it though and I have learned a variety of foreign alphabets already). Just create a big list of suitable words on a planning page like [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]], answer me here and I'll try to find an optimal order for letters. 

Thanks for your efforts to teach a language that is hard to find in European schools!

P.S.: If there's somebody generally unsure about how to create good language lessons, I really recommend reading the following two pages about it: [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] and [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks/Bite-sized language lessons]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bacteria are prokaryotic, unicellular organisms.  Bacteria are very small; so much so that 1 billion could fit on 1 square centimeter of space on the human gums, and 1 gram of digested food has 10 billion bacteria.  Bacteria are the simplest living organisms. Previously they fell under the Kingdom Moneran, but now they fall into two different Domains: Archaebacteria and Eubacteria.  There are several differences between the two.  Typically, microbiologists in the 21st century call these groups &quot;Archaea&quot; and &quot;Bacteria.&quot;  One of the co-discoverers of the three Domains has argued that the term &quot;prokaryote&quot; should be removed from classrooms because it reflects an evolutionary hypothesis that has been disproved, given that the Archaea are more closely related to the Eukarya than they are to the Bacteria (Pace 2006, &lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt; 441 p. 289).

It is incorrect to think of bacteria as particularly &quot;simplistic&quot; for all that they do not have internal organelles that can be visualized using a light microscope.  The bacterial nucleoid, for example, is a highly organized structure even though it typically contains just one or two circular chromosomes with a total of millions of basepairs of DNA (Thanbichier et el., 2005, &lt;u&gt;J Cell. Biochem.&lt;/u&gt; 96:506-521; see also http://www.microbelibrary.org/Laboratory%20Diagnostics/details.asp?id=782&amp;Lang=English).  Bacteria have complex cell walls exterior to the cell membrane.  Some bacteria contain plasmids, which are typically circular DNA with replication that is uncoupled from binary fission (cellular division).  Plasmids in nature often encode traits of significant interest to humans, such as the ability to be resistant to clinically important antibiotics, or the ability to degrade &quot;odd&quot; carbon sources such as TNT or human-made pollutants.  Plasmids from'' Escherichia coli'' have been &quot;domesticated&quot; and have long been in use for genetic engineering, as it is easier to isolate and modify plasmid DNA, and introduce it into a new cells, than it is to modify a bacterial chromosome (see &quot;Techniques&quot; at dnai.org; see also http://www.microbelibrary.org/Laboratory%20Diagnostics/details.asp?id=707&amp;Lang=English).   A few phylogenetic groups of bacteria can make endospores, which are metabolically inert but are able to resist high temperatures, radiation, and desiccation (see http://www.microbelibrary.org/Laboratory%20Diagnostics/details.asp?id=2511&amp;Lang=English).  

Bacterial reproduction is always asexual and usually occurs through binary fusion, once thought to be a simple process of growing and dividing.   Microbiologists now know, however, that binary fission is complex in that it requires dozens of proteins cooperating to build the septum (new cell wall between 'daughter' cells) and to actively separate the two daughter chromosomes.  Furthermore, there are other forms of reproduction in bacteria, all of them &quot;asexual&quot; in that they do not use gametes or involve genetic exchange (Angert 2005, &lt;u&gt;Nature Reviews Microbiology&lt;/u&gt; 3:214-224).  Genetic exchange in bacteria is instead called horizontal (or lateral) gene transfer, because bacteria can obtain genetic information from organisms that are not their parents (Amabile-Cuevas 2003, American Scientist 91:138-149). (Vertical genetic transmission is the inheritance of DNA down through the generations.)  Horizontal gene transfer can happen any time and has nothing to do with cell division.  There are three main types, conjugation which is the sharing of plasmid DNA; transduction, where a bacterial virus accidentally transfers bacterial DNA from one bacterium to another, and transformation, where bacteria bind to DNA in the environment, internalize it, and can use that DNA as genetic material.

==Archaea==

Archaea are microbes that are more closely related to Eukaryotic cells than they are to the Bacteria (http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/aboutoverview.html).  Under a light microscope, they visually resemble Bacteria, so that it wasn't until the advent of the use of molecular methods in evolutionary biology that they were recognized as belonging to their own Domain (a phylogenetic grouping above the level of Kingdom).  Archaea have ultrastructural features that are superficially similar to those in Bacteria but are usually comprised of distinctive molecules. They do, for example, have a cell wall, yet that cell wall never contains peptidoglycan.  Instead, peptidoglycan is a unique molecular signature of the Bacteria.  Archaea also have odd lipids in their cell membranes.  They were originally discovered living in extreme environments thought to resemble conditions on early earth, but now that microbiologists have become more adept at detecting them, it is clear that the Archaea are not confined to extreme habitats and can instead be found everywhere.   It is true that some Archaea are &quot;extremophiles,&quot; found in extremely salty or hot environments, but there are also extremophile Bacteria and even some very unusual extremophile Eukarya.  The best-understood groups of Archaea are:
# ''Methanogens'' use Carbon dioxide and Hydrogen to make Methane. They are found in sewage, cows, and swamps, and they do not take in oxygen.  
# ''Extreme Halophiles'' live in extremely salty places (i.e.:  the dead sea and great salt lake).
# ''Thermoacidophiles'' prefer extremely hot, acidic areas (i.e.:  hot springs and volcanos).

==Bacteria==

(sometimes called &quot;eubacteria&quot;)

Bacteria have peptidoglycan in their cell walls, and they have no unusual phospholipids.  Bacteria have four shapes: 
* bacilli (rod shaped)
* vibrios (curved shaped)
* coccus (round shaped)
* spirilli (spiral shaped).

Bacteria can also have prefixes before their names: strepto, indicating chains of the shaped bacteria, and staphylo, indicating clusters of the shaped bacteria.  A 19th century microbiologist invented the Gram stain, still used today to differentiate bacteria into two types, Gram negative and Gram positive (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Gram).  These types are not useful in determining phylogeny but can be very useful in a clinical setting, because Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria can exhibit differential sensitivity to some classes of antibiotics.  There are probably dozens of &quot;Kingdoms&quot; within the Domain Bacteria, but the phylogeny of Bacteria is still disputed as microbiologists continue to study the evolution of bacteria using molecular methods.   Some of the major types of Bacteria are: 
# Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophs that strip electrons from water and use them to fix carbon dioxide; they are a major source of organic carbon in marine ecosystems.
# Spirochetes are Gram negative bacteria that have flexible cells and internal flagella in an unusual form of a more typical Gram negative cell wall.
# Proteobacteria (E-coli)

Some bacteria produce virulence factors that can cause sickness.  Some examples of these are serotoxins, which are given off by the Gram positive bacteria, and endotoxins, which are given off by Gram negative bacteria as they die.  There are many other examples, however, and specific pathogens make a unique suite of virulence factors that lead to the particular disease caused by that pathogen.

==Introduction==
Our word for economy came from word roots that mean literally &quot;household management.&quot; Today the word refers to all goods and services that an entire community produces. But there's another way in which we use the word-- for example in the phrase &quot;it's more economical for me to ride my bike.&quot; This more common usage typically refers to either saving money or time. We claim is that these uses of the term are identical: At heart, ''economics is the study concerned with the proper allocation of limited resources''.

Wether you support socialism, capitalism, anarcho-syndicalism, or self-sustaining tribal communities you cannot get around the need for an economy: unless we can live off an ecology so suited to us that whatever we want can be plucked from the trees we'll have to make decisions about how to allocate the resources available to us to best suit our needs. Political issues arise when people have different ideas as to what really is &quot;best&quot; for our needs, and who decides, and what groups should be given what resources.

==Currency and the Division of Labor==
Many people naturally think of money after hearing the word economics, but our primary concern in this book is not with money, nor is the field of economics primarily concerned with money. However, as an example of the allocation of goods, currency systems are a good place to start, as most people easily understand the advantages of having a currency.

The use of currencies in society to enable efficient trade is a relatively old idea and has evolved over many centuries: currencies are a human invention that wasn't ever planned nor designed. Instead, it was something that came into use through accident, much like the spoken languages we use. That currencies are so useful explains why they have survived through many different forms and that their adoption has spread.

Money is useful because it creates a universal trading &quot;good&quot; that can be used to purchase almost anything that is tradable, whether it's a food item that might spoil in a couple of days, a sturdy home appliance, clothes that are just the right size, or payment to a neighbor's teenager for mowing your lawn. If we received payment in fruit, this would be excessively less useful for us, because we would either have to consume the fruit, or trade it for something else, before it over-ripened. Instead of playing a scavenger hunt where we trade fruit for spices, spices for blenders, and blenders for jogging suits, we can directly go to sellers of jogging suits and pay with money.

In some sense, money doesn't really exist: It's just something backed up by our government as suitable for payments of debts between people, or public or private entities. In the United States, the dollar is only legal tender for debts that are already owed: For example, it's legal for a bus system to accept payment only in non-dollar tokens, or for a hair stylist to only accept payment in massage. The legal tender aspect of the dollar only comes in when it's for a debt already owed: If the hair stylist gives you a hair cut anyway but you back out on the massage deal, she can take you to court, but the court would allow you to pay in dollars instead. It's requirements like this that give the dollar its legitimacy and thus culture accepts this form of wealth, even though it doesn't exist.

Not every time is using currency actually the most efficient means of trade. For example, you might have a home recording system that is high quality, but you can't sell it for enough dollars to get the used car you want, while your friend is ready to start a band and just got a new car as a gift. It might be more efficient for the two of you to trade the recording system and his old car rather than sell them to a wider market (which would require advertising) or a middleman (who would charge a fee for the service). Nevertheless, when it comes to goods that spoil or services that can only be experienced once (like getting a haircut) it's usually better to use some form of currency as a means of later acquiring specific wealth. Further, it can be rare to find perfect trades so easily.

[TODO: stuff on the division of labor: allows more productive people to do X instead of everyone needing to do it, and that implies economies of scale]

==Wealth and Capital==
Now that we've got the topic of money out of the way, we can actually start talking about wealth. Wealth is simply something that is valuable to someone. There are many different kinds of wealth: the natural resources of the earth, and the great sunset views, are a type of wealth that exists without human creation. In fact, human creation can actually ruin some of this natural wealth by making views or skies less pleasant to look at through pollution or intrusive construction.

Other forms of wealth are created by taking raw materials of a lesser value and transforming them into goods that are more valuable. For example, you might not think much of a hunk of metal and plastic given to you, although you might value a portable audio player made of the same materials. Still other forms of wealth are a little more abstract: the biological diversity of the world is wealth that is a means of taking sunlight that pours onto the earth (something we get for free), molecules from the air and trace elements from the soil and uses photosynthesis to turn them into something that nourishes our bodies (for example, the wealth of the DNA encoded in seeds that, when planted, turn into tomato plants). Other abstract forms of wealth include the works of Shakespeare and folk songs: the simple arraignment of words or tones is something that is valuable to us. A world with 8 billion DVDs of a single Adam Sandler film isn't worth as much as a world with only 1 billion DVDs but which include all of the works of Hitchcock, Kubrick, Kieslowski, and even Mr. Sandler.

Yet another form of wealth is a contract: contracts may be broken, but the legal enforcement behind contracts make them valuable and are something that people want to buy. For example, a band might be interested in buying a contract that lets them perform at a venue on a given night, even though the sheet of paper itself has very little value, and even though the contract doesn't provide for contingencies if the venue burned down before the play date. Sometimes what's valuable to us only has a high probability, but not a certainty, of being useful to us.

We now consider wealth's relationship to capital. First, think of an acre of forest: it has some trees, some rocks and minerals, and some areas with high hay grass. Now suppose a hard working woman named Alice comes to this acre and makes some tools from the rocks and trees and starts cutting down the high hay to make usable lawn, cuts down only as much trees as needed to make a two-bedroom home, and then starts to make bedding and musical instruments with the remaining resources. Even though it started with the same resources, the acre now is worth more than it was before. (Or, at least, it's worth more to Alice.) There are actually two kinds of wealth in this story: the value of the natural resources, and the higher degree of wealth they became. and the wealth inside of Alice's head. Alice's wealth is known by economists as human capital.

The term capital simply means the &quot;means of production.&quot; While Alice's arms and legs were also part of the means of production, none of the wealth would have been produced were it not for her human capital. Alice then created further capital by making the tools that she used to cut and build more things. When she gets around to building a weaving loom, she'll have even more capital.

We refer to some business as being capital intensive when they require large amounts of capital to be run. For example, starting your own printing press business requires an enormous investment in machinery and the infrastructure required to store, run, and maintain it. Other businesses, such as being a real estate agent, only require modest office space, licenses, and a car. It is important to understand the role capital plays in an economy, because capital is how we can create more wealth.

Over time, innovation has made it so that we are more productive at creating more wealth. For example, 200 years ago the majority of the population worked as farmers. We have become so much more effective at farming, primarily through gains from the industrial revolution, that a small minority of the population are farmers today. The industrial revolution, and now the information age, has shrunk the amount of hard labor required. Some people still have back breaking work, but our advances in technology have freed up many more people to have service-based jobs.

To some, a service-based job doesn't feel as &quot;real&quot; as a manufacturing job: i.e., one that creates a good that can be traded. But given that most of the US economy is based on service jobs, it's hard to say they aren't useful. Service jobs are much more than just office administration, and waiting on tables. Service jobs are held by teachers, coaches or other trainers; all forms of entertainers, including athletes, actors, commedians, disc jockeys, and musicians; lawyers and paralegals; health professionals, healers, veterinarians and massage therapists; software developers and hardware designers; architects; translators; tourist guides; clerks and other retailers; all managers; food service workers; taxi cab drivers, and bus drivers; and day care workers. The list could go on, but the short message is that people providing services to other people is something people find to be very valuable.

we'll return later to Marxism and capitalism, but the key point here is that Marxism and capitalism primarily disagree as to who should own capital and how it should be organized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Ruby Programming/TopNav|prev=Interactive Ruby|next=Strings}}
The classic [[w:&quot;Hello, world!&quot; program|Hello, world!]] program is a good way to get started with Ruby.

== Hello, world! ==
Create a text file called &lt;code&gt;hello_world.rb&lt;/code&gt; containing the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'Hello, world!'
&lt;/source&gt;

Now run it at the shell prompt.

 $ '''ruby hello_world.rb'''
 Hello, world!

You can also run the short &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program without creating a text file at all. This is called a [[w:One-liner program|one-liner]].

 $ '''ruby -e &quot;puts 'Hello world'&quot;'''
 Hello, world!

Option &lt;code&gt;-e&lt;/code&gt; means evaluate (Ruby code). You can run this code with [[../Interactive Ruby/|irb]], but the output will look slightly different. &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; will print out &quot;&lt;code&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, but &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt; will also print out the return value of &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; — which is &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;.

 $ '''irb'''
 &gt;&gt; puts &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
 Hello world
 =&gt; nil

== Comments ==
Like [[w:Perl|Perl]], [[w:Bash|Bash]], and [[w:C Shell|C Shell]], Ruby uses the hash symbol (also called Pound Sign, [[w:number sign|number sign]]) for [[w:comment|comments]]. Everything from the hash to the end of the line is ignored when the program is run by Ruby. For example, here's our &lt;code&gt;hello_world.rb&lt;/code&gt; program with comments.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
# My first Ruby program
# On my way to Ruby fame &amp; fortune!
 
puts 'Hello world'
&lt;/source&gt;

You can append a comment to the end of a line of code, as well. Everything before the hash is treated as normal Ruby code.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
puts 'Hello, world!'  # Print out &quot;Hello world&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also comment several lines at a time:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
=begin
This program will
print &quot;Hello world&quot;.
=end
 
puts 'Hello world'
&lt;/source&gt;

Although block comments can start on the same line as &lt;code&gt;=begin&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;=end&lt;/code&gt; must have its own line.  You cannot insert block comments in the middle of a line of code as you can in [[w:C (programming language)|C]], [[w:C++|C++]], and [[w:Java (programming language)|Java]], although you can have non-comment code on the same line as the &lt;code&gt;=end&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
=begin This program will print 'Hello, world!'
=end puts 'Hello, world!'
&lt;/source&gt;

== Executable Ruby scripts ==
Typing the word &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; each time you run a Ruby script is tedious. To avoid doing this, follow the instructions below.

=== Unix-like operating systems ===
In [[w:Unix-like|Unix-like]] [[w:operating systems|operating systems]] &amp;ndash; such as [[w:Linux|Linux]], [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]], and [[w:Solaris Operating System|Solaris]] &amp;ndash; you will want to mark your Ruby scripts as executable using the &lt;code&gt;[[w:chmod|chmod]]&lt;/code&gt; command. This also works with the [[w:Cygwin|Cygwin]] version of Ruby.

 $ '''chmod +x hello_world.rb'''

You need to do this each time you create a new Ruby script. If you rename a Ruby script, or edit an existing script, you do ''not'' need to run &quot;&lt;code&gt;chmod +x&lt;/code&gt;&quot; again.

Next, add a [[w:shebang line|shebang line]] as the ''very first line'' of your Ruby script. The shebang line is read by the shell to determine what program to use to run the script. This line cannot be preceded by any blank lines or any leading spaces. The new &lt;code&gt;hello_world.rb&lt;/code&gt; program &amp;ndash; with the shebang line &amp;ndash; looks like this:

 #!/usr/bin/ruby
 
 puts 'Hello world'

If your &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; executable is not in the &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory, change the shebang line to point to the correct [[w:path (computing)|path]]. The other common place to find the &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; executable is &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/ruby&lt;/code&gt;.

The shebang line is ignored by Ruby &amp;ndash; since the line begins with a hash, Ruby treats the line as a comment. Hence, you can still run the Ruby script on operating systems such as Windows whose shell does not support shebang lines.

Now, you can run your Ruby script without typing in the word &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt;. However, for security reasons, Unix-like operating systems do not search the current directory for executables unless it happens to be listed in your PATH [[w:environment variable|environment variable]]. So you need to do one of the following:

# Create your Ruby scripts in a directory that is already in your PATH.
# Add the current directory to your PATH (''not recommended'').
# Specify the directory of your script each time you run it.

Most people start with #3. Running an executable Ruby script that is located in the current directory looks like this:

 $ '''./hello_world.rb'''

Once you have completed a script, it's common to create a &lt;code&gt;~/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory, add this to your PATH, and move your completed script here for running on a day-to-day basis. Then, you can run your script like this:

 $ '''hello_world.rb'''

==== Using env ====

If you do not want to hard-code the path to the &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; executable, you can use the &lt;code&gt;[[w:env|env]]&lt;/code&gt; command in the shebang line to search for the &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt; executable in your PATH and execute it. This way, you will not need to change the shebang line on all of your Ruby scripts if you move them to a computer with Ruby installed in a different directory.

 #!/usr/bin/env ruby
 
 puts 'Hello world'

=== Windows ===

If you install the native Windows version of Ruby using the [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ Ruby One-Click Installer], then the installer has setup Windows to automatically recognize your Ruby scripts as executables. Just type the name of the script to run it.

 $ '''hello_world.rb'''
 Hello world

If this does not work, or if you installed Ruby in some other way, follow these steps.

# Log in as an [[w:System administrator|administrator]].
# Run the standard Windows &quot;Command Prompt&quot;, &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt;.
# At the command prompt (''i.e.'' shell prompt), run the following Windows commands. When you run &lt;code&gt;ftype&lt;/code&gt;, change the command-line arguments to correctly point to where you installed the &lt;code&gt;ruby.exe&lt;/code&gt; executable on your computer.

 $ '''assoc .rb=RubyScript'''
 .rb=RubyScript
 
 $ '''ftype RubyScript=&quot;c:\ruby\bin\ruby.exe&quot; &quot;%1&quot; %*'''
 RubyScript=&quot;c:\ruby\bin\ruby.exe&quot; &quot;%1&quot; %*

For more help with these commands, run &quot;&lt;code&gt;help assoc&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;help ftype&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.</text>

&quot;I like the idea of making films about ostensibly absolutely nothing. I like the irrelevant, the tangential, the sidebar excursion to nowhere that suddenly becomes revelatory. That's what all my movies are about. That and the idea that we're in possession of certainty, truth, infallible knowledge, when actually we're just a bunch of apes running around. My films are about people who think they're connected to something, although they're really not.&quot; - *[[wikiquote:Errol Morris|Errol Morris]]

Screenwriting is different from other literary forms. The script is essentially a &quot;blueprint&quot; that will guide the other filmmakers through the production of the film. Often, the final film will differ from what was on the page. These differences can be as small as a few simple dialogue changes, or as large as a complete change in tone, direction, and intent. Accepting this process is key to being a screenwriter who not only writes well, but will work well with the other people involved in the film's production.

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being the blueprint for the film, the script also serves as a way to get that film made in the first place. Based on the strength of your screenplay, budget, talent, and enthusiasm will fall into place. It is the strength of the story that can secure financing and production talent. It's not innovative and thrilling setpieces or even a smattering of really great scenes peppered throughout your script, but a cohesive, intriguing story that holds the reader's (and eventually the viewer's) attention from beginning to end. This is such a basic concept, and yet one that seems utterly lost on some screenwriters, even those already established in Hollywood.

Every script should be written in the industry format. The industry's script format help readers to understand how long the movie is going to be.

The screen writer has to be creative and original and also to be flexible with the script and to adapt it to the budget of the film  
==Finding a Story==

===Write what you Know===

This adage is always &quot;Write what you know&quot;.  This is excellent advice as writing from your personal experience will make the story, characters and tone believable.

The flip side of this is the joke that all first time scripts by writers who have recently moved to Hollywood are about...the struggles of a young writer recently moved to Hollywood.  So write what you know but choose something of interest to an audience.  You would be amazed at how easily a little known hobby of yours or a quirky friend translates into a scene or a character.  Shamelessly mine your personal history and cut and paste characteristics  of your friends together and you will be surprised at how little you need to spin from whole cloth.

The first ten pages of script are said to be the most important. They should begin to show how the entire film will work as a whole.

==The Right Budget==

More often than not, the beginning screenwriter will find that his first sold screenplay will result in low-budget film. This also applies to those writing for the independent film scene.

With that in mind, it may not be a good idea to call for giant six-legged creatures scurrying up the side of a skyscraper or epic space battles across multiple solar systems in your script. While such effects ''can'' be done on a limited budget, they will not be of similar quality to those features for which money is not a constraint. 

It is not only extended special effects sequences that can break a budget, but also a large cast and/or sets. For low-budget films, try to keep both the cast and the different locations as few in number as possible. While this may seem limiting to a writer's creativity, many find the opposite to be true when they are confronted with the challenge of creating a compelling and memorable story within the confines of a low budget.

Of course, if money is not an issue, feel free to create a ''Lawrence of Arabia''-style epic with a cast of thousands and computer-generated graphics that would break [[wikipedia:Industrial Light and Magic|Industrial Light and Magic]].

=Screenwriting Books and Authors=

&lt;p&gt;Screenwriting books come in two forms: those written by successful screenwriters in Hollywood and those by, well, other types of people. And while you may be thinking that you would prefer to read a book on screenwriting by someone who has actually ''sold'' a script, both types of books actually have their strengths and weaknesses.

Successful screenwriters have a certain pedigree to their &quot;how-to&quot; books because they have actually been there and done that. However, success in artistic fields is rarely formulaic. They themselves may be confused as to what it was exactly in their script that allowed them to sell it in the first place. These books tend to be slightly muddled in thought and offer a strong temptation to handle things the way this particular author did (because, after all, he did sell his script). 

While his method may have worked for him, it may not work for you for any number of reasons. These books are worth reading because they do offer a glimpse into the thought-process of a successful screenwriter, along with the usual samples that you can study, but just remember to take their pathway and alter it to fit your writing style and personality.

&lt;p&gt;The other type of screenwriting books usually comes from academia: often from a professor who has never sold a screenplay, but seems to know a lot about the format. These books are useful in learning the mechanics of the screenplay. It is crucial for a first-time writer to remember that all the characterization and pathos in the world cannot help a script that doesn't hold true to the basic foundation of what makes a screenplay a  screenplay in the first place. While it is true that there are plenty of scripts that break convention, knowing the convention is the only way you can break it successfully. The writers of these books can take a more generalized view of the process and focus in on things like act structures, climaxes, and inciting incidents, but rarely offer the advice on making your characters and story come alive. So any good writer will have a library that has at least two books from these two seperate categories.


===Syd Field and Robert Mckee===
&lt;p&gt;These are the two most well known screenwriting &quot;gurus,&quot; though neither has written a successful movie.  This does not mean they have nothing worthwhile to say; both writers are good analysts of structure and form. However, what you won't find in their books is how to put heart and spirit into your story. What is a story without heart and spirit? Lifeless. So get their books, read them, and use them to help you with structure. Just don't take their methods as gospel and don't be afraid to discard what they teach when the time is right.

===William Goldman===

&lt;p&gt;Goldman won an Academy Award for &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, another one for &quot;All the President's Men&quot; and he has written (among others) two famous books on screenwriting, &lt;i&gt;Adventures in The Screen Trade&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;More Adventures in the Screen Trade&lt;/i&gt;. The oft-quoted &quot;nobody knows anything&quot; (meaning you can have all the right elements for a great movie and flop at the box office) is a quote from &quot;Adventures in the Screen Trade&quot;. Although he does not teach structure, as Syd Field or Robert McKee do, he does provide often funny, sometimes heart-breaking insights into the life of a working (striving and surviving) screenwriter in Hollywood. His books are no screenwriting manuals, but the life and heart that are lacking in McKee's or Field's books are abundant in his memoirs. Read McKee once, so you know what people talk about when they mention &quot;inciting incident&quot; and other McKeeisms, but read Goldman every now and then, to be inspired, and know that, as hard as you think writing is for you, it is even harder for him.

===Cherry Potter - &lt;i&gt;Screen Language&lt;/i&gt;===

&lt;p&gt;An excellent counterweight to the more structural and formalistic screenwriting guides. Includes inspiring and original suggestions for approaching the process of generating and elaborating story ideas. Also contains insightful analyses of a number of classic films, concentrating on the sequence (a series of scenes) as an essential building block.

===J. Michael Straczynski - &lt;i&gt;The Complete Book of Scriptwriting&lt;/i&gt;===

&lt;p&gt;The Creator of the Emmy-winning series Babylon Five (as well as other credits too numerous to mention), J. Michael Straczynski provides a notable tome that marries insider experience with practical tips for outlining, writing, finding an agent, pitching and more. While his topic is broad (with sections on writing for movies, television, animation, radio, theatre and the business itself) his grasp and the script examples alone make it a worthy read. Producing between 2000 and 3000 pages of published or produced material every year, authors don't get much more credible than this.

===Elliot Grove - &lt;i&gt;Write and Sell the Hot Screenplay&lt;/i&gt;===

&lt;p&gt;From the director of Raindance, this book presents a down-to-earth, systematic approach to all the elements of writing a screenplay, plus a detailed strategy for selling it once it’s written. It covers a lot of ground and is therefore inevitably concise, but the clarity of the concepts and practical advice is hugely valuable. Elliot Grove regularly presents a two-day workshop of the same name, which is well worth attending

===Stephen King===

Okay, so he's not a screenwriter. He is, however, one of the best-selling authors of all time, so anything he has to say about writing is probably worth listening to.  King's book &lt;i&gt;On Writing&lt;/i&gt; is excellent as he tries to come to grips with what causes us to create and looks at from where the writing comes.  Anybody doing any sort of writing will find this book most useful.

=Screenwriting Websites=

==What is an &quot;Element&quot;==

Remember that seventies band [[Wikipedia:Earth, Wind &amp; Fire|Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]]? Actually, in film parlance, an element is not one of the four classical elements - nor one of the 101 modern elements. It is, instead, a well-known cast or crew member.  Jude Law is an element, as is Yuen Woo-ping, the famed fight director.  

If you have an element, studios and independent investors are inclined to give you money. You will get more money if you have signed Jude Law than if you have signed Yuen Woo-Ping, but both are enough to make your project a &quot;go.&quot;

== How to get an Element ==

! style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | The Harvey Keitel Part
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#ffffce;&quot; | 

This phrase was coined by Affleck and Damon and the method was explained by Peter Biskind in his great book 'Down and Dirty Pictures' and expanded upon during the launch of this book in the UK.  Here's Peter:

&quot;You really have to have a good script and a fairly bankable star attached, just like Jack Nicholson in 'About Schmidt'. That's a little bit of an exaggeration. The paradigmatic story, I think, is the way Matt Damon and Ben Affleck went about getting financing for 'Good Will Hunting' they knew the story of Quentin Tarantino attracting Harvey Keitel for 'Reservoir Dogs' and Harvey Keitel being the key factor getting Live Entertainment to finance the film for $1 million. So they wrote what became the Robin Williams part and they used it in 'Good Will Hunting' and used to refer it as the &quot;Harvey Keitel part&quot;.

That's what they did. They wrote a very self-contained part that a major actor could do in a week so it wouldn't interfere with his or her schedule, and they gave - I think Robin Williams got 30% of the gross for doing that tiny part. They got their deal based on the script and when Miramax got hold of it, they started to do what they often do which is the film went nowhere. But when Robin Williams committed to that role, it got made in a minute.&quot;

So the key to attracting a big star for a small film is to write a self contained part which you can shoot in one location in under a week.  This they can easily fit into their schedule and so it becomes attractive to them.

|}
First, you need to decide who would be great for your part.  A small part for a crotchety grandfather who used to be a cop? Try Clint Eastwood. Once you have decided who you want, you need to attempt to contact them.  Direct contact is always best; if you know anyone who knows them, or if you can arrange to bump into them, take these options.  If direct contact is not possible, make contact with their agent or manager.  Here are some resources for finding managers or agents.

== Types of microphone ==
* Dynamic: Most common / cheapest. Dynamic Microphones have a metal coil within a thin plastic diaphragm which vibrates beside a fixed-charge magnet, generating a voltage.  These microphones do not require an external power source.
* Condenser: Most require Phantom Power. Known for producing more detail, especially in the upper frequencies. Condenser microphones use one fixed and one movable electromagnetic plate, the vibration of which generates a voltage.  These mics require external power to charge the electromagnets. 
* Shotgun: A subtype of condenser mic that is used in filmmaking to catch dialogue during filming.  Shotgun mics are generally designs which use a long, notched barrel to increase side and rear rejection, picking up more sound from the front of mic.
* Ribbon: Ribbon Microphones use a thin charged ribbon beside a charged magnetic plate to generate a voltage.  Was rare, becoming more common. Catching speed as being 'smooth' on guitars. These mics require external power to charge the electromagnets. 
* Also: Mic Patterns
   * Omnidirectional: pickup sound in a circle around the mic
   * Cardioid: pickup sound better directly in front of the mic, less sound pickup as you move around the sides of the mic

== Electronics you should be aware of ==
=== Balanced versus unbalanced ===
Balanced audio connections use 3 wires for sending each channel: a positive phase, a negative phase, and a ground.  The sending device sends its output over both the plus phase and the negative phase.  But (and here's the clever bit) the signal is inverted on the negative phase.  The receiving device then inverts the negative phase back (to match the positive phase) and adds it to the positive phase.  Any noise picked up along a stretch of wire will be out of phase with itself, (once the destination reverts the negative phase) and be cancelled out.

=== Grounding ===

=== Shielding ===

=== Phantom power ===
Phantom power is used for condenser microphones that need power to run.  It is also used to power direct boxes.  Direct boxes turn unbalanced signal into balanced signal for reducing and preventing hum.  You will most often see phantom power in 48v.  You can get phantom power from a source such as many sound consoles, especially if you have a recording console.  If you don't have it built into your console, you can buy a portable unit that takes up an outlet and has an xlr in and xlr out(with 48v power).

== Boom technique ==
* http://www.filmunderground.com/77/Article/NWFS/Boom%20Techniques.htm

== Mixing ==
As a quick rule of thumb for a TV mix, dialogue should average 3.5/4 ppm on a meter i.e. around -20/-18dB. You should record it like this 
and mix at these levels. Peak dialogue shouts etc shouldn't really go above 6 ppm (-10dB). If you are recording or mixing for TV nothing 
should peak over 7ppm (-6dB). And those peaks should last a minimal amount of time. Music is mixed at the dubbing mixer's discretion, so 
that it works with the programme and fits with the dialogue, but shouldn't peak above 6.5ppm. A limiter would usually be placed across 
the output to ensure nothing goes above 7ppm.

If you are mixing for DVD or Theatre release you would use the full digital scale. Dialogues should still average -20/-18dB however your fx 
peaks can go the full range to 0dB but not over!

So you would have two mixes one for TV and one for DVD.

the BBC's audio delivery specification states:

&quot;Peak sound levels (when measured on a BS 5428 Peak Programme Meter) within the programme must not exceed PPM 6: that is, no greater than +8dB with respect to the reference level of -18dBFS.&quot;

In other words there should be no less than 10db of 'headroom' between the highest level you can record and your programme's highest peak. 

You can find the full document at:
http://web.archive.org/web/20050312163940/http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/delivering_quality/pdf/tv/tv_standards_london.doc

It is preferable to have sound with &quot;hiss&quot; rather than distortion.  Distortion cannot be fixed, background noise can be somewhat fixed.

== What to record on? ==
=== The video camera ===
I've recorded onto camera quite a few times - the skinny is that you can get great audio from the cameras with XLR inputs and also:

The Canon XL1 does not have phantom power - you need an external mic power supply.

The DVX-100a has small audio controls which are more difficult to manipulate, a little movment seems to make a big difference in level

One of the two DVX100a's I've used had a buzz only when the DV tape was installed. Very annoying, but the other one was quiet.

The Sony PD170 has a good set of audio controls - especially the ch1/ch2 link function when using one microphone (two channels are better than one!)

The PD100 has needs a +48/XLR hot shoe attachment, otherwise it sounds fine.

It's wise to back up audio, and slate scenes without pausing, when using DV cameras - back up on DAT. On a recent 3 camera shoot, I had a total of 6 audio tracks, one into the DVx100a, one into a Canon Optura PI (fine little camera!), but with 1/8&quot; connector and one into a Sony tcd-08 DAT - the DAT won as the best overall sound with the lowest noise and cleanest sound.

DAT-Heads concerns itself with Digital Audio Tape decks, with an emphasis on their use for the recording and distribution of live music.

=== MiniDisk ===
ATRAC 3 is a proprietary lossy perceptual audio codec developed by Sony and used for minidisc and other Sony products such as the PlayStation Portable. Uncompressed PCM offers higher quality, and therefore field recording with a portable DAT or harddisk recorder is almost always preferable to a minidisc recorder. Personally, I'd trust a tape (DAT) more as I have accidentally recorded over material with the minidisk's chapter functions. It's easier to track down ABS (absolute time code) on a DAT, especially for sound logging purposes.
DAT = Digital Audio Tape

=== Hard Disk ===
Hard Disk recording has quickly become the industry standard (aside from analog tape.) Benefits include: Non-linear editing - no need to rewind or fast-forward to find different songs. Cost - You can buy a hard drive with well over a hundred gigs, for around a hundred bucks. 100 gigs can hold 300 hours of uncompressed single-channel audio, making it a very cheap way to record.

=== Portable Devices ===
With the advent of mp3 players, portable audio has become a household convenience. Some devices can be slipped into a pocket or clipped to a belt, but certain recorders are more bulky and cannot be carried as easily. Take this into consideration and make sure you have, if nothing else, long enough audio cables to allow your recordist to move around as he captures sound during your shoots.

== Wild track ==
When on location you should always record a &quot;wild track&quot;.  This should be a few minutes of the ambient noise from your location (the sound of traffic in the distance, birds singing etc).  You should ask the assistant director to tell the entire crew to be quiet so you get an undisturbed track.

Why bother?  In the edit it's very useful (and often absolutely required) to keep a wild track running in the background to smooth over the changes from cut to cut.

A Wild Track is an audio only recording of an actor's lines while the camera is NOT rolling. There are no sync marks or visible slates.  These wild recordings are used to replace dialogue from a filmed take that may be unusable for various reasons. Perhaps a plane flew over during the scene.  The Wild Track Or Wild Line will be used in part or in whole to replace the on-camera dialogue. It is also used for Off-camera lines that need to be recorded on-mic. Many times wild Lines are used to replace compromised recordings made during a Wide master shot where the microphone could not be placed in the optimal position. Because the shot is wide, lip-sync of these lines is not as critical and sync errors are not as visible as for a close up.

&quot;Room Tone&quot; or &quot;Presence&quot; is a wild recording of just the ambient sound of a location (no one speaking). It is used in post production to cover unwanted sounds (like the director's verbal instruction during the take). To record Room tone you should place the same microphone in the same position as it was during the dialogue take. Record at the same level used for the actual take but have everyone remain still and quiet.

Short films are often used as the starting place for new filmmakers, but others use them as an art form unto themselves, allowing the filmmaker far more creative control than he or she would have over a feature.  However, for those wanting to make a feature, it is commonly considered that one should make shorts first. Why is this?

Filmmaking is a skill that can only be learned by practice.  Diving into your first feature before learning your craft on shorts would be like driving your Dad's expensive sports car on the motorway before you'd had any lessons on quiet back-roads.  There has never been an easier time to make a short film.  Everyone owns or knows someone with a video camera.

==Advantages of shorts over features==
*Lower cost
*Less time commitment
*Can take bigger risks
*Good practice for filmmaking skills (almost all directors have made short films at one time or another)
*You can basically do anything you want - there are no censorship restrictions for short films (since there's no real market for them), and you don't need to tell a story in under ten minutes. You can just have an insane barrage of jokes and gags if you wish.

==Disadvantages of shorts==
*You'll never make your money back. It's rare to make any money at all from your short.

==What do you get (possibly)?==
*Publicity if you do well
*Networking
*Experience
*Fun (very important)

===Publicity and Networking===
The first two are maybes. Keep in mind that there are a lot of shorts out there. Don't expect them to come beating down your door just because you made something witty.

===Experience===
It is tough to start out big, and if you do, you can fall flat on your face (and the creditors can become your worst enemies). But, it helps to just try to get out there and shoot something. Taking a look at the outcome of a short piece can teach you a lot about yourself and what you need to improve (and maybe whether you are in the right industry).

===Fun  :)===
A short can be done with a bunch of friends in a week(end), or just some student actors. It can be shot with a cheap few hundred dollar handheld, and you can try out all kinds of things that you might feel a bit nervous about on a bigger budget film. You can take it easy and experiment. It can just be fun. If it isn't fun for you, well perhaps it is best that you only made a short.

The Ukrainian language, like Russian and Belorussian, uses the Cyrillic writing system, but Ukrainian alphabet has quite many differences from the aforementioned languages. Cyrillic alphabet is the modification of Greek alphabet which was used by saint fathers Cyril and Methodius to write sacred texts translated in Old Slavonic language. That is why many letters of the Ukrainian alphabet are similar to the Latin letters (because the Latin alphabet was also based on the Greek one).

There is a special sign in Ukrainian language, the apostrophe (апостроф), that used prior to я, ю, є, ї (ya, yu, ye, yi). For example, подвір'я (paw-dveer-ya), в'юн (v-yun), об'єкт (ob-yekt), під'їзд (pid-yizd). Unlike the hard sign in Russian, it is used much more often in Ukrainian.

== Pronunciation ==

Almost always Ukrainian words are pronounced literally i.e., each letter has fixed pronunciation and is pronounced only in one way, separately from the others. There are a few minimal exceptions, however, - they will be described also.

So the Ukrainian letters are pronounced:

* Consonants:

** '''Б''' - like ''b'' in ''big''
** '''В''' - like ''v'' in ''vote''
** '''Г''' - like ''h'' in ''hood'', also like ''h'' in ''Hamlet''. This h is soft. It is also voiced, unlike in English. 

Sometimes pronounced like a &quot;g&quot; as in &quot;gate&quot;

** '''Ґ''' - like ''g'' in ''go'', ''goose'' 
** '''Д''' - like ''d'' in ''door'', but without aspiration
** '''Ж''' - like ''s'' in ''measure, ''pleasure''
** '''З''' - like ''z'' in ''zoo''
** '''Й''' - like ''y'' in ''play'', ''joy''
** '''К''' - like ''k'' in ''keen''
** '''Л''' - like ''l'' in ''love''
** '''М''' - like ''m'' in ''month''
** '''Н''' - like ''n'' in ''night'' but the tongue touches the teeth, and not the alveoles
** '''П''' - like ''p'' in ''pig''
** '''Р''' - like ''r'' in ''rabbit'', but it's actually a trilled like the Spanish rr in perro
** '''С''' - like ''s'' in ''sing''
** '''Т''' - like ''t'' in ''table'', but without aspiration
** '''Ф''' - like ''f'' in ''fair''
** '''Х''' - like ''h'' but not soft; it is pronounced with the back of the throat and tongue. Often transliterated as 'kh' or 'ch', it's like the &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;Bach&quot;. (But not the 'ch' in German &quot;ich&quot;, which is pronounced further forward in the mouth.) Pronounced like ''j'' in Spanish in &quot;mojado&quot;.
** '''Ц''' - is pronounced like ''ts'' in ''bits''
** '''Ч''' - like ''ch'' in ''chess''
** '''Ш''' - like ''sh'' in ''shore'', ''shook''
** '''Щ''' - is pronounced like two separate sounds: '''ШЧ'''. Consider the sounds the letters 'shch' make in these phrases: &quot;Cash cheque&quot;, &quot;fish chowder&quot;, &quot;reddish cherry&quot;.

There are two sounds in Ukrainian that are represented by two letters:
** '''дз''' - like ''ds'' in ''goods'', ''bids''
** '''дж''' - like ''dg'' in ''hedge'' or the ''j'' in ''jam''

They are pronounced differently from coincidental combinations of the letters ''д'' and ''з'' or ''д'' and ''ж''. (cf. дзвеніти and підземний, бджола and джміль)

Also there is a soft form of most consonants: mild '''Л''' sounds like ''l'' in ''leap'', mild '''Р''' sounds like the second ''r'' in ''carry'' or ''r'' in the Spanish ''arriba'' and so on. '''Ч''' is not always mild like it is in Russian or always hard like in Belorussian, it can be both mild and hard as in ''течія'' or ''чотири'' respectively.

The soft form is called ''palatalization'' where the tongue is moved from its original position. Consider the difference in pronunciation of ''key'' and ''cool''. In ''key'' the /k/ (precided by closed front vowel, the tongue moves up and forward) is palatalized and in ''cool'' the /k/ (labialized, and oral cavity is increased by this) is not. Same thing with ''tea'' and ''tool''. When we talk about soft or mild consonants we are talking about palatalization. Palatized consonants are called soft in Ukrainian.

A pair of identical consonants pronounsed not as a simple consonant and not as two separate sounds, but as long consonant.

* Vowels:
** Simple Vowels:
*** '''А''' - like ''a'' in ''father'' or the second ''a'' in ''apart''
*** '''E''' - like ''e'' in ''echo'', ''edit'', also like ''a'' in ''at''
*** '''І''' - like ''ee&quot; in &quot;meet&quot; and softens the previous consonant
*** '''И''' - like ''y'' in ''myth'' or 'i' in 'big' (near to the Russian sound ''Ы''), it is almost the same as '''І''' but should never be after a soft consonant
*** '''О''' - like ''o'' in &quot;more&quot;, &quot;lore&quot;, &quot;fore&quot;. NOT like &quot;o&quot; in ''obey'', and but never spoken as ''ou''. 
*** '''У''' - like ''oo'' in &quot;moon&quot;.
** Complex Vowels - have their analogs among simple vowels; if a complex vowel follows an hard (not mild) consonant, the consonant becomes mild and the vowel is pronounced as the simple; else first '''Й''' is pronounced, followed by the corresponding simple vowel:
*** '''Я''' -  '''ЙА''' pronounced &quot;ya&quot; a 'y' in front of an 'a' as in ''yard''
*** '''Є''' -  '''ЙЕ''' pronounced &quot;ye&quot; as in ''yes''
*** '''Ї''' -  '''ЙІ''' pronounced &quot;yi&quot; it is never placed after a consonant because ''І'' already palatalizes the consonant automatically
*** '''Ю''' -  '''ЙУ''' pronounced like as in &quot;you&quot;

'''Ь''' is not pronounced, it is called '''м’який знак''' (soft sign) or '''знак м’якшeння''' (sign of softening) and is used to make preceding consonant palatized. For example, in ''замість'' (instead of) the ''т'' is softened. In fact, the ''м'' is also softened by the ''і'' and the ''с'' is also softened by being in front of the soft ''т''

Keep in mind that there is no complex vowel that corresponds to '''О'''. Instead, '''Й''' and '''Ь''' are used together with '''О''' letter: ''його'', ''льодом''. 

Also the apostrophe sign is used after a consonant and before a complex vowel to prevent the consonant from becoming mild. The complex vowel is therefore pronounced like ''й'' and corresponding simple vowel. For example, ''в'язати'' (to tie up) is pronounced like ''вйазати''.

*Some cases of discrepancies between spelling and pronunciation:
**unvoiced consonant + voiced consonant = voiced pair (''боротьба'' is pronounced like ''бородьба''); but voiced consonant + unvoiced consonant or unvoiced consonant + approximant consonant do not change, except:
***'''З''' + unvoiced consonant = '''С''' (''розпис'' is pronounced like ''роспис'');
***'''Г''' + '''К''' or '''Т''' = '''Х''' (''нігті'' is pronounced like ''ніхті'');
**a pair of sibilants converges (''зшити'' is pronounced like ''шшити''; ''стежці'' → ''стезці''; ''дочці'' → ''доцці'').

==Try to Pronounce==

Here are some Ukrainian words. Try to pronounce them keeping in mind the bolded vowels are stressed:

* Рак (''rak''; crayfish) - Pronounce &quot;rruk&quot;, not &quot;rzake&quot;.
* Юрб'''а''' (''yurba''; crowd)
* '''Ї'''жа (''yizha''; food)
* Р'''а'''нок (''ranok''; morning)
* Кол'''и'''-н'''е'''будь (''koly-nebud' ''; somewhen)
* Ядр'''о''' (''yadro''; kernel)
* Слов'''a''' (''slova''; word)
* Ґедзь (''ged'z'''; gadfly) - &quot;Ґ&quot; is pronounced like &quot;g&quot; in &quot;get&quot;. In this word &quot;дз&quot; is palatalized. Touch your tongue to the palate and say &quot;z&quot;.
* Прох'''а'''ння (''prokhannya''; request, wish) - Long and soft &quot;ннь&quot; [-ɲːɑ].
* Б'''у'''ти (buty; to be) - Do not pronounce it &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;и&quot; doesn't sound like [i], slide back a bit.

Ukrainian is written as pronounced just like the other Slavs, but, like Russian and Bulgarian, the stress is very unpredictable and stressing the wrong syllable can lead to misunderstandings. Virtually every textbook and dictionary will write these words with an acute accent (ˊ) on the stressed syllable: юрба́, кість, ра́нок, коли́-небудь, ядро́, слі́дувати, ґедзь, бу́ти. Watch out for words that are written the same, but stressed in a different syllable, such as з'''а'''мок (castle) — зам'''о'''к (lock).

Wings 3D is a free, open source polygon modeler that was originally inspired by Nendo and later Mirai (both by Izware). Once learnt, its clean, no-frills interface and wide-ranging (but unbloated!) toolset lets the user concentrate on their prime purpose - modeling. 

The current release is available from the [http://www.wings3d.com/ Wings 3D site]. Other software is necessary to allow models made in Wings to be (properly) rendered and / or animated, although Wings does have an excellent feature-rich native UV unwrap facility.

Many industry standard import / export options are supported by Wings to allow it to communicate with the 'outside world'

El Martillo-ons y tira -offs es dos técnicas de cerca relacionadas. Se utilizan para jugar ' ' el '' del legato, es decir, de una manera lisa, y también se utilizan para ayudar al guitarist a jugar más rápidamente. Se utilizan lo más comúnmente posible en trabajo de la guitarra eléctrica, pero pueden ser utilizadas en consonancias acústicas como adornos. 
== martillo-en huelga del == 
una E abierta en la primera secuencia. Mientras que la nota todavía está sonando, rápidamente y firmemente presione un dedo en el tercer traste. Si está hecha correctamente, una nota de G debe sonar. Esto se llama &quot;martilleo en&quot; la secuencia. Sin la amplificación eléctrica, martillo-en tiende para hacer el &amp;mdash más reservado sano; ¡mucho más reservado si uno no lo ha practicado! (aunque, porque las secuencias están más cercano al fingerboard, el martillo-ons es más fácil de ejecutarse en una guitarra eléctrica, son utilizadas extensivamente por los guitarists acústicos también.) Martillo-en la lata apenas como juegúese fácilmente con las notas preocupadas: juego justo la nota normalmente y martillo sobre otro traste (alto-numerado) en la misma secuencia. el 
== tira -apagado del == 
tira -apagado es el contrario del martillo-en. Sostenga la secuencia de E en el tercer traste. Pulse la secuencia y, mientras que la nota todavía está sonando, lance el dedo de preocupación. Si está hecho correctamente, el G se debe seguir por una E abierta. Como martillo-en, esto tiende para hacer el sonido más reservado. Para ayudar a aliviar esto, un movimiento oblicuo leve del dedo mientras que el quitar agregará la vibración adicional a la secuencia, preservando el volumen. Es muy duro que un principiante logren, y las ayudas oblicuas del movimiento grandemente. el 
== el trill del == 
A del trill es dos notas que se alternan, tales como una A y se pulsa A #. solamente la primera nota; el resto está rápidamente martillar-en y quitado</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before the common acceptance of the heliocentric model in the mid 1500s, the Earth was believed to be the center of the known universe. Many inherent problems in the geocentric model of the universe led Nicolaus Copernicus to formulate an alternate means by which planets and stars moved. Two such problems are the apparent retrograde motion of various planets, specifically Mars, and the ensuing epicycle theory made to compensate for this issue, as well as the phases of Venus that occur.


== Planetary Motion and Epicycles ==

[[Image:Ptolemy Epicycles.svg|250px|right|thumb|A model of the Ptolemaic model of geocentrism, complete with an epicycle.]]
Viewing Earth as the center of our universe, many of the planets in our solar system take on a peculiar motion across the night sky. For instance, Mars appears to move in a retrograde fashion from time to time. Since the geocentric model holds that all the planets in our solar system orbit the Earth, this would mean that from time to time Mars reverses its orbital direction only to resume it later. The Greek astronomer, Ptolemy, sought to explain this phenomenon with the use of epicycles - that is, small circular motions that planets orbiting the Earth followed on top of their circular orbit around the Earth. Astronomers from Greek times to the Enlightenment compensated for flaws in the geocentric model by adding extra layers of epicycles, until the system was so complex it became virtually unusable. Copernicus' heliocentric model, placing the Sun at the center with planets going around it rather than around the Earth, rid the universe of many of the epicycles that plagued astronomy at that time.

== Phases of Venus ==
[[Image:Phases-of-Venus.svg|thumb|right|250px|As can be seen, the discovery of the full range of phases of Venus by Galileo indicated that the Earth could not be at the center of the universe]]
[[Image:Geocentric_phases_of_Venus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Given the geocentric model, it would be impossible for Venus to be &quot;full&quot; - that is, entirely illuminated. This is one of the factors that convinced Galileo of heliocentrism]]
Another problem with the geocentric model occurred when observing Venus and its relative phases: should Venus and the Sun orbit the Earth, then it would be impossible for Venus to be in the &quot;full&quot; phase, that is complete illumination (similar to a full moon). Thus, the Ptolemaic model predicted only crescent and new phases of Venus. Yet, as Galileo observed, this was clearly not the case; Venus exhibited all phases of the moon, a phenomenon predicted and accounted for by Copernicus' model. Discovered by Galileo, this phenomenon was one of the key factors that would end up supporting the Heliocentric view of the universe.

Note that this is only one of a number of observations made by Galileo that contradicted the ancient beliefs, but this one most directly called into question the idea that planets orbit the Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''GET''' is a reference text for undocumented [[w:HTTP|GET]] arguments available on queryable [[w:WWW|WWW]] pages.

Background:  Web/Html forms are a process which allows users/viewers to Enter information on a web page which will then be sent to the web server for processing.  The most common method for processing is called CGI ( Common Gateway Interface ) and this stipulates how the data will be passed to an external ( from the web server) program and how that program will generate  web page to be displayed back to the user.  The HTML form can specify one of two methods for data to be sent from the webserver, the first is GET which specifies that all information is included in the requested URL.  The second is POST which specifies that additional information will be sent after the URL request.  While there are advantages of both the biggest advantage of GET is that since everything is in the URL the input (and resulting display) can be bookmarked or saved in a link so that the data doesn't need to be re-entered each time.  The biggest advantage of POST is that there isn't a limit on the size of the data which can be passed, so may claim that it also allows data to be passed secretly but that is a fallacy.  What is not necessarily widely known is that since most writers of CGI scripts use libraries to decode the form data and most library writers check for a decode both GET and POST automatically and treat both types the same, you can turn most POST forms into GET requests/links which allow for documented exploration.  HTML forms and GET (and POST) encoding is well documented on the web, and the source code can be easily viewed in most browsers with view source options.

GET arguments are the simplest means of querying a dynamic web page for specific information.  They consist of a simple modification to the base [[w:URL|URL]], beginning with a &quot;?&quot; sign after the filename.  Not all websites provide GET argument interfaces as part of their information portal, but many do.

For example, the [[w:Google|Google]] web interface can be queried directly by URL.  If you wish to search Google for &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, you can simply type the following directly into your address bar: http://www.google.com/search?q=Wikipedia

Everything after the &quot;?&quot; is the GET argument, which tells the Google server what you are interested in.  If you are unfamiliar with this, try experimenting by changing the text after the &quot;q=&quot; in the above URL.

Knowing GET arguments can be useful for everyday browsing, but are also a lot of fun for [[w:hacker|hacker]]s (mostly the harmless type) to play with in writing computer scripts.  Most web pages that allow GET queries do not, however, provide any documentation of the available parameters.  In the Google URL above, it is easy to determine that the &quot;q=&quot; string indicates your &quot;query&quot; and whatever follows it is what Google looks up.  The arguments are not always easy to decipher, however.

The idea of the '''GET''' Wikibook is to allow hacker types who have bothered to decipher cryptic GET strings to share their discoveries.

I'm Polish so I've fixed small mistake - locativ of 'piwo' (beer) is 'piwie', not 'piwu'. Simmilar 'słowo' - locativ 'słowie' (word), 'paliwo' - locativ 'paliwie' (gasoline).

Okay, you've decided on some sounds that you want to use in your language, on a way to write the sounds, and on what sounds can go where; now it's time to start word-building.

== Morphology ==

Word building isn't as simple as picking a word from the dictionary and making up a pattern of sounds (don't worry, it's not as boring either).  If you look in an English dictionary you will find many words that can be broken up into smaller words.  For example, the word '''everybody''' can be split into the two words '''every''' and '''body'''.  Even more often, you will find words that can be broken up into pieces that aren't actually full words.  '''Indescribable''' can be broken down into '''in-''', '''describe''', and '''-able'''.  You will notice that ''in-'' and ''-able'', while not full words, still mean something (even if what they mean  isn't exactly clear); the same word-parts appear in '''inadequate''' and '''readable''' and many other words.

These 'half words' are called affixes, and they build new words from simpler words or based on stems which do not stand alone (like in Latin, stems are a part of words, like &quot;cor-&quot;).  (There are also affixes that change properties of a word without changing what word it is, like English ''-s'' for plural. The '''inflection''', like plural &quot;s&quot;, can be applied using affixes, but we'll deal with those in the [[../Grammar|next section]].)  You'll almost certainly want some word-building affixes for your conlang.  They give your vocabulary texture, and the more of them you have, the more words you can add to your vocabulary just by inventing one new simple word.

There are lots of different kinds of affixes, depending on how they change a word when they attach to it.  Some simple techniques you can use:
*add onto the front of a word (like ''in-'').
*add onto the end of a word (like ''-able'').
*insert into the middle of a word (like hip-hop ''-iz-'' in '''house'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''hizouse''').
*change part of a word (like '''goose'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''geese'''; of course that affix doesn't build a new word, but it shows another way an affix can work).
An affix may take different forms on different words, like ''-able'' that on some words becomes ''-ible''.  Sometimes the forms used on different words are so different that you might think of them as different affixes, that just happen to mean the same thing and apply to entirely different sets of words &amp;mdash; like the plural affix in '''goose'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''geese''', where for most English words the plural affix has the form ''-s'' or ''-es''. 

If you set up your word-building affixes to work the same way as in English, even if they use different sounds and attach differently, they'll still make your conlang [[Conlang/Types#Relexes|feel similar to English]].  For example, if you have an affix equivalent to English ''un-'', don't use it exactly the way English does.  Experiment with it &amp;mdash; you might have no word for &quot;bad&quot;, but have &quot;ungood&quot; instead; maybe have a word for &quot;uncommon&quot; that doesn't use the &quot;un-&quot;, in the same way &quot;bad&quot; isn't &quot;ungood&quot;.

== Vocabulary ==

The English word '''manual''' comes from the Latin word ''manus'', which means &quot;hand&quot;.  Right?  Well, sort of.  Latin is a language with relatively few different words, so each word has to do a lot of work.  The Latin word ''manus'' does mean &quot;hand&quot;, the part of the human anatomy; but it also means &quot;fist&quot;; &quot;handwriting&quot;; &quot;finishing touch&quot;; &quot;workmanship&quot;; &quot;team&quot;; &quot;gang&quot;; &quot;band of soldiers&quot;; and &quot;trunk&quot;, the part of the anatomy of an elephant.  The English language has a tremendous number of different words, so the average word doesn't have to do nearly as much &amp;mdash; but especially basic and common words may still have a fairly wide range of meanings, and the English word '''hand''' is like that; it can mean everything from a person's handwriting (like in Latin), or the pointy bits on a clock face, to the set of cards that a player holds in a card game.  (Compare: [[wikt:manus#Latin|Latin '''''manus''''']], [[wikt:hand#English|English '''hand''']].)

No word in one natlang means exactly the same thing as any word in another natlang.  To keep your conlang from feeling like English, don't give it words for just the same concepts as in English.  Try to invent words that have the meanings of more than one English word, or are more specific than English words.  Even better are words that fall between levels of description in English.  For example, you might create a word that means &quot;a four-legged hairy animal&quot;, to cover '''dog''' as well as '''horse''', but not as much as '''mammal''' or '''animal'''.  Think about a whole set of related or similar things (for instance, colors, animals, or family relationships), and how your language can divide that mass of reality into manageable parts in a different way than English.  And think about additional, perhaps figurative, senses of a word (like all those extra meanings for ''manus'' or ''hand'').

You can even create words for concepts that are only very clumsily expressed in English, such as: ''that awkward situation when something has happened, which is known to more than one present party, which neither wish to speak about, and suddenly they have nothing to say to each other''.  Another word could mean the same thing, but with another, unknowing party present, who senses a weird atmosphere between the other parties.

Part of the challenge of conlanging &amp;mdash; whether you're building an artlang, engelang, or auxlang &amp;mdash; is that you won't really know how your language is going to feel until you've got enough of it together to start saying interesting things in it.  (That's also one reason why conlangers may tend to keep tinkering with their creations.)  So how can you tell, early in building your vocabulary, whether it will come out too much like English?  Well, as a rule of thumb, building a vocabulary of a hundred words or so should be a pretty massive job &amp;mdash; done properly, it's a major milestone, like a small company landing its first big client &amp;mdash; and each additional hundred words should be heavy work as well.  If you easily reach, say, a thousand words, you're probably in real danger of producing a conlang that will always feel too much like your native language, no matter what sounds and grammar you give it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to the Series==
This book is part of a series of three text books on data structures and algorithms:

* [[Computer Science:Data Structures|Data Structures]] -- A book suitable for a first course in data structures that presents the most common data abstractions and their construction and properties. A tutorial on the most key points.
* [[Algorithms|Algorithms]] -- A book suitable for a first course in algorithms that presents the most common algorithmic techniques and how to analyze algorithms. Assumes some knowledge of data structures. A tutorial on the most key points.
* [[Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms|Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms]] -- A book that covers more advanced material that assumes some prior knowledge of data structures and algorithms. While the first two books are tutorials, this book is more reference based. Thus, its content can be much more eclectic. Advanced (and interesting) material that doesn't fall into the tutorial nature of the first two books belongs in this book.

The reason these books are in a series is to help narrow their focus and to aid coordination of the efforts. An eventual goal is that books will be available for every computer science subject.

==Guidelines==
# If you want to fix a bug, simply click on &quot;edit&quot;, make your changes, and click on save. We'll review the changes to be sure they are appropriate for the book. If you are unsure, you can visit the &quot;discussion&quot; page and ask there. In general, to make a small change, you don't need to ask first, and you can just use common sense to determine if your change is appropriate.
# If you would like to write a chapter, section, or part of a section, take a look at the items marked with &quot;TODO&quot; tags and start there.
# Be sure to read all other sections of the book first in order to avoid duplication of content.
# When writing a section, you can mark some parts as &quot;[TODO: ''explanation'']&quot;, where ''explanation'' describes what you intend to take place in that part. For example, if you aren't good at making images, you can make as a TODO item a description of the image that should go there. Perhaps someone who is effective at making images will notice this and provide one for you. The purpose of a TODO item is to give the plan of what should be written.
# This is a tutorial: We aren't aiming to create an encyclopedia of every algorithm ever created, nor are we trying to present the absolutely best versions of particular algorithms.
# Don't include links to wikipedia articles in the book's chapters: The idea is that each book is self-contained so a reader can print out the book and read it separately, instead of having to navigate through it online.
# The book uses a pseudocode language that should be familiar enough to those who know Algol-family languages (including C, Java, Pascal, and Python). It includes extra features that help abstract away nitty-gritty implementation details, and thus allows for the real algorithmic idea to be communicated, rather than focusing on the trivial implementation issues that are language dependent.
# Implementations in non pseudocode can be written for an appendix. These implementations can serve to be usable by readers and to make clear any possible ambiguities. Implementations should be tested well and include test cases. Implementation languages are Python, C, Java and Scheme.
# Put a star (&quot;*&quot;) next to section or sub-section titles if the material presented there isn't essential to understanding the larger point of the chapter. (For example, a more junior reader might elect to skip or skim these sections.)
# Use primary sources when possible. If you do use a reference, put it on the references section. Never copy content without asking permission. Further, note that even some GFDL content uses a different license version (not all are forward compatible, either) and should not be copied without permission.
# Use the wikipedia as another source for material, but edit the material to present only the main points and ideas: the encyclopedic detail of the wikipedia can become a distraction when trying to learn just the basic concepts.
# Use the mathematical royal &quot;we&quot; for some phrases, but try to use the second-person &quot;you&quot; as much as possible: it makes sentences easier to construct that also sound more direct.
# Look for insights into understanding an algorithm or a part of the software engineering process in general.
# Avoid using the [[w:passive voice|passive voice]] (&quot;The article was written by us.&quot;).  Instead, try to use the [[w:active voice|active voice]] (&quot;We wrote the article.&quot;).
# Don't use &quot;this&quot; as a pronoun, only use it as an adjective.

==Development Phases==
# A table of contents should be created and more or less agreed upon. Such a table will set the scope for the book. Changes, of course, can be made later. ({{stage short|100%|May 28, 2005}} ''DONE'': The TOC is more or less agreed upon by contributors)
# After the chapters are broken up, the sections and subsections should be designed, with TODO items describing the content to go in that place. ({{stage short|100%|May 28, 2005}} ''DONE'')
# The most important concepts should be written first, to provide an anchor and context for the other material to be built from. ({{stage short|50%|May 28, 2005}} ''IN PROGRESS'': Join us!)
# Implement C, Java, Python and Scheme versions of the algorithms and put them in the appendixes. ({{stage short|00%|May 28, 2005}} Still ''TODO''...)
# Similar to an open-source project, more and more &quot;features&quot; (i.e., chapters and sections) should be added. This stage will happen after the First Edition milestone is met. However, when making improvements for the second edition, core items shouldn't be neglected. ({{stage short|00%|May 28, 2005}} Still ''TODO''...)

Writing a book takes time and dedication, but if you've come this far, it's probably going to be worth it. Just as free software programs don't simply drop from the tree, whole open books won't write themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trigonometry is the study of the properties of triangles. 

* '''&quot;Tri&quot;''' is Ancient Greek word for three, 
* '''&quot;gon&quot;''' means angle, 
* '''&quot;metry&quot;''' measurement

Together they make &quot;measuring three angles of a triangle&quot;. 

If you know some facts about a triangle, such as the lengths of its sides, then using trigonometry you can find out other facts about it.  If you know the lengths of sides then you can find what the angles are.  If you know the length of one side and of two of the angles, then you can work out what the remaining angle is, and also what the lengths of the other two sides are.

As a consequence the Ancient Greeks were able to use trigonometry to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. &lt;!--Link to a page showing how--&gt;

==Starting Learning Trigonometry==

One of the first things we learn in trigonometry is how to calculate what the third angle in a triangle is when given the other two angles.  For example, in a triangle if two of the angles are &lt;math&gt;60^{\circ}\,&lt;/math&gt; then the third angle must be &lt;math&gt;60^{\circ}\,&lt;/math&gt; too.

However, if we're instead told two lengths, say 7cm and 10cm, and if we're not told anything about the angles, then the third length has a range of possibilities.  It could be 5cm.  It could be 15cm.  

To calculate lengths we start out by examining a right-angled triangle, i.e. one where one of the angles is &lt;math&gt;90^{\circ}\,&lt;/math&gt;.  [[File:Rtriangle.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|A right-angle triangle]]  

We'll be using right-angled triangles a lot.

In a right-angled triangle we ''can'' work out the length of the longest side if given the lengths of the two shorter sides.  In a right-angled triangle the lengths of the sides have a particularly nice relationship to each other.  The formula for this relationship is written:

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

How you use this formula to calculate the third side when you know two of the sides in a right-angled triangle is explained in the page on the '[[../Pythagorean Theorem|Pythagoras' Theorem]]'

What if the triangle isn't a right-angled triangle, though?  What if it doesn't have a right angle?

More complex triangles can be built by joining right-angled triangles together.  What we learn about right-angled triangles enables us to work with other kinds of triangles too.  Trigonometry and trigonometric functions can also be used with more complex shapes such as squares, hexagons, circles and ellipses.  Ultimately the most important mathematical tools we have for measuring the universe are based on the study of the mathematics of triangles.

Trigonometry is a fundamental step in your mathematical education. From the seemingly simple shape, the right triangle, we gain tools and insight that help us in practical and theoretical endeavors. The subtle mathematical relationships between the right triangle, the circle, the sine wave, and the exponential curve can only be fully understood with a firm foundation in trigonometry.

===In Review===

Here are some useful formulas that should be learned before delving into trigonometry:

:Pythagorean Theorem: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;, in a right triangle where ''a'' and ''b'' are the two sides, and ''c'' is the hypotenuse.
:Pythagorean Triples: 3-4-5 (the two smaller values being the sides, with the larger the hypotenuse), 5-12-13, 7-24-25, 8-15-17, and any multiples of these (including 6-8-10, 10-24-26, etc.) 
===Properties of Special Right Triangles=== 
In a 45-45-90 right triangle, i.e., an isosceles right triangle, let one leg be x. The hypotenuse is then x&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;
In a 30-60-90 right triangle, let the short leg, i.e. the leg opposite the 30° angle, be x. The hypotenuse is then equal to 2x and the longer leg, i.e. the leg opposite the 60° angle, is equal to x*&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with the lengths of the sides and size of the angles of triangles.  Because many physical questions can be framed in terms of triangles, trigonometry has found wide use in the physical sciences and engineering. 

Trigonometry is needed in surveying and architecture since relationships between lengths and angles in triangles are used directly.

Trigonometry is also used in electrical engineering.  The functions that relate angles and side lengths in right triangles turn out to also be useful in expressing how AC electric current varies with time.&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

:You just add a standard link to wikipedia's page on the subject. [[User:Programmermatt|Programmermatt]] 20:38, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

According to the Wikipedia article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal Sexagesimal], it was the ancient Sumerians who first invented it, not the Greeks. Is this correct? [[User:Gotsomeideas|Gotsomeideas]] ([[User talk:Gotsomeideas|talk]]) 21:17, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

James.Spudemann made a HUGE edit where he changed the nature of the introduction.  An introduction should, I think, promote eagerness in the reader to learn the subject, but I don't think the new introduction does that.  I'll change the introduction with this in mind. [[Special:Contributions/79.79.171.154|79.79.171.154]] ([[User talk:79.79.171.154|talk]]) 10:19, 31 July 2010 (UTC)

I agree that was a hugely significant edit.  It lost some important content and changed the book's tone.  I feel that for someone wanting to learn trigonometry the original introduction, before James.Spademann's historical notes, was way better.  This is in fact a general problem with how the book is shaping up.  It's becoming less suitable for someone learning how to do trigonometry.  I am adding back the lost material and making the historical background something readers are more likely to skip over on a first reading.

Religion is about our 'human spirit'. This may mean a simple shared philosophy, such as a 'team spirit'  familiar to participants of successful sporting and military activities, or a highly complex set of religious beliefs, sacred laws and temporal regulations about how 'we' may conduct ourselves and how 'they' -the rest of the world - is (or should be) properly ordered. 

==History==
Religion is a cultural manifestation that may have had a role in the survival of human groups and nations. Traditionally most religions were enforced, and people who failed to conform to religious rules (apostasy) or who expressed doubt (blasphemy) or interpreted things differently (heresy) were severely punished, often by death. Generally religion requires its adherents to support each other, and either enables or requires enemies (including the 'internal' dissidents just mentioned) to be suppressed or killed 'lawfully' within a general philosophy of 'divine justice' or some specific pronouncement of 'justified war'.

Religions develop depending on the way of life: Gathering and field work once were female activities and are highly dependent on the soil, leading to earth godesses. On the other hand, hunting and pastoral work were reserved for men, causing their gods to be male. These gods are often associated with the weather or the sky.

==Distortions==
In much of the western world, where Christianity is dominant, a common mis-conception of religion is simply that it involves a  God, or god-like figures such as emperors, royal households or priestly organizations. Since such people are supposedly 'appointed by God' they are generally assumed to be divinely authorized to rule, utterly incapable of error and so worthy of praise, love and devotion. 

This westernized view is however, extremely incomplete. It excludes many human activities that generally fall under the heading of &quot;religion&quot; and distorts the spiritual beliefs of many people in other religions. 

For example, Buddhism is a religion without a God. Though many forms of it have imagined the Buddha as a Christ-like figure, other Buddhists think of him as an historical figure -- not to be worshipped, but respected as a man of insight who set an example for others to follow. 

Afro-Cuban religions like Vodoun include ''loa'', powerful beings who are not gods, and are not worshipped, but are dealt with as we deal with our fellow humans. Believers allow these beings to possess them, under certain specific and controlled circumstances, in order to converse with them and receive advice. Quasi-religious practices, such as Taoism, or certain tantric schools, are harder still to classify in any easy way.

So before we can arrive at a toolbox for building a constructed religion, we must arrive at a reasonable definition. I propose the following as a reasonable definition of a religion: A set of metaphysical beliefs that describe the sort of existence we live in, suggests a goal its adherents wish to attain, and prescribes a method whereby that goal may be obtained by the individual.

== Forms of Religion ==
Religions take many forms and variations.  Don't let difficult words (and -isms) scare you! Some of them are described below, but the most common forms are atheism (believing that there is no god), agnosticism (unsure if god exists or not), monotheism (one God), polytheism (many gods) as well as monolatrism, polylatrism, henotheism, kathenotheism, deism, idealism, and animism.

=== Atheism and Humanism ===
Atheism is non belief in Gods and Goddesses. 
( Theism is belief in one or more of these. 
&quot;A&quot; is from Greek, meaning &quot;not&quot;,&quot;without&quot;; hence &quot;Atheism&quot; is &quot;Without Theism&quot;.)

Atheists hold that ideas of Deities are merely human constructs. 

Humanists omit belief in the Supernatural and concentrate on human life in this world.
Some humanist groups have trained officiants to lead weddings, funerals, namings or other life-passage ceremonies if individuals need them.

All ethics are seen as derived from human understanding of actions and their consequences.
Laws are not seen as given by Deities but arise out of society's consensus about how actions should be regulated.

Those who find Theism unbelievable of course share the common goals of all people who want to live in societies that promote happiness and security.

=== Agnosticism ===
View that God’s existence is unprovable: the belief that it is impossible to know whether or not God exists. Agnosticism is rarely the basis for a whole belief system but is commonly associated with atheism or skepticism.

=== Monotheism ===
Monotheism is the belief in one single god exclusively, and that no other gods exist.  This is the form professed by most, if not all, denominations of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, although Trinitarian sects of Christianity are sometimes construed &amp;mdash; generally not by their own followers &amp;mdash; to have a &quot;pantheon&quot; of three gods (the Trinity).

=== Polytheism ===
Polytheism is the counterpart of monotheism and holds that multiple gods (forming what is usually called a pantheon) exist. Most of the religions now regarded as &quot;mythology&quot; and most neopagan religions embrace some form of polytheism.

=== Monolatrism ===
''(Note: Different definitions of Monolatrism appear. The definition given here is not the only one.)''
Monolatrists worship only one god, but believe other gods exist. They believe that the other gods leave non-worshippers alone. It has been suggested that early Judaism was a monolatrism based on alleged references to other gods in sacred texts.

=== Polylatrism ===
''(Note: Polylatrism is not a word in real usage. It is used here for convenience and because the word just makes sense.)''
Polylatrism implies that a people worships a sub-set of gods exclusively but believes in the existence of other gods. They believe that other gods leave non-worshippers alone. Many neo-Pagans adhere to something akin to polylatrism, but the closest thing to a historical example we have might be the ancient Celts, which evidence suggests held a policy of &quot;you worship your gods, we'll worship ours&quot;.

=== Kathenotheism ===
Kathenotheism is a hard concept for many to understand, but might be best described as worshipping a Divine Office instead of the god holding it. Kathenotheists might believe there is a series or cycle of supreme deities, and worship each one for only as long as they hold the power of supreme god.

=== Henotheism ===
Henotheists worship one single god while not denying the existence of others. The difference between henotheism and monolatrism is that henotheists seem believe that the non-worshipped gods have power over those who don't believe in them.

=== Deism ===
''(Note: Deism has had many forms over the years. This is just one.)''
Deists assert that a power created the world but abandoned it, or at least doesn't interfere with it. Some forms of Deism say that in creating the world, the creator became part of it; this is a kind of pantheism. This form of religion appeared heavily in the thinking of many Enlightenment era philosophers, though not as of yet in a major religion. Famous Deists include Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.

=== Idealism ===
Idealists, in this sense, worship or strive toward a creed, philosophy, or perfect ideal and might be considered a secular religion. Examples include the North Korean philosophy of Juche and arguably many forms of Buddhism.

=== Animism ===
Animists believe that a soul or other supernatural power is in every single object. Mostly associated with pre-agricultural or hunter-gatherer cultures.

=== Manism ===
Manism is based on the belief that the deceased, often family members, mythological ancestors or saints, have a continued existence and/or possess the ability to influence the fortune of the living. Manism is most frequent in settled cultures.

== Concepts of Death ==
=== Reincarnation ===
This is a belief that after death, one will be born again in some form. There are many belief systems around this idea. A Southeast Asian folk tradition holds that one is reborn into the same family, so that you might be your Great-Aunt Edith. 

The most famous belief system pertaining to reincarnation is that of the Hindu Brahmins, which was exported to many lands and forms the basis of many New Age philosophies. In Brahminism, acceptance of one's station in life is necessary to improvements to one's status in future lives. Thus, a wealthy member of the nobility deserves his good fortune because of his actions in past lives, and the low-caste and untouchables similarly deserve their fate. The ultimate state, nirvana, is an extinguishing of all personality and desire. 

Not all who believe in reincarnation share this philosophy. Gnostic Christians, Druids, and Native Americans among many others have their own ideas of what it is like.

=== Nothingness after Death ===
This is the belief that nothing happens after death, except the bodily functions and consciousness cease. Most people would agree that the lives of the more charismatic ancients are recorded in human fable, religious tradition or vernacular (written) historical records. It is thus common for humans to achieve a sort of vicarious immortality simply by leading a full life which is interesting so capable of being 'bought alive' in the minds of our survivors and their students.  

=== Afterlife ===
This is the belief that some kind of world (an ideal heaven, limbo, underworld, or torment in hell) exists beyond the grave. It often provides at least two possibilities of happiness and torture based upon one's performance in life, or specific actions in one's life. This can be a powerful control myth for young impressionable warriors who may face death on the battlefield, and who must obey orders without question if their army is to be successful.  It is also a useful mechanism for instilling 'ethical values' and promoting 'righteous behavior'.

The underworld, like the Ancient Greek Tartaros, might also be akin to nothingness; the dualism of Heaven and Hell is actually a quite recent invention. According to the Romans and Greeks, everyone &amp;mdash;except for those who had directly committed a crime against the gods or those who had been really virtuous heroes&amp;mdash; would go to the Asphodel Meadows, a vast land with nothing in it. It might be compared to Purgatory, although the Asphodel Meadows were permanent.

Spiritualists believe that the next life is a place where one goes on learning and having a variety of experiences just as we do during our lifetimes. Many ancient peoples including the Egyptians conceived of the afterlife as being like Earth but without life's problems.

== Ritual ==
Although often overlooked, ritual holds an important place in human behavior. Ritual means repeating a sequence of activities in a routine (formulaic) way. Ritual may be something trivial, such as wearing 'lucky' clothes for certain important occasions such as job interviews, or extremely important aides to memory, such as the checks performed by a pilot before attempting to fly an airplane. Religious rituals generally are performed to make sure that all participants are 'of one mind' - that they have the same understanding of 'right' and wrong' behaviour. 

Some rituals may seem bizarre, but hold an important 'survival'  truth. The Pagan belief in sowing seed in the nude is an example. Without clothes, the farmer is sensitive to the air temperature, wind speed, soil condition, moisture content, presence of predators and so on. The 'comfortable' condition (in Southern Europe, where the practice emerged) just happens to be about ideal for seed germination, and so people who performed this naked sowing ritual also tended to have better harvests than those who did not!

Most religious rituals  tend to be simply routine reminders of our ancestors successful seasonal habits. The feasts of special food (for example the Western Christmas or Saturnalia, which is a winter solstice feast that tends to prevent depression) or fasts or absence of something familiar (Notably in early spring, when food is scarce, and we need to lose fat gained during winter) are common manifestations of formerly successful seasonal survival strategies for our ancestors, who lacked central heating and refrigerators. 

Most important however (both for a human survival and for our sheer enjoyment of human life) are public or religious celebrations of life's major events - birth, academic achievement, maturity, marriage, child rearing, sagacity and death. Most of these 'life changing' celebrations have become adapted, stylized and documented to reliably provide example, advice and guidance to attendees who aspire to achieving such goals.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is the primary conditional structure in Perl. The syntax is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if (''boolean expression'') {
    ''statement'';
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If the ''boolean expression'' evaluates to true, the statements between the two braces will be executed. The braces around statements are mandatory, even if there is only one statement (unlike C or Java).

An alternative syntax to the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement may be used on a single statement. This involves putting the conditional at the end of the statement rather than before, and does not include braces:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
''statement'' if (''boolean expression'') ;
&lt;/source&gt;

The following statements are synonymous:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ($x == 20) { print &quot;hello&quot;; }
print &quot;hello&quot; if ($x == 20);
&lt;/source&gt;

You should choose whichever one is clearer in a given situation. For example, the following is legal, but unclear:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
foreach my $word (@words) {
    if ($word eq 'end') { last; }
    print &quot;$word\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This ''hides'' the &lt;code&gt;last&lt;/code&gt; (that is like &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;, and ends the loop) over at the right. Instead use a postfix &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
foreach my $word (@words) {
    last if $word eq 'end';
    print &quot;$word\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''boolean expression'' conditional can contain any one of the comparison operators covered in the next section.

Multiple conditions can be checked together using the boolean expression operators:

* &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;  - logical and, C style; used for most conditionals
* &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; - logical and, but with a lower precedence; used for flow control 
* &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;  - logical or, C style; used for most conditionals
* &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt;  - logical or, but with a lower precedence; used for flow control 
* &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;   - logical not, C style
* &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; - logical not, but with a lower precedence

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if (($x == 20) || (($x &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; ($x &lt; 10) &amp;&amp; !($x == 5))) {
    print &quot;x is equal to 20 or either between 0 and 10, but not 5.\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Conditional statements can also be extended with the &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; structures:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 if (''boolean expression 1'') {
     ''statement 1;''
 } elsif (''boolean expression 2'') {
     ''statement 2;''
 } else {
     ''statement 3;''
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is followed by any number (including zero) of &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; statements, and finally an optional &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; statement. The statements of an &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; will be executed, if its boolean expression is true, and no preceding &lt;code&gt;(els)if&lt;/code&gt; statement's boolean expression is true. The trailing &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; (if present) is executed, if none of the preceding statements' boolean expressions are true.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A Perl hash is similar to an ordinary array, but instead of using integer indexes, a hash uses &quot;keys&quot; that can take on any scalar value.   These are usually strings or numbers.

Syntax: instead of the &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; operator, associative arrays use the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; symbol, and rather than square brackets &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, as in  &lt;code&gt;$myarray[0]&lt;/code&gt;, hash elements are referenced using curly brackets &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;, as in &lt;code&gt;$myhash{&quot;george&quot;}&lt;/code&gt;.

Hashes are one of the most powerful and commonly used features in Perl.   A typical use would be to build a hash that contains a &quot;dictionary&quot;, with each key being a word in the dictionary, and the corresponding values being the definitions of those words.

A hash containing the sounds various household pets make is below
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my %petsounds = (&quot;cat&quot; =&gt; &quot;meow&quot;,
                 &quot;dog&quot; =&gt; &quot;woof&quot;,
                 &quot;snake&quot; =&gt; &quot;hiss&quot;);   
&lt;/source&gt;

'=&gt;' and ',' are actually interchangeable, so the right side could look exactly like an array. This means that you can assign an array to a hash. In such an assignment, each element with an even index (starting from 0) in the array becomes a key in the hash. The following statements create the same hash as the previous one does
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my @array = (&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;meow&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;woof&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;, &quot;hiss&quot;);
my %petsounds = @array;   
&lt;/source&gt;
But the first style is more preferred because it makes the statement more readable.

To access a hash element, use the curly brackets:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
 print STDOUT &quot;The cat goes &quot; . $petsounds{&quot;cat&quot;} . &quot;.\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
will print the following to STDOUT

 The cat goes meow.
 
To add a new sound item to a hash
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$petsounds{&quot;mouse&quot;} = &quot;squeak!&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;
To overwrite an existing element, just reassign it
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$petsounds{&quot;dog&quot;} = &quot;arf!&quot;;  # The dog now goes &quot;arf!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
To remove an item from a hash, use &lt;tt&gt;delete&lt;/tt&gt;. Setting the value to &lt;tt&gt;undef&lt;/tt&gt; does not delete the item; using &lt;tt&gt;exists&lt;/tt&gt; on a key that has been set to &lt;tt&gt;undef&lt;/tt&gt; will still return true.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
delete($petsounds{&quot;cat&quot;});  # will remove &quot;cat&quot; from our hash
&lt;/source&gt;
== &quot;Associative Arrays&quot; ==

Originally, a &quot;hash&quot; was called an &quot;associative array&quot;, but this term is a bit outdated (people just got sick and tired of using seven syllables).  Although it isn't intuitive for newcomers to programming, &quot;hash&quot; is now the preferred term. The name is derived from the computer science term, [[w:Hashtable|hashtable]].

== Working with hashes ==

=== Printing hash contents ===
If you know PHP, you may have thought by now of some convenient way to print the contents of your array the way &lt;code&gt;print_r&lt;/code&gt; does...
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use Data::Dumper;

print Dumper(\%hash);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Counting the number of entries in a hash ===
To get the size of the hash, simply find the size of the result of the &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; function, by evaluating it in scalar context:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my %hash = (
   'key1' =&gt; 1,
   'key2' =&gt; 2
);

print &quot;Hash has &quot; . keys(%hash) . &quot; elements\n&quot;;
my $num_elements = scalar(keys(%hash));
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hash of Hashes of Hashes ==
You can define multidimensional hash array variables. An example may look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
use Data::Dumper;
 
my %a=();
 
$a{1}{&quot;a&quot;}{&quot;A&quot;}=&quot;FIRST&quot;;
$a{1}{&quot;c&quot;}{&quot;B&quot;}=&quot;THIRD&quot;;
$a{1}{&quot;b&quot;}{&quot;C&quot;}=&quot;SECOND&quot;;
  
foreach my $k1 ( sort keys %a ) {
  foreach my $k2 ( sort keys %{$a{$k1}} ) {
    foreach my $k3 ( sort keys %{$a{$k1}{$k2}} ) {
      print &quot;$k1\t$k2\t$k3\t$a{$k1}{$k2}{$k3}\n&quot;;
    }
  }
}
  
print Dumper(\%a);
&lt;/source&gt;

This code will produce:

  1       a       A       FIRST
  1       b       C       SECOND
  1       c       B       THIRD
  $VAR1 = {
            '1' =&gt; {
                     'c' =&gt; {
                              'B' =&gt; 'THIRD'
                            },
                     'a' =&gt; {
                              'A' =&gt; 'FIRST'
                            },
                     'b' =&gt; {
                              'C' =&gt; 'SECOND'
                            }
                   }
          };

===Purpose===
This book is intended for Java Developers, but other developers may also find some sections useful. 

The goal of this book to make the reader a better (Java) Programmer.

Intended Audience - (Java) developers, anyone interested in improving the way he/she programs.

Prerequisites - None

===Acknowledgements===

===Getting Started===
As described in [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse] website, Eclipse is an IDE for everything and nothing in particular.  Eclipse core is a universal IDE (a general purpose development environment).

=====Downloading Eclipse=====
Eclipse doesn't come with the JRE. It is advisable that you download the latest JRE (Java Runtime Environment) from the [http://www.javasoft.com Javasoft] web site first.

After you have downloaded and installed the JRE, you may then download the [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse IDE]. Another version of Eclipse is the EasyEclipse project. Its interface is about the same as Eclipse. You can download it instead from [easyeclipse.org]

=====Installing Eclipse=====
Installing Eclipse just involves unzipping the downloaded file into a directory. After unzipping the Eclipse IDE is ready to run.

=====Running Eclipse=====

===Windows===
Eclipse can be run by executing the file '''startup.jar'''. If Java Environment (JAVA_HOME) variables are defined then Eclipse IDE will automatically detect the JRE and start running.

==Linux==
After downloading, open the file '''eclipse'''.

=====Getting Help=====
Types of help available with eclipse:
# Online documentation
# Context sensitive help
# Hover help
# Active Help

Eclipse Help can be accessed using external browser
&lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path_for_help_content&gt;
&lt;port&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The values for these fields can be found in preferences.ini file. 
Eclipse uses a tomcat server for displaying help documentation.

=====Configuring Eclipse=====
* Tuning your JRE
(Use different workspaces for different JREs otherwise due to autobuild wrong .class files will get generated)

====Using Eclipse====
=====Workspace=====
Resource (projects, folders, files)

.metadata folder contains information about the workspace.

Keep different workspaces for different development projects (or different customers)

Bookmarks - A bookmark acts as a link to a particular line in a file. 

Tasks - A task is created against each java error. Tasks can also be created as an reminder for some activities to be performed. Task contains priority and completion status. Tasks can also work as bookmarks.

* Running Multiple Instances of Eclipse at the same time
(See command line options)

=====Perspectives=====
You can create your own (customized) perspective using configurations.

====Running Other Applications within Eclipse====
* File Association (External Programs) 
* Run (External Tools)

need a &quot;how to&quot;/tutorial for External Tools running a main class in one project while referencing a jar file elsewhere.
ex. project DoesReallyNeatStuff creates output based on project SomeStuff. How does a project reference the other project using External Tools?

====Java Development using Eclipse====
* Writing Code - generate, edit and navigate Java code.
syntax highlighting, code completion, code assist, tasks and views.  
* Debugging
* Team Work
* Improving Productivity - hooking into well defined plugin points
* Using Eclipse Code
=====Debugging Java Programs=====
=====Working in a Team=====

====Miscellaneous====
[http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Branding/branding-your-application.html Branding your application]

* Eclipse - tool integration platform - open source
* Eclipse community - 1000s of developers - around 50 software companies
* Eclipse vision - new paradigm for development tools - platform centric - not tool centric - towards Universal IDE
* Eclipse Project - tools built independently - work together as integrated sets
* Eclipse Plug-ins - seamless integration - your imagination is the limited - 100 active Open Source Projects and vendors.

===Highlights===

* Eclipse 3-in-1 - a Java development environment, a tool integration platform, and an open source community.

* Editor -anticipates your next move - code assist , think faster that you write use spell checker, refactoring - iterative process of improving your code Object Oriented approach, scrapbook - experiment with expressions, search tools,
debugger - breakpoints, display value of variable, hot code replace support - change your code while in debug mode,
preference settings - tailor according to your needs yourself, 

* General purpose - For both programming and non-programming development tasks
Java doc comments templates

integrated support for Ant, JUnit 

====Basic Concepts====
* Developer's Toolset - (design) modelling tool, IDE, version control, word processor,
* Artifacts - architecture diagrams, code and user documentation

* '''Workspace''' is a directory where your projects are stored.
* '''Workbench''' consists of views, perspectives and editors.
* '''Views''' provide alternate way of navigation.
* '''Editors''' are associated with the file types. External editors can also be used with editors. OLE based editors integrates well with Eclipse.
* '''Perspectives''' are collection of views.

* Text editor
* Outline view
* Bookmarks view
* Editor status area
* Tasks view - 
predefined tags TODO, FIXME, XXX
* Stacked view
* Help View

====Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)====
The SWT is a collection of APIs that allow writing GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces).  The APIs are focused on providing tools to allow &quot;widgets&quot; (graphical controls such as checkboxes, edit controls, etc.) to be displayed and manipulated.

====Related Projects====
EMF - Eclipse Modelling Framework
EMF is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building tools and other applications based on a structured data model.  EMF allows a model described using Annotated Java, XML or modeling tools to be generated as executable Java code.  The generated code allows the model structure to be inspected, and the model data to be queried, updated and persisted to external storage.

According to this page: http://www.thejapanesepage.com/hka.htm the stroke order for the 'ka' is different...

I learned in elementary school: curve-line → slash → spot, and I think you can write better in this way.
But the stroke order is not so important...(if you can write well, that's ok) --[[User:Brevam|Brev]][[user talk:Brevam|am]] 03:41, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I learned sweeping curve, vertical line, dot.  Also, GO is next to KO, as well as in the alternate section near GE, etc. I think the one near KO is unneeded and identical.

== Mneumonic for Ko ==

It seems a little more complicated than it needs to be. Why not leave out the &quot;far away, closer to you&quot; stuff? That's not relevant for remembering the two lines being start and finish lines and &quot;Go!&quot; I'm going to edit it to make it simpler, but if there's some reason for the additional complexity feel free to revert. --Anonymous 2008/01/08

:Nevermind. I see that it was all because of the &quot;tail&quot; on the top line; but it's a very confusing mneumonic. It should probably be rewritten. In any case, I'm just going to ignore all that stuff and just remember &quot;Go!&quot;</text>

==Introduction==

An important part of being able to understand and speak Korean is that one must have a firm understanding of the grammar used to make coherent sentences.  During these first few lessons we shall focus on building a useable grammar base.  In this lesson, we will learn some more useful particles, Present progressive, future tense, and the requesting form.  We will also learn some new grammar, but it will not be the main focus of this lesson.

==Conversation==

Here we find Joseph meeting 찬호 again.

===Dialogue===
: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''앗! 오래간만 입니다, 조세프!'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''네, 안녕하십니까, 찬호?'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''네. 저는 지금 학교로 가고 있습니다.'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''선생님을 만나겠습니까?'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''아니요, 공부하겠습니다. 조세프는 오늘 숙제를 하겠습니까?'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''네, 저는 집에서 하겠습니다.'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''그래요.  안녕히 가십시오.'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''안녕히 계십시오.'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Conversation review==

찬호 begins with another greeting:

: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''[[wikt:앗|앗]]! [[wikt:오래간만|오래간만]] [[wikt:이다|입니다]], 조세프!'''&lt;/big&gt;

&quot;오래간만 입니다&quot; can be translated as: &quot;Long time, no see&quot; in English.  At first, it's a hard expression to pronounce, but a little bit of practice should untie your tongue.

: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''네, 안녕하십니까, 찬호?'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''네. 저는 [[wikt:지금|지금]] 학교로 가고 있습니다.'''&lt;/big&gt;

{| border=solid
|-align=center style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;
| 네. || 저는 || 지금 || 학교 || [[wikt:로|로]] || [[wikt:가다|가]] || 고 있습니다
|-align=center
| Yes. || I (topic) || now || school || (to/towards) || go (verb stem) || (present progressive) 
|}

New vocabulary, new particle, new verb tense. [[wikt:지금|지금]] means “now”.  In a later lesson, we will learn many words such as &quot;later, tomorrow, yesterday, just a second ago, etc&quot;.  In the next part, 찬호 uses a new particle with a similar meaning to what we learned before: &quot;N + (으)로&quot;.  This particle means &quot;to&quot;, &quot;toward&quot;, or &quot;in the direction of&quot;.  It can be interchanged with &quot;에&quot; relatively safely, but &quot;로&quot; with its additional usages, is a little more versatile. If the noun ends in a consonant then it becomes &quot;으로&quot; (집'''으'''로).  Simple.

Finally, we have a new verb tense: the present progressive tense.  It can also be made into a statement or question by adding the &quot;VS + 고 있습니다&quot; or &quot;VS + 고 있습니까&quot; forms.  The strange thing about this verb tense is that the standard &quot;VS + ㅂ/습니다&quot; can mean the same thing! Remember in lesson 1, Joseph said &quot;집에 갑니다&quot;.  This could have also been said &quot;집에 가고있습니다&quot; or even &quot;집으로 가고 있습니다.&quot;  It is your choice.  Some combinations sound more natural to others, but a beginning student doesn't have to be concerned with that.  You will eventually get the feel of what sounds right.

: 조새프: &lt;big&gt;'''[[wikt:선생|선생]]님을 만나겠습니까?'''&lt;/big&gt;

This might sound funny, but one of the most important things to learn in Korean is '''not''' found in this sentence.  Where is the subject?  Is it [[wikt:선생|선생님]] (“teacher”)? No, there is no subject.  In Korean, if the subject of the next sentence is understood, it can be omitted.  This is often found in colloquial English: 

:English speaker A: &quot;I'm a little busy.&quot;
:English speaker B: &quot;Oh, studying today?&quot;

However, in Korean, you can omit the subject more freely than English, and sometimes other elements can also be omitted, resulting in very short sentences.  Well, if 선생님 (&quot;teacher&quot;) isn't the subject, what is it?  It's the direct object!

{| border=solid
|-align=center style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;
| 선생[[wikt:님|님]] || [[wikt:을|을]]
|-align=center
| teacher || (direct object)
|}

The particle 을 is used to designate the direct object of the sentence, i.e. the thing or person upon which the action is happening.  In most textbooks, this is usually denoted as &quot;을/를&quot; because &quot;을&quot; comes after words ending in a consonant, and &quot;를&quot; comes after words in a vowel.  This particle is omitable, but for the beginner, it's best left in so nothing gets confused.

Now, based on what we have learned so far, one might guess that the verb stem of the verb in this sentence is &quot;만나겠다&quot;, which is a perfectly logical guess, but wrong.  The actual verb stem is &quot;만나다&quot; which means &quot;to meet&quot; (as you might have gleaned from the previous paragraph).  The &quot;겠습니다&quot; or, more correctly &quot;겠다&quot; is the future tense form.  For this form, it is unimportant whether the verb stem ends in a consonant or vowel.  Simply add &quot;겠&quot; and then finish off with &quot;습니다&quot; to speak politely.  Easy as 파이, no?

: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''아니요, 공부하겠습니다. 조새프는 오늘 숙제를 하겠습니까?'''&lt;/big&gt;

{| border=solid
|-align=center style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;
| 아니요, || || 공부하겠습니다. || 조새프는 || 오늘 || 숙제를 || 하겠습니까?
|-align=center
| No, ||  (I) || will study. || Joseph (topic) || today || homework (direct object) || will do?
|}

This sentence may sound a little strange, but it is nonetheless correct.  [[wikt:공부하다|공부하다]] means &quot;to study&quot;, [[wikt:오늘|오늘]] means &quot;today&quot; and [[wikt:숙제|숙제]] means &quot;homework.&quot;  [[wikt:하다|하다]] will be explained in more detail later, but for now, it means &quot;to do&quot; when by itself.  Notice the [[wikt:를|를]] on [[wikt:숙제|숙제]]? What is he doing? his homework!

: 조새프: &lt;big&gt;'''네, 저는 집에서 하겠습니다.'''&lt;/big&gt;

{| border=solid
|-align=center style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;
| 네, || 저는 || 집 || 에서 || 하겠습니다.
|-align=center
| Yes, || I (topic) || home || (at) || will do.
|}

Finally, we have another particle, [[wikt:에서|에서]], which is translated &quot;from&quot; or &quot;at&quot;.  In this case, it functions as &quot;at&quot;.  Notice &quot;Yes, I will do it at home.&quot;

: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''그래요.  안녕히 가십시요.'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조새프: &lt;big&gt;'''안녕히 가십시요.'''&lt;/big&gt;

[[wikt:그러다|그래요]] is a polite way of saying &quot;okay.&quot; It also means &quot;Yes that's right.&quot;

==Korean sentence order==

Korean sentences have a different word order from English.  Whereas an English sentence typically has a Subject-Verb-Object word order, a Korean sentence typically has a [[w:Subject Object Verb|Subject-Object-Verb]] word order.  For sentences with only a subject and a verb, Korean and English word order is essentially identical:

{|
|-
| rowspan=2 | Korean:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | 철수는
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | 먹는다.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
|-
| rowspan=2 | English:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Cholsu
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | eats.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
|}

If a sentence includes an object, the English and Korean order differs:

English:  I am reading a book.
English:  I(subject) am reading(verb) a book(object)

Korean:  저는 책을 읽고 있습니다.
Korean:  저는(subject) 책을(object) 읽고 있습니다(verb).

{|
|-
| rowspan=2 | Korean:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | 철수는
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | 사과를
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | 먹는다.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | object
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
|-
| rowspan=2 | English:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Cholsu
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | eats
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | the apple.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | object
|}

===Predicates===
A more complete understanding of Korean sentence order requires an understanding of Korean predicates ([[wikt:서술|서술]]부어).  As in English, complete Korean sentences must have a predicate that contains a conjugated Korean word ([[wikt:용언|용언]]).  Also as in English, Korean verbs ([[wikt:동사|동사]]) are conjugated and so can be sentence predicates.  However, with regard to forming sentences, Korean differs from English in two important ways: 
# Korean sentences do not require subjects ([[wikt:주어|주어]]), just predicates.  (That is, a Korean sentence with only a predicate is grammatically complete.)
# Korean adjectives ([[wikt:형용사|형용사]]) can be conjugated and used as sentence predicates.

Korean sentences that include subjects, indirect objects, direct objects, and complements often arrange them in this order:

{|
|-
| rowspan=2 | Korean:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Subject ([[wikt:주어|주어]])
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | indirect object ([[wikt:간접|간접]] [[wikt:목적어|목적어]])
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | direct object ([[wikt:직접|직접]] [[wikt:목적어|목적어]])
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFC0FF&quot; | complement ([[wikt:보어|보어]])
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | predicate ([[wikt:서술|서술]]부어)
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | 철수는
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | 나에게
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | 사과를
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFC0FF&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | 준다.
|-
| rowspan=2 | English:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Cholsu
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | gives
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | me
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | the apple.
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFC0FF&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | predicate
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | indirect object
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | direct object
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFC0FF&quot; | complement
|}

Above is the usual word order in Korean, which is the order most easily understood by native speakers of Korean.  However, excluding the predicate (the verb), the placement of other words is not entirely relevant to the meaning of the sentence.  The following arrangements have the same meaning as the above example:
{|
|-
| rowspan=2 | Korean:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | 나에게
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | 사과를
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | 철수는
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | 준다.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | indirect object
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | direct object
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
|-
|
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | to me
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | the apple
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Cholsu
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | gives
|-
| rowspan=2 | Korean:
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | 철수는
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | 사과를
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | 나에게
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | 준다.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | subject
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | direct object
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | indirect object
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | verb
|-
|
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0E0FF&quot; | Cholsu
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFC0&quot; | the apple
| bgcolor=&quot;#E0FFE0&quot; | to me
| bgcolor=&quot;#FFE0E0&quot; | gives
|}

==  Automata Theory  ==

As per our discussion at [[Regular Expressions]], I have decided to create a new wikibook on the topic of automata theory. We can use this new book to serve as a foundational background behind regular expressions, so that we can talk about the advanced topics on that subject, without having to lay all the theoretical groundwork. Currently, this new book exists only as a preliminary outline [[User:Whiteknight/Automata Theory|HERE on my users page]]. Any comments or suggestions on this new outline would certainly be appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:22, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Franl. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Franl~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some thoughts on the questions posed... (perhaps this will become an 'answers' page in due course?)

'''Q1.'''  Think back to the ideas presented on '[[GCSE Science/Induction]]':  Increasing the speed of rotation is like moving the magnet in and out of the coil faster, so the waveform on the oscilloscope will be bigger in relation to the y-axis (larger voltage induced). However, since the rate of rotation is increased, the  frequency will also be greater, so the peaks will be closer together, hence correct answer is 'C'.

'''Q2.'''  Some typical sources of a.c. are the alternator on a car and the generator at a power station. Sources of d.c. include dry cells (commonly known as 'batteries' in the UK), photovoltaic cells (solar panels), lead-acid accumulators and smoothed d.c. power supplies found in science labs.

'''Q3.'''  A typical device which only works with d.c. is (as mentioned in the article - if you were paying attention!) the electric motor (the split-ring commutator type depicted in the article about [[GCSE Science/The motor effect|the motor effect]]). A device which doesn't mind whether you use a.c. or d.c. is the light bulb.

'''Q4.'''  Was this question put in as a red-herring, or a means of challenging brighter pupils?! Well, what did ''you'' make of it? Tricky, given the setting? Well, since hair-dryers need to blow out a lot of hot air, their power requirement is fairly large. This means that batteries won't last long enough to be a viable option! With this in mind, the only sensible thing to do is use mains, i.e. alternating current. The heater element doesn't care which way the current is flowing - it just gets hot. This does pose a problem for the motor, though. It can't be the split-ring commutator variety, since it would just vibrate on the spot, get hot, and then die! (Electric motors invariably keep their windings from overheating by drawing in cooler air from outside their housing as they rotate.) So, one of those special a.c. motors mentioned earlier has to be used...  

'''Q5.'''  The useful component he was thinking of is called a 'diode'. [[Image:Diode_circuit_symbol.png]]


(Most diodes are now made from semiconductor materials, but the original diode was called a 'thermionic valve'. From your knowledge of Biology (particularly of the heart) why do you think the term 'valve' is appropriate?)

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Duplication problem with ''How to learn a language'' article==

There is a problem involving a duplication of the ''How to learn a language'' article that was originally on the en.wikipedia.

The article exists in two separate forms and appears to have been brought in twice:

* {{bad link|Transwiki:How_to_learn_a_language}}
* [[How to learn a language]]

Each has its own unique editing history. The one in the Transwiki domain is much more active. I would suggest the other version &lt;s&gt;has&lt;/s&gt; have its edits merged into the Transwiki version and then be deleted.

[[User:Oska|Oska]] 00:38, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)
:done. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:39, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:: Please correct me if I'm wrong but it appears that you have simply deleted the article under the Transwiki namespace and put in a redirect to the other version. If so that is not a good solution as the Transwiki version had been much more active and from memory (as the history page for that version has now disappeared) had about 30 edits made to it since being moved to wikibooks. The other version has only 3 edits made to it. My suggestion was for the articles to be merged, not for the (probably better) Transwiki version to be lost.

:: I would have done the merge myself but I was unsure if I had completely understood what had happened. I have been trying to find out what the protocol is for bringing stuff into wikibooks and what went wrong in this case. I can't do the merge now because it appears one of the versions has been lost.

:: The transwiki namespace seems to be problematic in allowing an article to be unintentionally forked like this. Why not just move the article into its normal title right from the start?

::[[User:Oska|Oska]] 08:41, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I guess I will have to type in text to make this test work.  Apologies.  --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 06:01, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

== A bit confused ==

I have copied and pasted [[w:User:Endgame1/AutoCAD Layers]] to [[Transwiki:AutoCAD Layers]].  But even though [[w:Help:Import]] tells me that this is not enabled on Wikimedia wikis, it seems that there is a way to import with the history intact.  Also there seems to be just one person doing all the transwikis.  Can someone point me in the right direction of what I'm meant to be doing.--[[User:Konstable|Konstable]] 01:10, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:Well, [[Special:Import]] doesn't work on Wikimedia wikis by default. However, things at the English Wikibooks are almost never the default. The developers enabled the import function here a few weeks ago. As stated in the Help page you found, only an admin can perform an import. I'll go see if I can remember how to import a file for you. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 10:32, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

::Yup, that was as easy as I remember, and I still managed to screw it up. The imported page with its history (and talk page) are at [[Transwiki:Endgame1/AutoCAD Layers]] and [[Transwiki talk:Endgame1/AutoCAD Layers]]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 10:38, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:::You didn't screw it up, it was just confusing because someone on wp had userified the article. I hadn't imported it yet because (a) the userifying made it a pain in the butt, and (b) totally forgot about it. It just needs to be moved to the nonuserified name... will do now. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:09, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

::Sorry, I didn't make that clear. I had to import it twice, as the first time, I imported the talk page over the content page. I fixed it with a speedy delete and re-import of the pages, which is still pretty easy. Even with having to do it twice, it's faster than the old copy-paste transwiki process. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:23, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Puh, yeah, no kiddin! But next time don't speedy, just move it to Transwiki_talk and then re-import :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:33, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Verb Conjugation==
{| align=&quot;right&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
*Infinitive: -i
*Present: -as
*Past: -is
*Future: -os
*Command: -u
*Conditional: -us
|}
In lesson 1, we learned that the base form of a verb — the ''infinitive'', which ends in '''-i''' — is translated &quot;to ''verb''&quot;. The present tense of any Esperanto verb ends in '''-as''' and is translated &quot;I verb&quot;, &quot;I am verb'ing&quot;, or &quot;I do verb&quot;. Note that &quot;I&quot; is only an example and can be replaced with anything.

Now we will learn the future and past tenses, the command form of a verb, and even how to form verbs that lack tense altogether.

;Future Tense:The future tense is formed by replacing the '''-i''' ending of the infinitive with '''-os'''. These can be translated &quot;I will verb&quot; or &quot;I will be verb'ing&quot;.
;Past tense:The past tense is formed by replacing the '''-i''' ending of the infinitive with '''-is'''. These can be translated &quot;I did verb&quot; or &quot;I verb'ed&quot;.
;Imperative:The imperative is the form one would use when they are telling somebody what to do, and is therefore sometimes called the command form. For example, in the sentence &quot;Bob, please '''run''' to the store&quot;, &quot;run&quot; is an imperative. In Esperanto, these are formed by replacing the '''-i''' of the infinitive with '''-u'''.
;Conditional:This form is used when a verb lacks a tense and refers to something that could potentially happen or have happened, and it is not really a tense, as such. For example, &quot;Bob '''would run''' if Jim '''were to tell him'''.&quot; Bob may not have run yet, and Jim has not necessarily asked him to. All we know is that Bob ''would'' run if Jim ''would'' tell him to. Esperanto has no word for &quot;would&quot;, but the meaning of it is reached by replacing the '''-i''' of the infinitive with '''-us'''.

These are all the forms of the '''active voice''', that is, when the subject is the one &quot;doing the verb&quot;. The '''passive voice''', when the subject is &quot;being verb'ed&quot; by something else, will be covered later.

Be sure to memorize the &quot;theme vowels&quot; for each tense: '''a''' for the present, '''o''' for the future, and '''i''' for the past.

==Participles==
Participles are adjectives formed from verbs, and are used to describe somebody who did, is doing, or will do a verb. The English language has two types of participles: the present active participle and the past passive participle.
*The present active participle is an adjective describing somebody who is doing something in the present. For example, &quot;The '''running boy''' will soon arrive home.&quot; &quot;Running&quot; is a participle.
*The past passive participle describes somebody who, at some time in the past, had the verb done to them by something else. For example, &quot;The '''torn and crumpled paper''' was thrown in the trash.&quot; The paper is torn because, in the past, somebody tore it, and it's crumpled for the same reason. In English, the passive participle usually looks the same as the past form of the verb, as is the case with &quot;crumpled&quot; (&quot;he crumpl'''ed''' it&quot;, &quot;it is crumpl'''ed'''&quot;), but not for &quot;torn&quot; (&quot;he tor'''e''' it&quot;, &quot;it is tor'''n'''&quot;).

Esperanto, however, has '''''eight''''' participles. Since English only has two participles, these don't always have perfect translations. Take a look at the table of forms below. If not already obvious, they are formed by replacing the final '''-i''' of the infinitive with these forms. Those in yellow exist in English, the rest have imperfect translations.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! !! Present !! Past !! Future !! Conditional
|-
|Active ||style=&quot;background-color:#FFFF99&quot;| -anta&lt;br/&gt;(verb'ing) || -inta&lt;br/&gt;(was-verb'ing) || -onta&lt;br/&gt;(will-be-verb'ing) || -unta&lt;br/&gt;(would-be-verb'ing)
|-
|Passive || -ata&lt;br/&gt;(being-verb'ed) ||style=&quot;background-color:#FFFF99&quot;| -ita&lt;br/&gt;(verb'ed) || -ota&lt;br/&gt;(will-be-being-verb'ed) || -uta&lt;br/&gt;(would-be-verb'ed)
|}

Because four of the participles have imperfect translations, they will have to be rephrased when translated into English.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Esperanto !! Rough English (as in gloss) !! Rephrased English
|-
| Knabo kurinta falos. || The ''was-running'' boy will fall. || The boy ''who was running'' will fall.
|-
| Arbo haketota alta estas. || The ''will-be-being-chopped'' tree is tall. || The tree ''which will be chopped down'' is tall.
|}

At the same time, the English sentence &quot;The tree which will be chopped down is tall.&quot; can be translated &quot;Arbo haketota alta estas.&quot; instead of the more literal &quot;Arbo, kiu estos haketata, alta estas.&quot;

==Asking and Answering Questions==
Asking questions in Esperanto is very easy to accomplish with the help of a few question words.

===Yes/No Questions===
====Asking Yes/No Questions====
In Esperanto, all questions that require &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; as an answer begin in &quot;Ĉu&quot;; no other change is made to the sentence. For example, &quot;Do you eat?&quot; would be said &quot;Ĉu vi manĝas?&quot;.

In English, &quot;It is a dog.&quot; would be asked &quot;Is it a dog?&quot;. You may notice that the only change is that &quot;it&quot; and &quot;is&quot; switch places. This is not true of Esperanto: all you have to do is put &quot;Ĉu&quot; at the beginning of the sentence. That's it. (&quot;Ĉu ĝi estas hundo?&quot; means &quot;Is it true that it is a dog?&quot; or more simply &quot;Is it a dog?&quot;.)

====Answering Yes/No Questions====
Answering Yes/No questions is very easy: &quot;jes&quot; means &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;ne&quot; means &quot;no&quot;.

===Other Types of Questions===
Here is a list of several basic question words:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Vocabulary / Vortlisto
|-
! Esperanto !! English
|-
| Kiu? || Which?/Who? (Which person?)
|-
| Kio? || What?
|-
| Kiam? || When?
|-
| Kie? || Where?
|-
| Kial? || Why? (For what reason?)
|-
| Kiel? || How?
|-
| Kiom? || How many?
|}

These words may be useful in answering questions that use the above words:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Vocabulary / Vortlisto
|-
! Esperanto !! English
|-
| Tiu || That/That person
|-
| Tio || That (thing)
|-
| Tiam || Then
|-
| Tie || There
|-
| Tial || For that reason
|-
| Tiel || Thus/In that way
|-
| Tiom || That many
|}

Notice how all these words are linked to the question word that has same ending. This system of words, called the correlatives, will be dealt with in a later chapter.

*Woman: There, next to ''my'' luggage.
*Ludwig: That's strange. If I had money, I would pay you. Thank you, miss, and goodbye!
*''Ludwig returned to his wife.''&lt;ref&gt;In Esperanto, &quot;his wife&quot; appeared in the accusative case, &quot;lian edzinon&quot;. Destinations and directions can appear in the accusative rather than with a preposition.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Wife: Ludwig! Do you have my luggage?
*Ludwig: Yes, it was returned to me by a good woman.

The 'o' in dot and the 'o' in or seem to be different o's
*The 'o' in dot is the correct sound. --[[User:Gabriel Beecham|Gabriel Beecham]] 00:30, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Why does the U first have an accent in the beginning of the article and further down an umlaut?15:37, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

== Audio ==

I'm making recordings of all the sample Esperanto words. I'm almost done, but I want to clear something up before I finish: I'm not sure ''ĝojo'' is such a great example for the ''oj'' diphthongs. When the noun ending is added, a syllable break will usually be inserted, and the word typically sounds like ''ĝo-jo'', unless I force it. Hovever, any plural noun should do the job, so I'll change it to ''lingvoj'' (languages) unless there are any objections. I hope this will be clearer, and I'll be back soon with my finished recordings. --[[User:WurdBendur|WurdBendur]] 05:59, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

== Ought to change ==

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Esperanto/Appendix_A&amp;oldid=773351 Ref]
(Post-edit notice) The 'o' sound in the main table states ''o as in French m'''o'''t or o as in Spanish n'''o''''', but I don't speak French or Spanish. From what I gather, this would be the sound of o as in &quot;cord&quot; or &quot;sorry&quot;, and I think this being an English Wikibook it would be best to include English examples for all instructive content. ~Jafet 11:22, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

Near the end in the diphthongs section you mention the pronunciation of 'boy' for one digraph and then 'buoy' for another. To people who are from the UK (like me) this is confusing because we pronounce both words exactly the same (with that 'oy' sound) but I know that Americans pronounce each differently. It might help to mention that on the page to stop us Brits getting confused!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter is an overview of [[Electronics/Resistors|resistors]] and their practical concerns.  Resistors are fundamental building blocks of amateur radio, being used for current limiters, voltage dividers, oscillators, filters and more.

==Resistors==
*Resistors, generally speaking, resist the flow of electricity.  They prevent some electrons from travelling through them.  This means that current flow is reduced.  Almost all materials have resistance (some, such as [[Wikipedia:Superconductors|superconductors]], have zero resistance.)  
*At an atomic level, resistors oppose the flow of electrons.  Some compounds have only a moderate hold on their electrons.  Thus, electricity can flow, but with less energy.  These compounds are said to have a high [[Wikipedia:Electrical Resistance|resistance]].  Copper has a very loose hold on some of its electrons, which can consequently have its electrons dislodge with very little energy.  Thus, copper has a low resistance.
*The unit of resistance is the Ohm, named after [[Wikipedia:Georg Ohm|Georg Ohm]].  An Ohm is the unit of resistance that will allow one Ampere to flow if an [[Wikipedia:EMF|electromotive force]] of one Volt is applied.  The symbol for an Ohm is a capital omega (Ω).

==Practical Resistors==
Two important things to know about resistors when using them are their schematic symbols and the resistor color code.  

[[Image:fixedres.png|frame|left|A Fixed Resistor]]

[[Image:3termvarres.png|frame|left|A Three Terminal Potentiometer]]

*Fixed resistors, as the name implies have a fixed resistance.
*Potentiometers have a variable resistance
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;

===The Resistor Value Color Code===
[[Image:Resistor-Codes.svg|350px]]

A resistor generally has four color bands.  The first two bands give the first two digits e.g. brown, black represents &quot;10&quot;.  The third band indicates the multiplier.  This is merely the number of zeros you add to the end of the first two digits.  For example, black, brown, red represents &quot;10&quot; &quot;00&quot;, or &quot;1000 Ω&quot; or &quot;1 kΩ&quot;.

==Construction Techniques==

There are three main construction techniques used in making resistors: wirewound, carbon composition, and metal film.

*Wirewound
**As explained in this book about [[Electronics/Resistors|resistors]], the narrower a conductor, the higher its resistance.  Also, the longer it is, the higher its resistance.  Combining these two characteristics, a wirewound resistor consists of a long, thin wire wrapped in a coil.  This creates a high resistance.
**'''Pros'''
***Can be made to very close tolerances (tolerance is how close the actual value is to the listed value)
***High power handling capability
**'''Cons'''
***Bulky
***Expensive
***Highly [[Electronics/Inductors|inductive]]

*Carbon Composition
**This resistor consists of a carbon powder in a container with wires attached to it.  Its resistance can be changed when manufactured by using different concentrations of carbon in the powder.
**'''Pros'''
***Very cheap
***Non-inductive
**'''Cons'''
***Poor tolerance
***Poor stability (i.e. the value of the resistor can change considerably with time)

*Metal Film
**This resistor consists of a container with a thin metal film on it.  Its resistance at manufacture can be changed by etching the metal away in certain patterns.
**'''Pros'''
***Inexpensive
***Non-inductive
**'''Cons'''
***If stressed beyond their limits, metal film resistors tend to stop conducting entirely rather than have their resistance changed.  This is often a benefit, as in some cases no operation is preferable to unpredictable operation.


==Ohm's Law==

Ohm's Law a fundamental principle in electronics.  The law states the relationship between electromotive force, current and resistance. Knowing any two of these allows the third one to be discovered. It is expressed as &quot;E = IR&quot;, where E is the electromotive force in Volts, I is the current in Amperes, and R is the resistance in Ohms.    

Consider the following two examples.

===Examples===
&lt;br&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|style=&quot;background:#AAAAAA&quot;|You are wiring a motor to a 12 V battery.  The only wire you have is rated for 10 A.  If the motor has a resistance of 1Ω:&lt;br&gt;1. What will the current be?&lt;br&gt;2. Will you be able to use the wire you have?
|}

''Answer:''  
#The voltage and resistance are known.  The current must be found.  From Ohm's Law, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I} = \frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{R}} = \frac{12 \mathrm{V}}{1 \Omega} = 12 \mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt;
#No.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|style=&quot;background:#AAAAAA&quot;|A circuit requires a current of 2.5 mA.  If the circuit is powered by a 5 V battery, what must the resistance be?
|}

''Answer:''

From Ohm's Law, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R} = \frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{I}} = \frac{5 \mathrm{V}}{2.5 \mathrm{mA}} = 2 \mathrm{k\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice in this case that milliamps were used instead of Amps.  We are allowed to do this because we used kilohms as the unit of resistance ( 1 mA = 0.001 A).

==Series and Parallel Combinations of Resistors==

[[Image:Seriesmeasure.png|center|Resistors in Series]]

This image shows a schematic of two resistors in series.  This is a series arrangement because the resistors are aligned head to tail; the current going through one resistor goes through both.  The two most important aspects of this circuit are


#&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot} = I_1 = I_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot} = E_1 + E_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total current and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total voltage''

The current and voltage equations are determined from [[Wikipedia:Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's laws]].  

[[Image:Parmeasure.png|center|Resistors in Parallel]]

This image shows a schematic of two resistors in parallel.  This is a parallel arrangement because the tails of the resistors are connected to each other and the heads are connected to each other.  The two most important aspects of this circuit are:

#&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot} = E_1 = E_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot} = I_1 + I_2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total current and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}}&lt;/math&gt; is the total voltage''

Once again, the current and voltage equations are determined from Kirchhoff's laws.

===Effective Resistance of Series and Parallel Combinations===

The effective resistance of combinations of resistors can be determined by Ohm's Law.  In the serial case, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}} = \sum_n{E_n}&lt;/math&gt; , while &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot}}=\mathrm{I}_n&lt;/math&gt; for all n.  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}_n=I\times \mathrm{R}_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}} = \sum_n{I\times R_n} = I\sum_n{R_n}&lt;/math&gt;.  Dividing voltage by current gives resistance, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{tot} = \sum_n{R_n}&lt;/math&gt; .

In the parallel case, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot}} = \sum_n{I_n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}}=\mathrm{E}_n&lt;/math&gt; for all n.  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{tot}= {\mathrm{E_\mathrm{tot}} \over \mathrm{I_\mathrm{tot}}} = {\mathrm{E} \over {\sum_n{\mathrm{E} \over{\mathrm{R}_n}}}} = {1 \over {\sum_n{1 \over \mathrm{R_\mathrm{n}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Voltage Drops===

A voltage drop is the voltage across a component.  In the example of the two resistors in series above, the voltage drop across &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R_1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E_1}.&lt;/math&gt;  By changing the value of a resistor, the voltage drop across it can be changed, allowing a variable voltage to be created from a fixed voltage.

==Power==

Resistors restrict the flow of electricity.  However, the energy expended doing so must go somewhere.  In the case of resistors, the energy is radiated as heat.  This is what heats up the filament in a light bulb or the heating elements in a toaster.  There is a limit to how much power a resistor can dissipate safely.  As a rule, the bigger (in size) the resistor, the more power it can dissipate.

Power is measured in Watts (abbreviated W), with one Watt equal to one Joule per second.  In electronics, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{EI}.&lt;/math&gt;  This permits calculation of the power dissipated by a resistor.

#If voltage and current are known, then the power is simply their product.
#If voltage and resistance is known, then:
#: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{EI} = \mathrm{E} \times \frac{\mathrm{E}}{\mathrm{R}} = \frac{\mathrm{E^2}}{\mathrm{R}}.&lt;/math&gt;
#If current and resistance are known, then:
#:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} = \mathrm{EI} = \mathrm{IR} \times \mathrm{I} = \mathrm{{I^2}R}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The month of December holds one of the most celebrated holidays in the world. Although Christmas is extremely popular, do we really know the story behind this celebration? Indeed, many questions go unanswered when it comes to Christmas. Today we are going to explore those questions and answers. We are going to look into many controversial aspects of Christmas, including things such as dates, customs, and traditions, so join me in this marvelous exploration of Christmas.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Was Jesus born on December 25? ==
The Bible doesn't explicitly state the date of Jesus' birth, but it does give clues. Luke 2:8-14 speaks of shepherds living outdoor and tending to a flock of sheep. The text reads, &quot;And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.&quot; Scholars of the Bible have concluded that this would be an unlikely practice in the month of December, for the weather conditions would be too cold to live outside or tend to a flock of sheep.



_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Book of Luke tells us that John the Baptist was 6 months older than Jesus, [Luke 1:26]. The book also tells us when John was conceived so it is possible to approximate the time of John's birth...and that of Jesus. 

John's father, [[Wikipedia:Zechariah|Zechariah]], served as a priest in the division of [[Wikipedia:Abijah|Abijah]], [Luke 1:5]. His priestly duty entailed one week of temple service every year plus three more weeks during the three yearly festivals. 

His division was the eighth so his period of temple service began in the eighth week of the year, [I Chronicles 24:10]. The Hebrew year, being lunar, began in the spring around late March early April. The eighth week would then generally fall around the first of June the way we show the months of the year on our calendar.

[[Wikipedia:Luke|Luke]] 1:23-24 tells us that Elizabeth, John's mother, became pregnant right after [[Wikipedia:Zechariah|Zechariah]]'s service in the temple. This would have been mid June....approximately. This means that [[Wikipedia:John the Baptist|John the Baptist]] would have been born around mid March....or close to [[Wikipedia:Passover|Passover]]. Jesus would have been conceived in John's sixth gestational month by the [[Wikipedia:Holy Spirit|Holy Spirit]], [Luke 1:26] which would have been December....so Jesus would have been born around the middle of September. This event would have probably taken place about the time of the last [[Wikipedia:Hebrew|Hebrew]] Holiday of [[Wikipedia:Sukkot|Sukkot]],([[Wikipedia:Feast of Tabernacles|Feast of Tabernacles]]). Since everyone was expected to travel to Jerusalem for the three annual feasts this is probably the real reason why there was no room in the inn. 

During the Feast Days the normal population of Jerusalem, 120,000, would probably swell to well over 1,500,000 folks. This would not be the case in the Month of December as there were no annual Feast Days then. [[Wikipedia:Bethlehem|Bethlehem]], being a &quot;suburb&quot; of [[Wikipedia:Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] would likely fill up quickly with the overflow. This time would also be consistent with the shepherds still in the fields during September. The weather in [[Wikipedia:Israel|Israel]] during December can be quite cold so flocks are usually brought into shelter no later than the middle of October. 

The 25th of December date is not scriptural and as you can see by the above evidence is not likely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Another aspect of Christmas that receives much criticism is its traditions. Traditions such as kissing under [[Wikipedia:mistletoe|mistletoe]] are very popular, but have no biblical reference at all. Bill McLain wrote in his book, “There are many legends about mistletoe. One Scandinavian legend states that [[Wikipedia:Loki|Loki]], the god of destruction, killed [[Wikipedia:Baldur|Baldur]], the god of peace, by shooting him with an arrow made from mistletoe. Other gods and goddesses were saddened by Baldur’s death and asked that his life be restored, which it was. In appreciation, his mother [[Wikipedia:Frigga|Frigga]] hung up the mistletoe and promised to kiss all who passed under it. Because of this, mistletoe became the symbol of both forgiveness and love.” There are also a few other beliefs of mistletoe from around the world. During the [[Wikipedia:Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], people would hang mistletoe over doors and on their ceilings to scare off evil spirits and prevent witches from entering. In addition, there is an old superstition that if you place a twig of mistletoe under your pillow you will not have any nightmares.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is safe to say that the Christmas tree is one of the most recognized symbols of Christmas, yet the origins of the Christmas tree are not clear. There is a legend that Saint Boniface started the custom of the Christmas tree in Germany around the eighth century. It is said that Saint Boniface found a group of pagans worshipping an oak tree and became angry; consequently, he proceeded to cut down the Oak tree. Immediately a small fir tree is said to have sprouted from the middle of the oak stump and reached to the sky. Thus, [[Wikipedia:Saint Boniface|Saint Boniface]] told the onlookers that this would be their holy tree because it was evergreen, a symbol of everlasting life. 

Historically, an oak tree named ''Irminsul'' (meaning Great Pillar) was in fact [[Wiktionary:venerate|venerated]] by the [[Wikipedia:Saxon|Saxon]] tribes of Germany as the symbol of their chief god, [[Wikipedia:Tiu|Tiu]], also known as [[Wikipedia:Saxnot|Saxnot]].  Located in the vicinity of the modern town of [[Wikipedia:Goettingen|Goettingen]], the Irminsul was destroyed on the orders of the Frankish emperor [[Wikipedia:Charlemagne|Charlemagne]] during the late 8th century CE, as part of a military campaign to subdue the Saxons and convert them to Christianity.

Although many versions of the story exist, many authorities believe that the true origins come from ancient [[Wikipedia:Egypt|Egypt]]. Bill McLain writes, “On December 21, the shortest day of the year, ancient Egyptians decorated their homes with green palm branches to symbolize life’s triumph over death.” Before [[Wikipedia:Christianity|Christianity]], plants and trees that remained green throughout the year were believed to have special meaning for people in winter. Bill McLain continues explaining, “Romans used evergreens to decorate their homes during the winter festival of [[Wikipedia:Saturnalia|Saturnalia]], which honored [[Wikipedia:Saturn|Saturn]], the god of farming.” In addition, [[Wikipedia:Ancient Druids|Ancient Druids]], a member of an order of priests in ancient Gaul and Britain who appear in Welsh and Irish legend as prophets and sorcerers, were known to place evergreen branches over doors to frighten away evil spirits.

People decorate the trees with baubles and tinsel to make it look really pretty to impress guests.  Lights are put up outside houses as well to impress people in the cars driving past.

Hallo, 

ich habe das Modul [[Komplexe Zahlen]] in die deutschsprachigen Wikibooks übertragen. Wenn du dem Bild [[:Image:Komplex1.JPG]] und [[:Image:Komplex2 1.JPG]] noch eine Lizenzangabe hinzufügen könntest, könnte ich die Bilder auch kopieren. Würde mich freuen dich bald in der deutschsprachigen Wikibooks begrüßen zu können. Gruß -- [[User:Daniel B|Daniel]] 22:50, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Hallo,

:das Kästchen reicht leider nicht aus. Du musst nochmals explizit angeben, dass du die Bilder unter die GUN FDL stellst (ist zugegeben etwas verwirrend). Genaueres erfährst du unter [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Bilder]. Hier in den englischsprachigen Wikibooks ist dies etwas anders, da hier auch Bilder verwendet werden dürfen, die unter Fair – Use stehen. Diese sind allerdings weit eingeschränkter nutzbar als GNU FDL Bilder. Deshalb achten wir in den deutschsprachigen Wikibooks sehr darauf, dass die Bilder unter der GNU FDL oder Public Domain gestellt werden.

:Bei mir gab es keine Probleme den Kurs zu löschen. Hab das mal in den deutschsprachigen Wikibooks gemacht (ich hoffe ich hab nicht zuviel gelöscht bzw. das richtige gelöscht).

:Zu deiner Frage ob die Kurse auf deiner Seite interessant sind: Ich kann hier nur für die deutschsprachigen Wikibooks sprechen. Aber generell würde ich sagen: auf jeden Fall. Auf der Diskussionsseite solltest du dann noch einen Vermerk machen, dass du selbst der Autor bist und den Text unter die GNU FDL stellst (z.B. &quot;Ich selbst bin Autor dieses Kurses und stelle hiermit den Kurs unter die GNU FDL&quot; oder so ähnlich). Dies ist natürlich nur für die Kopie von (eigenen) Webinhalten ins Wikibooks notwendig.

:Beiträge solltest du nur auf den entsprechenden landessprachigen Wikibooks machen, da ansonsten beispielsweise jeder nach Beiträgen zu   [[komplexe Zahlen | komplexen Zahlen]] auf der deutschsprachigen Wikibooks sucht. Möglicherweise sind hier noch einige deutschsprachige Beiträge, die aber alle noch aus der Zeit vor der Auftrennung in die nationalen Wikibooks stammen, als es nur das internationale Projekt gab.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Franzjosefmehr. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Franzjosefmehr~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr”&gt;
This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">The standard Omelette shouldn't include any fillings. See [http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=omelette m-w.com].

:Right now we've got (at least) three Omelette recipes. Being an omelette purist is not the first thing I would worry about. [[User:The Grimm Ripper|Grimm]]

I think the omelette pages need to be revised. I propose one description (not recipe) of what an omelette is on the Omelette page (with a redirect from [[Cookbook:Omelet]]). Some short descriptions (with pictures, perhaps, like on the [[Cookbook:Melon]] page) of typical omelets, French, Japanese/Asian, Spanish and links to specififc recipes. What's described here seems like a french omelet, as does the [[Cookbook:Omelet]], so those two recipes should be merged into one French Omelet recipe (with soime additional info).
We should also decide on whether to use ''omelette'' or ''omelet''. ''Omelette'' is more popular according to google, but I think ''Omelet'' is better for non-french omelettes.

::Agreed re:centralizing this as a &quot;type&quot; of food. I'd almost like to suggest using the category page for this purpose. Since Omelette is more popular, it's probably the one we should use, but we should definitely have a redirect to the other.

A cache is a collection of duplicate data, where the original data is expensive to fetch or compute (usually in terms of access time) relative to the cache. In PHP caching is used to minimize page generation time. PHP basically has two main types of caching: 'output caching' and 'parser caching'. PHP 'output caching' saves a chunk of data somewhere that can later be read by another script faster than it can generate it. 'Parser caching' is specific feature. PHP is a scripting language and code is not compiled or optimized to a particular computer. Every PHP file must be parsed and that takes time. This type of time minimization is 'parser caching'.

==Parser caching==
===Include caching===
Example:

File:class.test.php

 &lt;?php
 class test{
  function hello(){
     echo &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;;
  }
 }
 echo &quot;Class loaded\n&quot;; ?&gt;

File:program.php

 &lt;?php
 require_once(&quot;class.test.php&quot;);
 $obj1 = new test;
 $obj1-&gt;hello();
 require_once(&quot;class.test.php&quot;);
 $obj2 = new test;
 $obj2-&gt;hello(); ?&gt;

output:

 Class loaded
 Hello world!
 Hello world!

===Array caching===
Example:

File:program.php

 &lt;?php
 global $sum_cache; 
 $sum_cache=array();
 function sum($nr){
  global $sum_cache;
  if($sum_cache[$nr])
   {
   echo &quot;sum(&quot;.$nr.&quot;)=&quot;.$sum_cache[$nr].&quot; from cache\n&quot;;
   return $sum_cache[$nr];
   }
  if($nr&lt;=0)
   {
   $sum_cache[$nr]=0;
   }
  else
   {
   $sum_cache[$nr]+=sum($nr-1)+$nr;
   }
  echo &quot;sum(&quot;.$nr.&quot;)=&quot;.$sum_cache[$nr].&quot; computed\n&quot;;
  return $sum_cache[$nr];
  }
 sum(3);
 sum(4);
 ?&gt;

output:

 sum(0)=0 computed
 sum(1)=1 computed
 sum(2)=3 computed
 sum(3)=6 computed
 sum(3)=6 from cache
 sum(4)=10 computed

===Session caching===

example:

file:program.php
 &lt;?php
 session_start();
 function find_my_name()
  {
  //perhaps some time-consuming database queries
  return &quot;Bill&quot;; 
  }
 if(isset($_SESSION[&quot;hello&quot;]))
  {
  echo &quot;cached\n&quot;;
  session_destroy();
  }
 else
  {
  echo &quot;computed\n&quot;;
  $_SESSION[&quot;hello&quot;]=&quot;My Name is &quot;.find_my_name().&quot;.\n&quot;;
  }
 echo $_SESSION[&quot;hello&quot;];
 ?&gt;

output:
 computed
 My Name is Bill.

output after refresh:
 cached
 My Name is Bill.

===Shared variables===
Example

file:program.php
 &lt;?php
 class test{
  var $list=array();
  function load_list()
   {
   //some less timeconsuming database querys
   $this-&gt;list[0][&quot;info&quot;]=&quot;small info nr 1&quot;;
   $this-&gt;list[1][&quot;info&quot;]=&quot;small info nr 2&quot;;
   $this-&gt;list[2][&quot;info&quot;]=&quot;small info nr 3&quot;;
   }
  function load_element_detail(&amp;$data){
   //some very timeconsuming database querys
   $data[&quot;big&quot;]=&quot;added big info, maybe structure of objects&quot;;
   }
  function get_element($nr){
   return $this-&gt;list[$nr];
   }
  function print_element($nr){
   echo &quot;\$this-&gt;list[&quot;.$nr.&quot;][\&quot;info\&quot;]=\&quot;&quot;.$this-&gt;list[$nr][&quot;info&quot;].&quot;\&quot;\n&quot;;
   echo &quot;\$this-&gt;list[&quot;.$nr.&quot;][\&quot;big\&quot;]=\&quot;&quot;.$this-&gt;list[$nr][&quot;big&quot;].&quot;\&quot;\n&quot;;
   }
  }
 $obj = new test;
 $obj-&gt;load_list();
 $obj-&gt;print_element(0);
 $element=&amp;$obj-&gt;get_element(0);
 $obj-&gt;load_element_detail($element);
 $obj-&gt;print_element(0);
 ?&gt;

output:

 $this-&gt;list[0][&quot;info&quot;]=&quot;small info nr 1&quot;
 $this-&gt;list[0][&quot;big&quot;]=&quot;&quot;
 $this-&gt;list[0][&quot;info&quot;]=&quot;small info nr 1&quot;
 $this-&gt;list[0][&quot;big&quot;]=&quot;added big info, maybe structure of objects&quot;

This can precede or even take place of the traditional &quot;你好&quot; greeting, and partially serves as an attention-getter. However, if the pronunciation of &quot;哎&quot; (aì) is stretched/lengthened, it may sound as if you are complaining about something, which uses the same word.

=== Vocabulary ===
* 嗨  / hài = hi
* 去  / qù = go
* 哪儿 （哪兒） / nǎr = where
* 图书馆 (圖書館） / túshūguǎn = library
* 再见 （再見 / zàijiàn = bye, goodbye (literally: see you again)

ich, Franzjosefmehr, Komplexe_Zahlen, weiss nicht, was mit den Lizenzen gemeint ist. Alle Bilder wurden von mir erzeugt und ich geben sie zum allgemeinen Gebrauch frei. Ich habe die Bilder nochmals &quot;hochgeladen&quot; und dabei das Lizenzkaestchen angehakt.

Am Ende meines Textes erscheint eine Testseite aus meinem Russisch-Kurs (http://geocities.com/franzjosefmehr), die ich gerne geloescht haette. Da sie aber auf der Edit-Page nicht erscheint, weiss ich nicht, was ich tun soll. Hast Du eine Idee?

Auf meiner Seite findest Du einige Kurse, die ich eventuell nach WikiPedia transportieren moechte. Schau doch mal, ob das interessant waere.

Ich bin ein lange pensionierter Oberstudienrat und wohne seit 8 Jahren in Brasilien.

Vielen  Dank fuer Deine Muehen, Franzjosefmehr

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Daniel B. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Daniel B~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''Cheddar cheese''' is a firm yellow cheese made from cow's milk. It is probably the most popular cheese in the United Kingdom and comes in a range of qualities from mass-produced sandwich filler and mousetrap bait to matured farmhouse cheese. Cheddar takes its name from a village in Somerset, England, but is now made throughout the world, particularly in English speaking areas.

'''Red Leicester''' is an orange coloured cow's milk cheese, originally from Leicestershire in England. It has a firm texture, which makes it suitable for grating, and it is a good choice for use in [[Cookbook:Cheese on Toast|cheese on toast]] or with a baked [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]. At its best, it has a slightly nutty taste.</text>

'''Cheese on toast''' - a simple concept but easy to get wrong. Thick cut [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] is your first requirement. Toast one side of it under a medium [[Cookbook:Grilling|grill]] (called a broiler in some regions of the world). While it's browning, grate some cheese. You need a firm fleshed, strong flavoured cheese. Lightly toast the other side of the bread, just enough to warm it, then spread the grated cheese over it. You can add pickles, finely chopped onion, or even some crushed walnuts at this stage. Grill (broil) the cheesy side of the bread until the cheese is bubbling and brown. Eat quickly, but be careful, as the cheese will be tongue-burningly hot!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi -- wikibooks is for textbooks, so I humbly suggest that this material might be better suited for an article in Wikipedia.  --[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 20:28, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Yes you are right, focusing on Christmas is too narrow. What I will do is create a book about Paganism, and add a chapter about how Paganism influences on western holidays. While I am at it, ill include other holydays that have pagan traits. --[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 00:32, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)
----

Zoohouse, I like your work here. Please keep up the great work. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 22:07, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:Thank you [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] :)

== Moving The Pagan Beliefs Surrounding Christmas ==

I have been thinking, maybe we should move this book to ''Pagan Beliefs Surrounding Western. Holidays''
What do you folks think? Any suggestions? --[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 03:47, 31 Dec 2004 (UTC)

==Nice work, why not Wikipedia==
To reiterate Waxmop's point, while your content is great, Wikibooks is just for textbooks. If this book covered how to celebrate Christmas the Pagan way, it then would be a textbook. But as it is now, it's just information on the subject. If you move your writing over to Wikipedia, more people will read it, as the encyclopedia is higher trafficked.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

----

But if I were to write showing how western holidays are based on pagan belifs, whouldn't it be a textbook? --[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 20:46, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

----

Sure, in some sense, any elaborate explanation of any subject could be considered a textbook.  So, under that definition, all material should be included in the wikibooks page.  However, in practice, the term textbook has taken on a particular meaning in the wikibooks context.  The most popular projects fit any of the following criteria:

* The work teaches you how to do something, like play a game, or speak a foreign language,
* The work is an alternative to textbooks used in some mainstream educational curriculum, like US history.

I don't see how your work fits either.  Meanwhile your work does look similar to the myriad paganism articles already under development on wikipedia.  You're more likely to attract other contributors there than here.  Nobody is going to force you to relocate, but you're going against the spirit of the site.  --[[User:Waxmop|Waxmop]] 21:54, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)


----

I dont seem to be able to find myriad paganism articles... Can you point me to the right direction? --[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 17:20, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)


----

This is what Wikipedia had to say about Wikibooks: &quot;The project is a collection of free textbooks, manuals, and other texts, with supporting book-based texts, that is written collaboratively on this website.&quot;

Wikibooks was opened so to &quot;bring education to humanity and reduce the costs and other limitations on learning materials.&quot; 
I dont see how I am going against the spirit of the site.
--[[User:Zoohouse|Zoohouse]] 17:38, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I say this could belong on both Wikipedia and wikibooks, however, this work would do much better on wikipedia due to popularity. It doesn't take much to transwiki anyway. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 00:32, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

[[Wikipedia:Christmas]] already has information on these pagan beliefs, including possibly some information not in this book. This book seems too long to move to Wikipedia, so I would keep at Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:03, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Wikipedia ==
Doesn't this belong on wikipedia?--[[User:Batjew|Batjew]] 01:07, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)
: No, it [[w:Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not|doesn't]] --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:05, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

== Fishy Morality ==

I removed this interpretation from Fishy Morality: &quot;Even a Mulla can be a Jewish mother.&quot; Does anyone know what this means? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:01, 7 December 2005 (UTC)
----
What the *bleep* do those interpretations add to this all? They flatten everything out in a very moralistic way. I say, get rid of 'em. (IP 130.89.xx.xxx)

:If you do not like the interpretations, try to add better ones. If we remove the interpretations, then we will need to move this page to a different wiki, because Wikibooks does not allow fiction. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:17, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

== What is this? ==

I am very confused with this page.  I caught it because it is one of the most heavily edited Wikibook modules on this project, yet it is not listed on any bookshelf, and the primary reference is on the VfD forum (in the archive).  If not for that, nor on a few user talk pages, this would have been an orphaned book module.  I very curious over how anybody has even found this page except through a Google search.

Since it survived a VfD already, I'm going to ask more politely to try and figure out what this is and why does it belong on Wikibooks?  Keep in mind that Wikibooks is not a web hosting service, and it seems as though this page is being maintained almost exclusively by a group totally outside of the Wikibooks community, although [[User:Kernigh]] does seem to be involved, as are a few other old-timers on Wikibooks.

In addition, because there are some others participating, if it were to be put on a bookshelf, where do you think it ought to go?  Literature?  Games (aka grouped together with [[Puzzles]] and [[Puzzles:Riddles|Riddles]])?  Religion?  All three?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:41, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

: As far as I can tell this is a collection of sayings by a religious figure together with annotations (thus making it unsuitable for Wikisource), but I may be wrong. So yes Religion is likely the correct category. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:44, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

:: Comment from [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]]: I have occasionally edited this module. I probably discovered it through [[Special:Recentchanges]], because editors tend to flood Recentchanges by editing it section-by-section. From what I know, Nasrudin is a fictitious figure, invented for the purpose of including him in jokes. It is intended for (educational) humour; Nasrudin does not seem to be particularily smart.

:: If this page only contained jokes, it would be all-fiction and outside [[WB:WIW|the scope of Wikibooks]]. However, it also contains random interpretations; there appear to be no established interpretations that one can site. This might invoke an obscure &quot;no original ideas&quot; clause in [[WB:WIW]], but somehow I think that was meant to apply to entire books or sections, such as a book inventing a new language or religion, not to applications of existing concepts such as [[Nasrudin]] or [[Bourne Shell Scripting]] or even [[Zoph]] (when software developers put their manual on Wikibooks). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:53, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

:: I am also confused by this page.  What is the source? As far as I can see, anybody can make up a story and attribute it here to Nasreddin.  This is unsupported nonsense.  There are several books of Nasreddin's stories (eg Houman Farzad), this mess is not one of them. I think it should be deleted, but for some reason it supposedly has survived while remaining inchoate.  Here's a parable: where there's smoke, there's fire.  This &quot;book&quot; should be deleted.[[User:Abitslow|Abitslow]] ([[User talk:Abitslow|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Abitslow|contribs]]) 20:01, 24 May 2014 (UTC)

== Interpretations? ==
Are these interpretation from Sufi philosophy? If so, could someone kindly direct us to a source pertaining to these Sufi interpretations?

Thanks,
amesoliman 17:18, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:Interpreting a Nasrudin story is kinda like interpreting a Zen koan. Or, to plagiarize the Tao, &quot;The Nasrudin story that can be interpreted is not a Nasrudin story.&quot; (See 'Guest of Honor' interpretations to view my attempt at a Nasrudin story interpretation in the spirit of Nasrudin.) But of course, this is just my interpretation of Nasrudin stories ... [[User:JohnElder|John Elder]] 11:04, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

== Needs Serious Cleaning Up ==

I'm now going to remove some of the obviously false interpretations (yes, I know, it's all relative and they're all equally valid - in theory). For example the one with the Jewish Mother, the whole story of the biker bar, &quot;you can't sing&quot; etc. Please supply me with a valid argument for NOT removing these ridiculous interpretations - Wikigeek at gmail, 2 september 2007

== Nasreddin ==

Not that I want to offend any Wikibookians by passing over their judgement for that of Wikipedians, but I was wondering if editors would accept moving this page to [[Nasreddin]]. That is the name Wikipedia has settled and I think [[w:Talk:Nasreddin#Title|their argument]] is good and valid. (That, and it's the name for the character I know from my childhood...) --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:20, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

Yes please, remove away.  The interpretations muddle the sharp wit of the stories themselves.  Let each his own interpretation find.  --jsleuth, 20:47, 12 June 2008</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This stage involves using the NADH molecules produced previously, along with electrons from reduced electron carriers, to from molecules of ATP.  In eukaryotes this process takes place in the mitochondria, while in oxygen tolerant prokaryotes it takes place in the cell membrane.  Some eukaryotic cells, such as red blood cells, do not have mitochondria and therefore cannot use the electron transport chain to produce energy.

In plant cells, energy is used from the sun to start chemical reactions which create ATP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''{{Data Structures/ChapNav}}

Computers can store and process vast amounts of data. Formal data structures enable a programmer to mentally structure large amounts of data into conceptually manageable relationships. 

Sometimes we use data structures to allow us to do more: for example, to accomplish fast searching or sorting of data. Other times, we use data structures so that we can do ''less'': for example, the concept of the stack is a limited form of a more general data structure.  These limitations provide us with guarantees that allow us to reason about our programs more easily. Data structures also provide guarantees about algorithmic complexity — choosing an appropriate data structure for a job is crucial for writing good software.

Because data structures are higher-level abstractions, they present to us operations on groups of data, such as adding an item to a list, or looking up the highest-priority item in a queue. When a data structure provides operations, we can call the data structure an '''abstract data type''' (sometimes abbreviated as ADT). Abstract data types can minimize dependencies in your code, which is important when your code needs to be changed. Because you are abstracted away from lower-level details, some of the higher-level commonalities one data structure shares with a different data structure can be used to replace one with the other.

Our programming languages come equipped with a set of built-in types, such as integers and floating-point numbers, that allow us to work with data objects for which the machine's processor has native support. These built-in types are abstractions of what the processor actually provides because built-in types hide details both about their execution and limitations.

For example, when we use a floating-point number we are primarily concerned with its value and the operations that can be applied to it. Consider computing the length of a hypotenuse:

   let ''c'' := sqrt(''a'' * ''a'' + ''b'' * ''b'')

The machine code generated from the above would use common patterns for computing these values and accumulating the result. In fact, these patterns are so repetitious that high-level languages were created to avoid this redundancy and to allow programmers to think about ''what'' value was computed instead of ''how'' it was computed.

Two useful and related concepts are at play here:
* '''Encapsulation''' is when common patterns are grouped together under a single name and then parameterized, in order to achieve a higher-level understanding of that pattern. For example, the multiplication operation requires two source values and writes the product of those two values to a given destination. The operation is parameterized by both the two sources and the single destination.
* '''Abstraction''' is a mechanism to hide the implementation details of an abstraction away from the users of the abstraction. When we multiply numbers, for example, we don't need to know the technique actually used by the processor, we just need to know its properties.

A programming language is both an abstraction of a machine and a tool to encapsulate-away the machine's inner details. For example, a program written in a programming language can be compiled to several different machine architectures when that programming language sufficiently encapsulates the user away from any one machine.

In this book, we take the abstraction and encapsulation that our programming languages provide a step further: When applications get to be more complex, the abstractions of programming languages become too low-level to effectively manage. Thus, we build our own abstractions on top of these lower-level constructs. We can even build further abstractions on top of those abstractions. Each time we build upwards, we lose access to the lower-level implementation details. While losing such access might sound like a bad trade off, it is actually quite a bargain: We are primarily concerned with solving the problem at hand rather than with any trivial decisions that could have just as arbitrarily been replaced with a different decision. When we can think on higher levels, we relieve ourselves of these burdens.

Each data structure that we cover in this book can be thought of as a single unit that has a set of values and a set of operations that can be performed to either access or change these values. The data structure itself can be understood as a set of the data structure's operations together with each operation's properties (i.e., what the operation does and how long we could expect it to take).

Big-oh notation is a common way of expressing a computer code's performance. The notation creates a relationship between the number of items in memory and the average performance for a function. For a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items, &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; indicates that a particular function will operate on the set &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times on average. &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the function always performs a constant number of operations regardless of the number of items. The notation only represents algorithmic complexity so a function may perform more operations but constant multiples of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are dropped by convention.

===The Node===
The first data structure we look at is the node structure. A node is simply a container for a value, plus a pointer to a &quot;next&quot; node (which may be &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;).

{{DS:ADT|Node&amp;lt;Element&amp;gt;|
&lt;tt&gt;'''make-node'''(Element ''v'', Node ''next''): Node&lt;/tt&gt;
:Create a new node, with ''v'' as its contained value and ''next'' as the value of the next pointer

&lt;tt&gt;'''get-value'''(Node ''n''): Element&lt;/tt&gt;
:Returns the value contained in node ''n''

&lt;tt&gt;'''get-next'''(Node ''n''): Node&lt;/tt&gt;
:Returns the value of node ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s next pointer

&lt;tt&gt;'''set-value'''(Node ''n'', Element ''v'')&lt;/tt&gt;
:Sets the contained value of ''n'' to be ''v''

&lt;tt&gt;'''set-next'''(Node ''n'', Node ''new-next''): Node&lt;/tt&gt;
:Sets the value of node ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s next pointer to be ''new-next''

All operations can be performed in time that is &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Examples of the &quot;Element&quot; type can be: numbers, strings, objects, functions, or even other nodes. Essentially, any type that has values at all in the language.}}

The above is an abstraction of a ''structure'':

   structure '''node''' {
     element value     ''// holds the value''
     node next         ''// pointer to the next node; possibly null''
   }

In some languages, structures are called ''records'' or ''classes''. Some other languages provide no direct support for structures, but instead allow them to be built from other constructs (such as ''tuples'' or ''lists'').

Here, we are only concerned that nodes contain values of some form, so we simply say its type is &quot;element&quot; because the type is not important. In some programming languages no type ever needs to be specified (as in dynamically typed languages, like Scheme, Smalltalk or Python). In other languages the type might need to be restricted to integer or string (as in statically typed languages like C). In still other languages, the decision of the type of the contained element can be delayed until the type is actually used (as in languages that support generic types, like C++ and Java). In any of these cases, translating the pseudocode into your own language should be relatively simple.

Each of the node operations specified can be implemented quite easily:

 ''// Create a new node, with v as its contained value and next as
 // the value of the next pointer''
 function '''make-node'''(''v'', node ''next''): node
   let ''result'' := new node {''v'', ''next''}
   return ''result''
 end
 
 ''// Returns the value contained in node n''
 function '''get-value'''(node ''n''): element
   return ''n''.value
 end
 
 ''// Returns the value of node n's next pointer''
 function '''get-next'''(node ''n''): node
   return ''n''.next
 end
 
 ''// Sets the contained value of n to be v''
 function '''set-value'''(node ''n'', ''v'')
   ''n''.value := ''v''
 end
 
 ''// Sets the value of node n's next pointer to be new-next''
 function '''set-next'''(node ''n'', ''new-next'')
   ''n''.next := ''new-next''
   return ''new-next''
 end

Principally, we are more concerned with the operations and the implementation strategy than we are with the structure itself and the low-level implementation. For example, we are more concerned about the time requirement specified, which states that all operations take time that is &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;. The above implementation meets this criteria, because the length of time each operation takes is constant. Another way to think of constant time operations is to think of them as operations whose analysis is not dependent on any variable. (The notation &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; is mathematically defined in the next chapter. For now, it is safe to assume it just means constant time.)

Because a node is just a container both for a value and container to a pointer to another node, it shouldn't be surprising how trivial the node data structure itself (and its implementation) is.

===Building a Chain from Nodes===
Although the node structure is simple, it actually allows us to compute things that we couldn't have computed with just fixed-size integers alone.

But first, we'll look at a program that doesn't need to use nodes. The following program will read in (from an input stream; which can either be from the user or a file) a series of numbers until the end-of-file is reached and then output what the largest number is and the average of all numbers:

 program(input-stream ''in'', output-stream ''out'')
   let ''total'' := 0
   let ''count'' := 0
   let ''largest'' := &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   
   while has-next-integer(''in''):
     let ''i'' := read-integer(''in'')
     ''total'' := ''total'' + ''i''
     ''count'' := ''count'' + 1
     ''largest'' := max(''largest'', ''i'')
   repeat
    
   println ''out'' &quot;Maximum: &quot; ''largest''
   
   if ''count'' != 0:
     println ''out'' &quot;Average: &quot; (''total'' / ''count'')
   fi
 end

But now consider solving a similar task: read in a series of numbers until the end-of-file is reached, and output the largest number and the average of all numbers that evenly divide the largest number. This problem is different because it's possible the largest number will be the last one entered: if we are to compute the average of all numbers that divide that number, we'll need to somehow remember all of them. We could use variables to remember the previous numbers, but variables would only help us solve the problem when there aren't too many numbers entered.

For example, suppose we were to give ourselves 200 variables to hold the state input by the user. And further suppose that each of the 200 variables had 64-bits. Even if we were very clever with our program, it could only compute results for &lt;math&gt;2^{64\cdot 200}&lt;/math&gt; different types of input. While this is a very large number of combinations, a list of 300 64-bit numbers would require even more combinations to be properly encoded. (In general, the problem is said to require ''linear space''. All programs that need only a finite number of variables can be solved in ''constant space''.)

Instead of building-in limitations that complicate coding (such as having only a constant number of variables), we can use the properties of the node abstraction to allow us to remember as many numbers as our computer can hold:

 program(input-stream ''in'', output-stream ''out'')
   let ''largest'' := &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   let ''nodes'' := null
   
   while has-next-integer(''in''):
     let ''i'' := read-integer(''in'')
     ''nodes'' := '''make-node'''(''i'', ''nodes'') ''// contain the value i,''
                                  ''// and remember the previous numbers too''
     ''largest'' := max(''largest'', ''i'')
   repeat
   println ''out'' &quot;Maximum: &quot; ''largest''
 
   ''// now compute the averages of all factors of largest''
   let ''total'' := 0
   let ''count'' := 0
   while ''nodes'' != null:
     let ''j'' := '''get-value'''(''nodes'')
     if ''j'' divides ''largest'':
       ''total'' := ''total'' + ''j''
       ''count'' := ''count'' + 1
     fi
     ''nodes'' := '''get-next'''(''nodes'')
   repeat
   if ''count'' != 0:
     println ''out'' &quot;Average: &quot; (''total'' / ''count'')
   fi
 end

Above, if ''n'' integers are successfully read there will be ''n'' calls made to '''make-node'''. This will require ''n'' nodes to be made (which require enough space to hold the ''value'' and ''next'' fields of each node, plus internal memory management overhead), so the memory requirements will be on the order of &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, we construct this chain of nodes and then iterate over the chain again, which will require &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; steps to make the chain, and then another &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; steps to iterate over it.

Note that when we iterate the numbers in the chain, we are actually looking at them in reverse order. For example, assume the numbers input to our program are 4, 7, 6, 30, and 15. After EOF is reached, the ''nodes'' chain will look like this:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DataStructuresLinkedListofN.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Such chains are more commonly referred to as ''linked-lists''. However, we generally prefer to think in terms of ''lists'' or ''sequences'', which aren't as low-level: the linking concept is just an implementation detail. While a list can be made with a chain, in this book we cover several other ways to make a list. For the moment, we care more about the abstraction capabilities of the node than we do about one of the ways it is used.

The above algorithm only uses the make-node, get-value, and get-next functions. If we use set-next we can change the algorithm to generate the chain so that it keeps the original ordering (instead of reversing it).

{{TODO|pseudocode to do so; also TODO; should probably think of compelling, but not too-advanced, use of set-value.}}

 program (input-stream ''in'', output-stream ''out'')
   let ''largest'' := &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   let ''nodes'' := null
   let ''tail_node'' := null
   
   while has-next-integer (''in''):
     let ''i'' := read-integer (''in'')
     if (''nodes'' == null)
       ''nodes'' := '''make-node'''(''i'', null) ''// construct first node in the list''
       ''tail_node'' := ''nodes'' ''//there is one node in the list=&gt; first and last are the same''
     else
       ''tail_node'' := '''set-next''' (''tail_node'', '''make-node''' (''i'', null)) ''// append new node to the end of the list
     ''largest'' := max(''largest'', ''i'')
   repeat
   println ''out'' &quot;Maximum: &quot; ''largest''
 
   ''// now compute the averages of all factors of largest''
   let ''total'' := 0
   let ''count'' := 0
   while ''nodes'' != null:
     let ''j'' := '''get-value'''(''nodes'')
     if ''j'' divides ''largest'':
       ''total'' := ''total'' + ''j''
       ''count'' := ''count'' + 1
     fi
     ''nodes'' := '''get-next'''(''nodes'')
   repeat
   if ''count'' != 0:
     println ''out'' &quot;Average: &quot; (''total'' / ''count'')
   fi
 end

===The Principle of Induction===
The chains we can build from nodes are a demonstration of the principle of mathematical induction:

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;'''Mathematical Induction'''&lt;br&gt;
# Suppose you have some property of numbers &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;
# If you can prove that when &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; holds that &lt;math&gt;P(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; must also hold, then
# All you need to do is prove that &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; holds to show that &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; holds for all natural &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

For example, let the property &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; be the statement that &quot;you can make a chain that holds &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; numbers&quot;. This is a property of natural numbers, because the sentence makes sense for specific values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;:

* you can make a chain that holds 5 numbers
* you can make a chain that holds 100 numbers
* you can make a chain that holds 1,000,000 numbers

Instead of proving that we can make chains of length 5, 100, and one million, we'd rather prove the general statement &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; instead. Step 2 above is called the '''Inductive Hypothesis'''; let's show that we can prove it:

* Assume that &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; holds. That is, that we can make a chain of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements. Now we must show that &lt;math&gt;P(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; holds.
* Assume &lt;code&gt;''chain''&lt;/code&gt; is the first node of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-element chain. Assume &lt;code&gt;''i''&lt;/code&gt; is some number that we'd like to add to the chain to make an &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; length chain.
* The following code can accomplish this for us:
 let ''bigger-chain'' := '''make-node'''(''i'', ''chain'')
* Here, we have the new number &lt;code&gt;''i''&lt;/code&gt; that is now the contained value of the first link of the &lt;code&gt;''bigger-chain''&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;''chain''&lt;/code&gt; had &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements, then &lt;code&gt;''bigger-chain''&lt;/code&gt; must have &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; elements.

Step 3 above is called the '''Base Case''', let's show that we can prove it:

* We must show that &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; holds. That is, that we can make a chain of one element.
* The following code can accomplish this for us:
 let ''chain'' := '''make-node'''(''i'', null)

The principle of induction says, then, that we have proven that we can make a chain of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements for all value of &lt;math&gt;n\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. How is this so? Probably the best way to think of induction is that it's actually a way of creating a formula to describe an infinite number of proofs. After we prove that the statement is true for &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt;, the base case, we can apply the inductive hypothesis to that fact to show that &lt;math&gt;P(2)&lt;/math&gt; holds. Since we now know that &lt;math&gt;P(2)&lt;/math&gt; holds, we can apply the inductive hypothesis again to show that &lt;math&gt;P(3)&lt;/math&gt; must hold. The principle says that there is nothing to stop us from doing this repeatedly, so we should assume it holds for all cases.

Induction may sound like a strange way to prove things, but it's a very useful technique. What makes the technique so useful is that it can take a hard sounding statement like &quot;prove &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;n\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and break it into two smaller, easier to prove statements. Typically base cases are easy to prove because they are not general statements at all. Most of the proof work is usually in the inductive hypothesis, which can often require clever ways of reformulating the statement to &quot;attach on&quot; a proof of the &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; case.

You can think of the contained value of a node as a base case, while the next pointer of the node as the inductive hypothesis. Just as in mathematical induction, we can break the hard problem of storing an arbitrary number of elements into an easier problem of just storing one element and then having a mechanism to attach on further elements.

===Induction on a Summation===
The next example of induction we consider is more algebraic in nature:

Let's say we are given the formula &lt;math&gt;\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and we want to prove that this formula gives us the sum of the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; numbers. As a first attempt, we might try to just show that this is true for 1
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(1)(1+1)}{2} = 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;,
for 2
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(2)(2+1)}{2} = 3 = 1 + 2&lt;/math&gt;,
for 3
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(3)(3+1)}{2} = 6 = 1 + 2 + 3&lt;/math&gt;
and so on, however we'd quickly realize that our so called proof would take infinitely long to write out! Even if you carried out this proof and showed it to be true for the first billion numbers, that doesn't nescessarily mean that it would be true for one billion and one or even a hundred billion. This is a strong hint that maybe induction would be useful here.

Let's say we want to prove that the given formula really does give the sum of the first n numbers using induction. The first step is to prove the base case; i.e. we have to show that it is true when n = 1. This is relatively easy; we just substitute 1 for the variable n and we get (&lt;math&gt;\frac{(1)(1+1)}{2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;), which shows that the formula is correct when n = 1.

Now for the inductive step. We have to show that if the formula is true for j, it is also true for j + 1. To phrase it another way, assuming we've already proven that the sum from 1 to (j) is &lt;math&gt;\frac{((j))((j)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, we want to prove that the sum from 1 to (j+1) is &lt;math&gt;\frac{((j+1))((j+1)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that those two formulas came about just by replacing n with (j) and (j+1) respectively.

To prove this inductive step, first note that to calculate the sum from 1 to j+1, you can just calculate the sum from 1 to j, then add j+1 to it. We already have a formula for the sum from 1 to j, and when we add j+1 to that formula, we get this new formula: &lt;math&gt;\frac{((j))((j)+1)}{2}+(j+1)&lt;/math&gt;. So to actually complete the proof, all we'd need to do is show that &lt;math&gt;\frac{((j))((j)+1)}{2}+(j+1) = \frac{((j+1))((j+1)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

We can show the above equation is true via a few simplification steps:


&lt;math&gt;\frac{((j))((j)+1)}{2}+(j+1) = \frac{((j+1))((j+1)+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{(j)(j+1)}{2}+j+1 = \frac{(j+1)(j+1+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{(j)(j+1)}{2}+\frac{2(j+1)}{2} = \frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{(j)(j+1)+2(j+1)}{2} = \frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{j^2+j+2j+2}{2} = \frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{j^2+3j+2}{2} = \frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2} = \frac{(j+1)(j+2)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Graphs==
A '''graph''' is a structure consisting of a set of arrays (also called dimensions) &lt;math&gt;\{v_1, v_2,\dots,v_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and a set of edges  &lt;math&gt;\{e_1, e_2,\dots,e_m\}&lt;/math&gt;.  An edge is a pair of vertices &lt;math&gt;\{v_i, v_j\}\ i,j \in \{1..n\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The two vertices are called the edge ''endpoints''.  Graphs are ubiquitous in computer science.  They are used to model real-world systems such as the Internet (each node represents a router and each edge represents a connection between routers); airline connections (each node is an airport and each edge is a flight); or a city road network (each node represents an intersection and each edge represents a block).  The wireframe drawings in computer graphics are another example of graphs. 

A graph may be either ''undirected'' or ''directed''.  Intuitively, an undirected edge models a &quot;two-way&quot; or &quot;duplex&quot; connection between its endpoints, while a directed edge is a one-way connection, and is typically drawn as an arrow.  A directed edge is often called an ''arc''.  Mathematically, an undirected edge is an unordered pair of vertices, and an arc is an ordered pair.  For example, a road network might be modeled as a directed graph, with one-way streets indicated by an arrow between endpoints in the appropriate direction, and two-way streets shown by a pair of parallel directed edges going both directions between the endpoints.  You might ask, why not use a single ''undirected'' edge for a two-way street.  There's no theoretical problem with this, but from a practical programming standpoint, it's generally simpler and less error-prone to stick with all directed or all undirected edges.

An undirected graph can have at most &lt;math&gt;\left (
   \begin{array}{c}
   n+1 \\ 2
   
   \end{array}
   \right )&lt;/math&gt; edges (one for each unordered pair), while a directed graph can have at most &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; edges (one per ordered pair).  A graph is called ''sparse'' if it has many fewer than this many edges (typically &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; edges), and ''dense'' if it has closer to &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; edges.  A '''multigraph''' can have more than one edge between the same two vertices.  For example, if one were modeling airline flights, there might be multiple flights between two cities, occurring at different times of the day.

A '''path''' in a graph is a sequence of vertices &lt;math&gt;\{ v_{i_1}, v_{i_2}, \dots , v_{i_k} \}&lt;/math&gt; such that there exists an edge or arc between consecutive vertices.  The path is called a '''cycle''' if &lt;math&gt;v_{i_1} \equiv v_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;.  An undirected acyclic graph is equivalent to an undirected tree.  A directed acyclic graph is called a '''DAG'''.  It is not necessarily a tree.

Nodes and edges often have associated information, such as ''labels'' or ''weights''.  For example, in a graph of airline flights, a node might be labeled with the name of the corresponding airport, and an edge might have a weight equal to the flight time.  The popular game &quot;[[w:Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon|Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon]]&quot; can be modeled by a labeled undirected graph. Each actor becomes a node, labeled by the actor's name. Nodes are connected by an edge when the two actors appeared together in some movie. We can label this edge by the name of the movie.  Deciding if an actor is separated from Kevin Bacon by six or fewer steps is equivalent to finding a path of length at most six in the graph between Bacon's vertex and the other actors vertex.  (This can be done with the breadth-first search algorithm found in the companion [[Computer_Science:Algorithms|Algorithms]] book. The Oracle of Bacon at the University of Virginia has actually implemented this algorithm and can tell you the path from any actor to Kevin Bacon in a few clicks[http://www.cs.virginia.edu/oracle/].)

===Directed Graphs===
[[Image:Directed.svg|125px|thumb|A directed graph.]]
The number of edges with one endpoint on a given vertex is called that vertex's '''degree'''. In a directed graph, the number of edges that point ''to'' a given vertex is called its '''in-degree''', and the number that point ''from'' it is called its '''out-degree'''.  Often, we may want to be able to distinguish between different nodes and edges. We can associate labels with either. We call such a graph '''labeled'''.

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''make-graph'''(): graph&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Create a new graph, initially with no nodes or edges.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''make-vertex'''(graph ''G'', element ''value''): vertex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Create a new vertex, with the given value.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''make-edge'''(vertex ''u'', vertex ''v''): edge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Create an edge between ''u'' and ''v''. In a directed graph, the edge will flow from ''u'' to ''v''.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''get-edges'''(vertex ''v''): edge-set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the set of edges flowing from ''v''&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''get-neighbors'''(vertex ''v''): vertex-set&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the set of vertices connected to ''v''&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

[TODO: also need undirected graph abstraction in that section, and also find a better set of operations-- the key to finding good operations is seeing what the algorithms that ''use'' graphs actually ''need'']
&lt;/div&gt;

===Undirected Graphs===
[[Image:Undirected.svg|thumb|125px|An undirected graph.]]
In a directed graph, the edges point from one vertex to another, while in an '''undirected graph''', they merely connect two vertices.
we can travel forward or backward.It is a bidirectional graph.

===Weighted Graphs===
We may also want to associate some cost or weight to the traversal of an edge. When we add this information, the graph is called '''weighted'''. An example of a weighted graph would be the distance between the capitals of a set of countries.

Directed and undirected graphs may both be weighted.  The operations on a weighted graph are the same with addition of a weight parameter during edge creation:
&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;Directed Graph Operations&quot;&gt;
'''Weighted Graph Operations (an extension of undirected/directed graph operations)'''
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;background:#FFFFEE&quot;&gt;'''make-edge'''(vertex ''u'', vertex ''v'', weight ''w''): edge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Create an edge between ''u'' and ''v'' with weight ''w''. In a directed graph, the edge will flow from ''u'' to ''v''.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

=== Graph Representations ===
==== Adjacency Matrix Representation ====
An '''adjacency matrix''' is one of the two common ways to represent a graph.  The adjacency matrix shows which nodes are '''adjacent''' to one another.  Two nodes are adjacent if there is an edge connecting them.  In the case of a directed graph, if node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, there is an edge from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, if &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is adjacent to &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, you can get from &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; by traversing one edge.  For a given graph with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes, the adjacency matrix will have dimensions of &lt;math&gt;n \times n&lt;/math&gt;.  For an unweighted graph, the adjacency matrix will be populated with boolean values.

For any given node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, you can determine its adjacent nodes by looking at row &lt;math&gt;\left( i , \left[ 1..n \right] \right)&lt;/math&gt; of the adjacency matrix.  A value of true at &lt;math&gt;\left( i , j \right)&lt;/math&gt; indicates that there is an edge from node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and false indicating no edge.  In an undirected graph, the values of &lt;math&gt;\left( i, j \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left( j, i \right)&lt;/math&gt; will be equal.  In a weighted graph, the boolean values will be replaced by the weight of the edge connecting the two nodes, with a special value that indicates the absence of an edge.

The memory use of an adjacency matrix is &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Adjacency List Representation====
The adjacency list is another common representation of a graph. There are many ways to implement this adjacency representation.
One way is to have the graph maintain a list of lists, in which the first list is a list of indices corresponding to each node in the graph. Each of these refer to another list that stores a the index of each adjacent node to this one. It might also be useful to associate the weight of each link with the adjacent node in this list.

Example:
An undirected graph contains four nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4. 1 is linked to 2 and 3. 2 is linked to 3. 3 is linked to 4.

1 - [2, 3]

2 - [1, 3]

3 - [1, 2, 4]

4 - [3]

It might be useful to store the list of all the nodes in the graph in a hash table. The keys then would correspond to the indices of each node and the value would be a reference to the list of adjacent node indices.

Another implementation might require that each node keep a list of its adjacent nodes.

=== Graph Traversals ===
In a perfect world we would have full knowledge of the graph's contents, letting us optimize indices for the vertices and edges for efficient look-ups. But there are numerous open-ended problems in computer science where indexing is impractical or even impossible. Graph traversals let us tackle these problems. The traversals let us efficiently search large spaces where objects are defined by their relationships to other objects rather than properties of the objects themselves.

==== Depth-First Search====
Start at vertex a, visit its neighbour b, then b's neighbour c and keep going until reach 'a dead end' then iterate back and visit nodes reachable from second last visited vertex and keep applying the same principle.


 [TODO: depth-first search -- with compelling example]

 // Search in the subgraph for a node matching 'criteria'. Do not re-examine 
 // nodes listed in 'visited' which have already been tested.
 GraphNode depth_first_search(GraphNode node, Predicate criteria, VisitedSet visited) {
  // Check that we haven't already visited this part of the graph
  if (visited.contains(node)) {
    return null;
  }
  visited.insert(node);
  // Test to see if this node satifies the criteria
  if (criteria.apply(node.value)) {
    return node;
  }
  // Search adjacent nodes for a match
  for (adjacent in node.adjacentnodes()) {
    GraphNode ret = depth_first_search(adjacent, criteria, visited);
    if (ret != null) {
      return ret;
    }
  }
  // Give up - not in this part of the graph
  return null;
 }

 Breadth-First Search 

Breadth first search visits the nodes neighbours and then the unvisited neighbours of the neighbours, etc. If it starts on vertex a it will go to all vertices that have an edge from a. If some points are not reachable it will have to start another BFS from a new vertex.

 [TODO: breadth-first search -- with compelling example]

{{TODO|queue implemented as an array: circular and fixed-sized}}

== Stacks and Queues ==
=== Stacks ===
A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought as linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack. The basic concept can be illustrated by thinking of your data set as a stack of plates or books where you can only take the top item off the stack in order to remove things from it. This structure is used all throughout programming.

The basic implementation of a stack is also called a LIFO (Last In First Out) to demonstrate the way it accesses data, since as we will see there are various variations of stack implementations.

There are basically three operations that can be performed on stacks . They are
1) inserting an item into a stack (push).
2) deleting an item from the stack (pop).
3) displaying the contents of the stack(pip).
{{clear}}
[[File:Data stack.svg]]

{{NOTE|Depending on the language and implementation the data structure may share the name with an abstract data type that support all of the data structure characteristics.}}

Below are some of operations a '''stack data type''' normally supports:
&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;Stack&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; Operations&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;code&gt;Stack&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; Operations'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''push'''(&lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adds an item onto the stack.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''top'''():item-type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the last item pushed onto the stack.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''pop'''()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes the most-recently-pushed item from the stack.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-empty'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if no more items can be popped and there is no top item.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-full'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if no more items can be pushed.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-size'''():Integer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the number of elements on the stack.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

All operations except &lt;code&gt;get-size()&lt;/code&gt; can be performed in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time. &lt;code&gt;get-size()&lt;/code&gt; runs in at worst &lt;math&gt;O(N).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


==== Linked List Implementation ====
The basic linked list implementation is one of the easiest linked list implementations you can do.  Structurally it is a linked list.
 type Stack&lt;item_type&gt;
   data list:Singly Linked List&lt;item_type&gt;
 
   constructor()
     list := new Singly-Linked-List()
   end constructor

Most operations are implemented by passing them through to the underlying linked list.
When you want to '''push''' something onto the list, you simply add it to the front of the linked list. The previous top is then &quot;next&quot; from the item being added and the list's front pointer points to the new item.
   method push(new_item:item_type)
     list.prepend(new_item)
   end method

To look at the '''top''' item, you just examine the first item in the linked list.
   method top():item_type
     return list.get-begin().get-value()
   end method

When you want to '''pop''' something off the list, simply remove the first item from the linked list.
   method pop()
     list.remove-first()
   end method

A check for emptiness is easy.  Just check if the list is empty.
   method is-empty():Boolean
     return list.is-empty()
   end method

A check for full is simple. Linked lists are considered to be limitless in size.
   method is-full():Boolean
     return False
   end method

A check for the size is again passed through to the list.
   method get-size():Integer
     return list.get-size()
   end method
 end type

A real Stack implementation in a published library would probably re-implement the linked list in order to squeeze the last bit of performance out of the implementation by leaving out unneeded functionality. The above implementation gives you the ideas involved, and any optimization you need can be accomplished by inlining the linked list code.

&lt;!-- Removed C++. Move this to appendix
Here is a C++ sample code for this:
 struct Stack_Element_T {
   int data;
   struct Stack_Element_t *next;
 };
 
 class Stack
 {
  public:
    Stack()
      {
       _top = NULL;
       _size = 0;
      }
    void push(int data);
    int pop(void);
    bool isEmpty(void)
      {
       return (_top == NULL);
      }
    bool isFull(void)
      {
       return false;
      }
    unsigned int getSize()
      {
       return _size;
      }
 
  private:
    Stack_Element_T *_top;
    unsigned int _size;
 };
 
 void Stack::push(int data)
 {
  Stack_Element_T *new_element;
 
  if(!_top){
    _top = new Stack_Element_T;
    _top-&gt;data = data;
    _top-&gt;next = NULL;
  }
  else{
    new_element = new Stack_Element_T;

===== Performance Analysis =====

In a linked list, accessing the first element is an &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; operation because the list contains a pointer that checks for empty/fullness as done here are also &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;.
depending on what time/space tradeoff is made. Most of the time, users of a Stack do not use the &lt;code&gt;getSize()&lt;/code&gt; operation, and so a bit of space can be saved by not optimizing it.

Since all operations are at the top of the stack, the array implementation is now much, much better. 

   public class StackArray implements Stack
   {
       protected int top;
       protected Object[] data;
       ...
   }

The array implementation keeps the bottom of the stack at the beginning of the array. It grows toward the end of the array. 
The only problem is if you attempt to push an element when the array is full. If so 

    Assert.pre(!isFull(),&quot;Stack is not full.&quot;);
will fail, raising an exception. 
Thus it makes more sense to implement with Vector (see StackVector) to allow unbounded growth (at cost of occasional O(n) delays). 

Complexity: 

All operations are O(1) with exception of occasional push and clear, which should replace all entries by null in order to let them be garbage-collected. Array implementation does not replace null entries. The Vector implementation does.

=== Applications of Stacks ===

[[File:Stack of books.jpg|thumb|Stack of books]]

Using stacks, we can solve many applications, some of which are listed below.










====Converting a decimal number into a binary number====
The logic for transforming a decimal number into a binary number is as follows:

     * Read a number
     * Iteration (while number is greater than zero)
               1. Find out the remainder after dividing the number by 2
               2. Print the remainder
               3. Divide the number by 2
     * End the iteration

However, there is a problem with this logic. Suppose the number, whose binary form we want to find is 23. Using this logic, we get the result as 11101, instead of getting 10111.

To solve this problem, we use a stack. We make use of the ''LIFO'' property of the stack. Initially we ''push'' the binary digit formed into the stack, instead of printing it directly. After the entire digit has been converted into the binary form, we ''pop'' one digit at a time from the stack and print it. Therefore we get the decimal number is converted into its proper binary form.

'''Algorithm:'''

    1. Create a stack
    2. Enter a decimal number, which has to be converted into its equivalent binary form.
    3. iteration1 (while number &gt; 0)
          3.1 digit = number % 2
          3.2 Push ''digit'' into the stack
          3.3 If the stack is full
               3.3.1 Print an error
               3.3.2 Stop the algorithm
          3.4 End the ''if'' condition
          3.5 Divide the number by 2
    4. End ''iteration1''
    
    5. iteration2 (while stack is not empty)
          5.1 Pop ''digit'' from the stack
          5.2 Print the ''digit''
    6. End iteration2
    7. STOP

====Towers of Hanoi====
[[Image:Tower of Hanoi.jpeg|300px|thumb|Towers of Hanoi]]
One of the most interesting applications of stacks can be found in solving a puzzle called Tower of Hanoi. According to an old Brahmin story, the existence of the universe is calculated in terms of the time taken by a number of monks, who are working all the time, to move 64 disks from one pole to another. But there are some rules about how this should be done, which are:
# You can move only one disk at a time.
# For temporary storage, a third pole may be used.
# You cannot place a disk of larger diameter on a disk of smaller diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dromey&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dromey|first=R.G|title=How to Solve it by Computer|publisher=Prentice Hall of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here we assume that  A is first tower, B is second tower  &amp; C is third tower.

The C++ code for this solution can be implemented in two ways:

=====First Implementation (Without using Stacks)=====
Here we assume that  A is first tower, B is second tower  &amp; C is third tower. (B is the intermediate)

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void TowersofHanoi(int n, int a, int b, int c)
{
    //Move top n disks from tower a to tower b, use tower c for intermediate storage.
    if(n &gt; 0)
    {
        TowersofHanoi(n-1, a, c, b);   //recursion
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot; Move top disk from tower &quot; &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; &quot; to tower &quot; &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; endl ;
        //Move n-1 disks from intermediate(b) to the source(a) back
        TowersofHanoi(n-1, c, b, a);   //recursion
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Data structures, Algorithms and Applications in C++ by Sartaj Sahni&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Second Implementation (Using Stacks)=====
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// Global variable , tower [1:3] are three towers
arrayStack&lt;int&gt; tower[4];
void TowerofHanoi(int n)
{
    // Preprocessor for moveAndShow.
    for (int d = n; d &gt; 0; d--)        //initialize
        tower[1].push(d);              //add disk d to tower 1
    moveAndShow(n, 1, 2, 3);           /*move n disks from tower 1 to tower 3 using 
                                       tower 2 as intermediate tower*/  
}

void moveAndShow(int n, int a, int b, int c)
{
    // Move the top n disks from tower a to tower b showing states.
    // Use tower c for intermediate storage.
    if(n &gt; 0)
    {
        moveAndShow(n-1, a, c, b);     //recursion
        int d = tower[x].top();        //move a disc from top of tower x to top of 
        tower[x].pop();                //tower y
        tower[y].push(d);
        showState();                   //show state of 3 towers
        moveAndShow(n-1, c, b, a);     //recursion
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

However complexity for above written implementations is O(&lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;). So it's obvious that problem can only be solved for small values of n (generally n &lt;= 30). 
In case of the monks, the number of turns taken to transfer 64 disks, by following the above rules, will be 18,446,744,073,709,551,615; which will surely take a lot of time!!

====Expression evaluation and syntax parsing====
Calculators employing [[W:reverse Polish notation|reverse Polish notation]] use a stack structure to hold values. Expressions can be represented in prefix, postfix or infix notations. Conversion from one form of the expression to another form may be accomplished using a stack. Many compilers use a stack for parsing the syntax of expressions, program blocks etc. before translating into low level code. Most of the programming languages are [[W:context-free grammar|context-free languages]] allowing them to be parsed with stack based machines.

=====Evaluation of Infix Expression which is not fully parenthesized=====

'''Input:''' (2 * 5 - 1 * 2) / (11 - 9)

'''Output:''' 4

'''Analysis:''' There are five types of input characters which are:
                * Opening brackets
                * Numbers
                * Operators
                * Closing brackets
                * New line character (\n)

We do not know what to do if an operator is read as an input character.
By implementing the priority rule for operators, we have a solution to this problem.

The ''Priority rule'' we should perform comparative priority check if an operator is read, and then push it. If the stack ''top'' contains an operator of prioirty higher than or equal to the priority of the input operator, then we ''pop'' it and print it. We keep on perforrming the prioirty check until the ''top'' of stack either contains an operator of lower priority or if it does not contain an operator.

====Rearranging railroad cars====
=====Problem Description===== 
It's a very nice application of stacks. Consider that a freight train has '''''n''''' railroad cars. Each to be left at different station. They're numbered 1 through n &amp; freight train visits these stations in order n through 1. Obviously, the railroad cars are labeled by their destination.To facilitate removal of the cars from the train, we must rearrange them in ascending order of their number(i.e. 1 through n). When cars are in this order , they can be detached at each station. We rearrange cars at a shunting yard that has '''''input track''''', '''''output track''''' &amp; '''''k''''' holding tracks between input &amp; output tracks(i.e. '''''holding track'''''). 

=====Solution Strategy=====
To rearrange cars, we examine the cars on the the input from front to back. If the car being examined is next one in the output arrangement , we move it directly to '''''output track'''''. If not , we move it to the '''''holding track''''' &amp; leave it there until it's time to place it to the '''''output track'''''. The holding tracks operate in a LIFO manner as the cars enter &amp; leave these tracks from top. When rearranging cars only following moves are permitted:
* A car may be moved from front (i.e. right end) of the input track to the top of one of the '''''holding tracks''''' or to the left end of the output track.
* A car may be moved from the top of '''''holding track''''' to left end of the '''''output track'''''.
The figure shows a shunting yard with '''''k''''' = 3, holding tracks '''''H1''''', '''''H2''''' &amp; '''''H3''''', also '''''n''''' = 9. The '''''n''''' cars of freight train begin in the input track &amp; are to end up in the output track in order 1 through '''''n''''' from right to left. The cars initially are in the order 5,8,1,7,4,2,9,6,3 from back to front. Later cars are rearranged in desired order.    

=====A Three Track Example===== 
[[File:Railroadcars2.png|thumb|Railroad cars example]]
*Consider the input arrangement from figure , here we note that the car 3 is at the front, so it can't be output yet, as it to be preceded by cars 1 &amp; 2. So car 3 is detached &amp; moved to holding track '''''H1'''''.
*The next car 6 can't be output &amp; it is moved to holding track '''''H2'''''. Because we have to output car 3 before car 6 &amp; this will not possible if we move car 6 to holding track '''''H1'''''.
*Now it's obvious that we move car 9 to '''''H3'''''.
The requirement of rearrangement of cars on any holding track is that the cars should be preferred  to arrange in ascending order from top to bottom. 
*So car 2 is now moved to holding track H1 so that it satisfies the previous statement. If we move car 2 to H2 or H3, then we've no place to move cars 4,5,7,8.'''''The least restrictions on future car placement arise when the new car λ is moved to the holding track that has a car at its top with smallest label Ψ such that λ &lt; Ψ. We may call it an assignment rule to decide whether a particular car belongs to a specific holding track.''''' 
*When car 4 is considered, there are three places to move the car H1,H2,H3. The top of these tracks are 2,6,9.So using above mentioned Assignment rule, we move car 4 to H2.
*The car 7 is moved to H3.
*The next car 1 has the least label, so it's moved to output track.
*Now it's time for car 2 &amp; 3 to output which are from H1(in short all the cars from H1 are appended to car 1 on output track).
The car 4 is moved to output track. No other cars can be moved to output track at this time.
*The next car 8 is moved to holding track H1.
*Car 5 is output from input track. Car 6 is moved to output track from H2, so is the 7 from H3,8 from H1 &amp; 9 from H3.


==== Quicksort ====

Sorting means arranging a group of elements in a particular order. Be it ascending or descending, by cardinality or alphabetical order or variations thereof.  The resulting ordering possibilities will only be limited by the type of the source elements. 

Quicksort is an algorithm of the ''divide and conquer'' type. In this method, to sort a set of numbers, we reduce it to two smaller sets, and then sort these smaller sets.

This can be explained with the help of the following example:

Suppose '''A''' is a list of the following numbers:

[[File:Quicksort1.pdf|500px]]

In the reduction step, we find the final position of one of the numbers. In this case, let us assume that we have to find the final position of 48, which is the first number in the list.

To accomplish this, we adopt the following method. Begin with the last number, and move from right to left. Compare each number with 48. If the number is smaller than 48, we stop at that number and swap it with 48.


In our case, the number is 24. Hence, we swap 24 and 48.

[[File:Quicksort2.pdf|500px]]

The numbers 96 and 72 to the right of 48, are greater than 48.  Now beginning with 24, scan the numbers in the opposite direction, that is from left to right. Compare every number with 48 until you find a number that is greater than 48. 

In this case, it is 60. Therefore we swap 48 and 60.

[[File:Quicksort3.pdf|500px]]

Note that the numbers 12, 24 and 36 to the left of 48 are all smaller than 48. Now, start scanning numbers from 60, in the right to left direction. As soon as you find lesser number, swap it with 48.

In this case, it is 44. Swap it with 48. The final result is:

[[File:Quicksort4.pdf|500px]]

Now, beginning with 44, scan the list from left to right, until you find a number greater than 48.

Such a number is 84. Swap it with 48. The final result is:

[[File:Quicksort5.pdf|500px]]

Now, beginning with 84, traverse the list from right to left, until you reach a number lesser than 48. We do not find such a number before reaching 48. This means that all the numbers in the list have been scanned and compared with 48. Also, we notice that all numbers less than 48 are to the left of it, and all numbers greater than 48, are to its right.

The final partitions look as follows:

[[File:Quicksort6.pdf|500px]]

Therefore, 48 has been placed in its proper position and now our task is reduced to sorting the two partitions.
This above step of creating partitions can be repeated with every partition containing 2 or more elements. As we can process only a single partition at a time, we should be able to keep track of the other partitions, for future processing.

This is done by using two '''stacks''' called LOWERBOUND and UPPERBOUND, to temporarily store these partitions. The addresses of the first and last elements of the partitions are pushed into the LOWERBOUND and UPPERBOUND stacks respectively. Now, the above reduction step is applied to the partitions only after its boundary values are ''popped'' from the stack.

We can understand this from the following example:

Take the above list A with 12 elements. The algorithm starts by pushing the boundary values of A, that is 1 and 12 into the LOWERBOUND and UPPERBOUND stacks respectively.  Therefore the stacks look as follows:

     LOWERBOUND:  1                   UPPERBOUND:  12

To perform the reduction step, the values of the stack top are popped from the stack. Therefore, both the stacks become empty.

     LOWERBOUND:  {empty}                UPPERBOUND: {empty}

Now, the reduction step causes 48 to be fixed to the 5th position and creates two partitions, one from position 1 to 4 and the other from position 6 to 12. Hence, the values 1 and 6 are pushed into the LOWERBOUND stack and 4 and 12 are pushed into the UPPERBOUND stack.

     LOWERBOUND:  1, 6                   UPPERBOUND: 4, 12

For applying the reduction step again, the values at the stack top are popped. Therefore, the values 6 and 12 are popped. Therefore the stacks look like:

     LOWERBOUND:  1                      UPPERBOUND: 4

The reduction step is now applied to the second partition, that is from the 6th to 12th element.

[[File:Quicksort7.pdf|500px]]

After the reduction step, 98 is fixed in the 11th position. So, the second partition has only one element. Therefore, we push the upper and lower boundary values of the first partition onto the stack. So, the stacks are as follows:

     LOWERBOUND:  1, 6                   UPPERBOUND:  4, 10

The processing proceeds in the following way and ends when the stacks do not contain any upper and lower bounds of the partition to be processed, and the list gets sorted.

==== The Stock Span Problem ====
[[File:Stockspan.pdf|325px|thumb|The Stockspan Problem]]
In the stock span problem, we will solve a financial problem with the help of stacks.

Suppose, for a stock, we have a series of ''n'' daily price quotes, the ''span'' of the stock's price on a particular day is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days for which the price of the stock on the current day is less than or equal to its price on that day.

===== An algorithm which has Quadratic Time Complexity =====

'''Input:''' An array ''P'' with ''n'' elements

'''Output:''' An array ''S''  of ''n'' elements such that P[i] is the largest integer k such that k &lt;= i + 1 and P[y] &lt;= P[i] for j = i - k + 1,.....,i

'''Algorithm:'''

        1. Initialize an array P which contains the daily prices of the stocks
        2. Initialize an array S which will store the span of the stock
        3. '''for''' i = 0 to i = n - 1
                3.1 Initialize k to zero
                3.2 Done with a ''false'' condition
                3.3 '''repeat'''
                      3.3.1 if ( P[i - k] &lt;= P[i)] then
                                Increment k by 1
                      3.3.2 else
                                Done with ''true'' condition
                3.4 Till (k &gt; i) or done with processing
                      Assign value of k to S[i] to get the span of the stock
        4. Return array S

Now, analyzing this algorithm for running time, we observe:

*We have initialized the array S at the beginning and returned it at the end. This is a constant time operation, hence takes ''O''(n) time

*The ''repeat'' loop is nested within the ''for'' loop. The ''for'' loop, whose counter is ''i'' is executed n times. The statements which are not in the repeat loop, but in the for loop are executed ''n'' times. Therefore these statements and the incrementing and condition testing of i take ''O''(n) time.

*In repetition of i for the outer for loop, the body of the inner ''repeat'' loop is executed maximum i + 1 times. In the worst case, element S[i] is greater than all the previous elements. So, testing for the if condition, the statement after that, as well as testing the until condition, will be performed i + 1 times during iteration i for the outer for loop. Hence, the total time taken by the inner loop is ''O''(n(n + 1)/2), which is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n^2 &lt;/math&gt;)

The running time of all these steps is calculated by adding the time taken by all these three steps. The first two terms are ''O''(&lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;) while the last term is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n^2 &lt;/math&gt;). Therefore the total running time of the algorithm is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n^2 &lt;/math&gt;).

===== An algorithm that has Linear Time Complexity =====

In order to calculate the span more efficiently, we see that the span on a particular day can be easily calculated if we know the closest day before ''i'' , such that the price of the stocks on that day was higher than the price of the stocks on the present day. If there exists such a day, we can represent it by h(i) and initialize h(i) to be -1.

Therefore the span of a particular day is given by the formula,
s = i - h(i).

To implement this logic, we use a stack as an abstract data type to store the days i, h(i), h(h(i)) and so on. When we go from day i-1 to i, we pop the days when the price of the stock was less than or equal to p(i) and then push the value of day ''i'' back into the stack.

Here, we assume that the stack is implemented by operations that take ''O''(1) that is constant time. The algorithm is as follows:

'''Input:''' An array P with ''n'' elements and an empty stack N

'''Output:''' An array ''S''  of ''n'' elements such that P[i] is the largest integer k such that k &lt;= i + 1 and P[y] &lt;= P[i] for j = i - k + 1,.....,i

'''Algorithm:'''

        1. Initialize an array P which contains the daily prices of the stocks
        2. Initialize an array S which will store the span of the stock
        3. '''for''' i = 0 to i = n - 1
                3.1 Initialize k to zero
                3.2 Done with a ''false'' condition
                3.3 '''while not''' (Stack N is empty or done with processing)
                      3.3.1 if ( P[i] &gt;= P[N.top())] then
                                Pop a value from stack N
                      3.3.2 else
                                Done with ''true'' condition
                3.4 if Stack N is empty
                         3.4.1 Initialize h to -1
                3.5 else
                         3.5.1 Initialize stack top to h
                         3.5.2 Put the value of h - i in S[i]
                         3.5.3 Push the value of i in N 
        4. Return array S

Now, analyzing this algorithm for running time, we observe:

*We have initialized the array S at the beginning and returned it at the end. This is a constant time operation, hence takes ''O''(n) time

*The ''while'' loop is nested within the ''for'' loop. The ''for'' loop, whose counter is ''i'' is executed n times. The statements which are not in the repeat loop, but in the for loop are executed ''n'' times. Therefore these statements and the incrementing and condition testing of i take ''O''(n) time.

*Now, observe the inner while loop during ''i'' repetitions of the for loop. The statement ''done with a true condition'' is done at most once, since it causes an exit from the loop. Let us say that t(i) is the number of times statement ''Pop a value from stack N'' is executed. So it becomes clear that ''while not (Stack N is empty or done with processing)'' is tested maximum t(i) + 1 times.

*Adding the running time of all the operations in the while loop, we get:


:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}t(i) +  1&lt;/math&gt; 

*An element once popped from the stack N is never pushed back into it. Therefore,


:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}t(i)&lt;/math&gt;

So, the running time of all the statements in the while loop is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;)

The running time of all the steps in the algorithm is calculated by adding the time taken by all these steps. The run time of each step is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). Hence the running time complexity of this algorithm is ''O''(&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Queues ===
A queue is a basic data structure that is used throughout programming.  You can think of it as a line in a grocery store.  The first one in the line is the first one to be served.Just like a queue.

A queue is also called a FIFO (First In First Out) to demonstrate the way it accesses data.

&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;Queue&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; Operations&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;code&gt;Queue&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; Operations'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''enqueue'''(&lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adds an item onto the end of the queue.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''front'''():item-type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the item at the front of the queue.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''dequeue'''()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes the item from the front of the queue.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-empty'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if no more items can be dequeued and there is no front item.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-full'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if no more items can be enqueued.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-size'''():Integer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the number of elements in the queue.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

All operations except &lt;code&gt;get-size()&lt;/code&gt; can be performed in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time. &lt;code&gt;get-size()&lt;/code&gt; runs in at worst &lt;math&gt;O(N).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


==== Linked List Implementation ====
The basic linked list implementation uses a singly-linked list with a tail pointer to keep track of the back of the queue.
 type Queue&lt;item_type&gt;
   data list:Singly Linked List&lt;item_type&gt;
   data tail:List Iterator&lt;item_type&gt;
 
   constructor()
     list := new Singly-Linked-List()
     tail := list.get-begin() # null
   end constructor

When you want to '''enqueue''' something, you simply add it to the back of the item pointed to by the tail pointer.  So the previous tail is considered next compared to the item being added and the tail pointer points to the new item. If the list was empty, this doesn't work, since the tail iterator doesn't refer to anything
  method enqueue(new_item:item_type)
    if is-empty()
      list.prepend(new_item)
      tail := list.get-begin()
    else
      list.insert_after(new_item, tail)
      tail.move-next()
    end if
  end method

The '''front''' item on the queue is just the one referred to by the linked list's head pointer
   method front():item_type
     return list.get-begin().get-value()
   end method

When you want to '''dequeue''' something off the list, simply point the head pointer to the previous from head item.  The old head item is the one you removed of the list. If the list is now empty, we have to fix the tail iterator.
   method dequeue()
     list.remove-first()
     if is-empty()
       tail := list.get-begin()
     end if
   end method

A check for emptiness is easy.  Just check if the list is empty.
   method is-empty():Boolean
     return list.is-empty()
   end method

A check for full is simple.  Linked lists are considered to be limitless in size.
   method is-full():Boolean
     return False
   end method

A check for the size is again passed through to the list.
   method get-size():Integer
     return list.get-size()
   end method
 end type


&lt;!-- Removed C++. Move this to appendix
Here is a C++ sample code for this:
 typedef struct Queue_Element_t {
   int data;
   struct Queue_Element_t *next, *previous;
 }Queue_Element_T;
 
 class Queue
 {
  public:
    Queue()
      {
       _head = NULL;
       _tail = NULL;
       _size = 0;
      }
    void add(int data);
    int remove(void);
    bool isEmpty(void)
      {
       return (_head == NULL);
      }
    bool isFull(void)
      {
       return false;
      }
    unsigned int getSize()
      {
       return _size;
      }
 
  private:
    Queue_Element_T *_head, *_tail;
    unsigned int _size;
 };
 
 void Queue::add(int data)
 {
  Queue_Element_T *new_element;
 
  if(!_head){
    _head = _tail = new Queue_Element_T;
    _head-&gt;data     = data;
    _head-&gt;next     = NULL;
    _head-&gt;previous = NULL;
  }
  else{
    new_element = new Queue_Element_T;
    new_element-&gt;data     = data;
    new_element-&gt;next     = NULL; 
    new_element-&gt;previous = _tail;
    _tail-&gt;next           = new_element;
    _tail = new_element;
  }
 
  _size++;
 }
 
 int Queue::remove(void)
 {
   int return_value = _head-&gt;data;
   Queue_Element_T *old_head;
 
   old_head = _head;
   _head = _head-&gt;next;
 
   delete old_head;
 
   _size--;
 
   return return_value;
 }--&gt;

===== Performance Analysis =====

In a linked list, accessing the first element is an &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; operation because the list contains a pointer directly to it. Therefore, enqueue, front, and dequeue are a quick &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; operations.

The checks for empty/fullness as done here are also &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

The performance of &lt;code&gt;getSize()&lt;/code&gt; depends on the performance of the corresponding operation in the linked list implementation. It could be either &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, depending on what time/space tradeoff is made. Most of the time, users of a Queue do not use the &lt;code&gt;getSize()&lt;/code&gt; operation, and so a bit of space can be saved by not optimizing it.

Some definitions of a heap follow:

A heap is an array , where there are parent child relationships, and the index of a child is 2 * parent index, or 2* parent index + 1 , and a child has an &lt;i&gt;order&lt;i&gt; after the parent, in some concrete ordering scheme injected by a client program of a heap. There is importance in maintaining the ordering n variant after the heap is changed. Some ( Sedgewick and Wayne), have coined the term &quot;swim&quot; and &quot;sink&quot;, where maintenance of the invariant involves a invariant breaking item swimming up above children of lower ordering, and then sinking below any children of higher ordering, as there may be two children , so one can swim above a lower ordered child, and still have another child with higher ordering.

A heap is an efficient semi-ordered data structure for storing a collection of orderable data. A min-heap supports two operations:
   INSERT(heap, element)
   element REMOVE_MIN(heap)

(we discuss min-heaps, but there's no real difference
between min and max heaps, except how the comparison
is interpreted.)

This chapter will refer exclusively to binary heaps, although different types of heaps exist. The term binary heap and heap are interchangeable in most cases. A heap can be thought of as a tree with parent and child. The main difference between a heap and a binary tree is the heap property. In order for a data structure to be considered a heap, it must satisfy the following condition (heap property): 

:If ''A'' and ''B'' are elements in the heap and ''B'' is a child of ''A'', then key(''A'') &amp;le; key(''B'').

(This property applies for a min-heap. A max heap would have the comparison reversed). 
What this tells us is that the minimum key will always remain at the top and greater values will be below it. Due to this fact, heaps are used to implement priority queues which allows quick access to the item with the most priority. Here's an example of a min-heap: 
[[Image:binary-heap.png|thumb|300px|right]]
A heap is implemented using an array that is indexed from 1 to N,
where N is the number of elements in the heap.

At any time, the heap must satisfy the heap property
   array[n] &lt;= array[2*n]   // parent element &lt;= left child
and
   array[n] &lt;= array[2*n+1] // parent element &lt;= right child
whenever the indices are in the arrays bounds.

==Compute the extreme value==
We will prove that &lt;code&gt;array[1]&lt;/code&gt; is the minimum element in the heap.
We prove it by seeing a contradiction if some other element is less than the first element.
Suppose &lt;code&gt;array[i]&lt;/code&gt; is the first instance of the minimum,
with &lt;code&gt;array[j] &gt; array[i]&lt;/code&gt; for all &lt;code&gt;j &lt; i&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;i &gt;= 2&lt;/code&gt;.
But by the heap invariant array, &lt;code&gt;array[floor(i/2)] &lt;= array[i]&lt;/code&gt;:
this is a contradiction.

Therefore, it is easy to compute &lt;code&gt;MIN(heap)&lt;/code&gt;:
  
   MIN(heap)
      return heap.array[1];

==Removing the Extreme Value==
To remove the minimum element, we must adjust the heap
to fill &lt;code&gt;heap.array[1]&lt;/code&gt;.  This process is called ''percolation''.
Basically, we move the hole from node i to either node &lt;code&gt;2i&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;2i+1&lt;/code&gt;.
If we pick the minimum of these two, the heap invariant will be maintained;
suppose &lt;code&gt;array[2i] &lt; array[2i+1]&lt;/code&gt;.  Then &lt;code&gt;array[2i]&lt;/code&gt; will be moved to &lt;code&gt;array[i]&lt;/code&gt;,
leaving a hole at &lt;code&gt;2i&lt;/code&gt;, but after the move &lt;code&gt;array[i] &lt; array[2i+1]&lt;/code&gt;, so the heap invariant is maintained.
In some cases, &lt;code&gt;2i+1&lt;/code&gt; will exceed the array bounds, and we are forced to percolate &lt;code&gt;2i&lt;/code&gt;.  In other cases,
&lt;code&gt;2i&lt;/code&gt; is also outside the bounds: in that case, we are done.


Therefore, here is the remove algorithm:


 #define LEFT(i) (2*i)

 #define RIGHT(i) (2*i + 1)  

 REMOVE_MIN(heap)
 {  
     savemin=arr[1];
     arr[1]=arr[--heapsize];
     i=1;
     while(i&lt;heapsize){
         minidx=i;
         if(LEFT(i)&lt;heapsize &amp;&amp; arr[LEFT(i)] &lt; arr[minidx])
             minidx=LEFT(i);
         if(RIGHT(i)&lt;heapsize &amp;&amp; arr[RIGHT(i)] &lt; arr[minidx]) 
             minidx=RIGHT(i);
         if(minidx!=i){
             swap(arr[i],arr[minidx]);
             i=minidx;            
         }
         else 
             break;
     }
 }

Why does this work?
    If there is only 1 element ,heapsize becomes 0, nothing in the array is valid.
    If there are 2 elements , one min and other max, you replace min with max.
    If there are 3 or more elements say n, you replace 0th element with n-1th element. 
    The heap property is destroyed. Choose the 2 children of root and check which is the minimum.
    Choose the minimum between them, swap it. Now subtree with swapped child is loose heap property.
    If no violations break.

==Inserting a value into the heap==
A similar strategy exists for INSERT:  just append the element to the array,
then fixup the heap-invariants by swapping.
For example if we just appended element N,
then the only invariant violation possible involves that element,
in particular if &lt;math&gt;array[floor(N/2)] &gt; array[N]&lt;/math&gt;,
then those two elements must be swapped and
now the only invariant violation possible is between
  array[floor(N/4)]  and  array[floor(N/2)]
we continue iterating until N=1 or until the invariant is satisfied.
 
 INSERT(heap, element)
    append(heap.array, element)
    i = heap.array.length
    while (i &gt; 1)
      {
        if (heap.array[i/2] &lt;= heap.array[i])
          break;
        swap(heap.array[i/2], heap.array[i]);
        i /= 2;
      }

==TODO==
  Merge-heap: it would take two max/min heap and merge them and return a single heap. O(n) time.
  Make-heap: it would also be nice to describe the O(n) make-heap operation
  Heap sort: the structure can actually be used to efficiently sort arrays
  

Make-heap would make use a function heapify

 //Element is a data structure//
    Make-heap(Element Arr[],int size) 
    {
        for(j=size/2;j&gt;0;j--)
            {
                Heapify(Arr,size,j);
            }
    }

    Heapify(Element Arr[],int size,int t)
    {
        L=2*t;
        R=2*t+1;
        if(L&lt;size )
        {
            mix=minindex(Arr,L,t);
            if(R&lt;=size)
                mix=minindex(Arr,R,mix);
        }
        else
            mix=t;
        if(mix!=t)
        {
            swap(mix,t);
            Heapify(Arr,size,mix);
        }
    }

minindex returns index of the smaller element

==Applications of Priority Heaps==
In 2009, a smaller Sort Benchmark was won by OzSort, which has a paper describing lucidly how to use a priority heap
as the sorting machine to produce merged parts of large (internally) sorted sections . If a sorted section took M memory
and the sorting problem was k x M big, then take  sequential sections of each of the k sections of size M/k , at a time, so they
fit in M memory ( k * M/k = M ), and feed the first element of each of k sections to make a k sized priority queue, and as the top element
is removed and written to an output buffer, take the next element from the corresponding section. This means elements may need
to be associated with a label for the section they come from. When a M/k-sized section is exhausted, load in the next
M/k sized minisection from the original sorted section stored on disc. Continue until all minisections in each of the
k sections on disc have been exhausted. 

(As an example of pipelining to fill up disc operational delays, there are twin output buffers, so that once an output buffer is full
one gets written the disc while the other is being filled.)

This paper showed that a priority heap is more straightforward than
a binary tree, because elements are constantly being deleted, as well as added, as a queuing mechanism for a k way merge, and has
practical application for sorting large sets of data that exceed internal memory storage.

Sets are helpful tools in a software application where, just as in mathematics, similar abstract objects are collected into groups. A mathematical set has a fairly simple interface and can be implemented in a surprising number of ways.

&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;Set&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; ADT&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;code&gt;Set&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ADT'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''contains'''(&lt;var&gt;test-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type):Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if &lt;var&gt;test-item&lt;/var&gt; is contained in the Set.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''insert'''(&lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adds &lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt; into the set.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''remove'''(&lt;var&gt;item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes &lt;var&gt;item&lt;/var&gt; from the set. If &lt;var&gt;item&lt;/var&gt; wasn't in the set, this method does nothing.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''remove'''(&lt;var&gt;item-iter&lt;/var&gt;:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes the item referred to by &lt;var&gt;item-iter&lt;/var&gt; from the set.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-begin'''():List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Allows iteration over the elements in the Set.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-end'''():List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Also allows iteration over the elements in the Set.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''union'''(&lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt;:Set&lt;item-type&gt;):Set&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns a set containing all elements in either this or the &lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt; set. Has a default implementation.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''intersect'''(&lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt;:Set&lt;item-type&gt;):Set&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns a set containing all elements in both this and the &lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt; set. Has a default implementation.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''subtract'''(&lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt;:Set&lt;item-type&gt;):Set&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns a set containing all elements in this but not the &lt;var&gt;other&lt;/var&gt; set. Has a default implementation.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-empty'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if no more items can be popped and there is no top item.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-size'''():Integer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the number of elements in the set.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

All operations can be performed in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;/div&gt;

==List implementation==

There are several different ways to implement sets. The simplest, but in most cases least efficient, method is to simply create a linear list (an array, linked list or similar structure) containing each of the elements in the set. For the most basic operation, testing membership, a possible implementation could look like
 '''function''' ''contains''('''List'''&lt;'''T'''&gt; list, '''T''' member)
     '''for''' item '''in''' list
         '''if''' item == member
             '''return''' True
     '''return''' False

To add new members to this set, simply add the element to beginning or end of the list. (If a check is done to ensure no duplicate elements, some other operations may be simpler.) Other operations can be similarly implemented in terms of simple list operations. Unfortunately, the membership test has a worst-case running time of &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; if the item is not in the list, and even an average-case time of the same, assuming the item is equally likely to be anywhere in the list. If the set is small, or if frequently accessed items can be placed near the front of the list, this may be an efficient solution, but other options can have a faster running time.

Assuming elements can be ordered and insertions and deletions are rare, a list guaranteed to be in sorted order with no duplicate elements can be much more efficient. Using an ordered list, the membership test can be efficient to the order of &lt;math&gt;O(log n)&lt;/math&gt;. Additionally, union, intersection and subtraction can be implemented in linear time, whereas they would take quadratic time with unordered lists.

==Bit array implementation==

For certain data, it may be more practical to maintain a bit array describing the contents of the set. In this representation, there is a 1 or 0 corresponding to each element of the problem domain, specifying whether the object is an element of the set. For a simple case, assume that only integers from 0 to n can be members of the set, where n is known beforehand. This can be represented by a bit array of length n+1. The ''contains'' operation is simple:
 '''function''' ''contains''('''BitArray''' array, '''Int''' member)
     '''if''' member &gt;= ''length''(array)
        '''return''' False
     '''else if''' array[member] == 1
        '''return''' True
     '''else'''
        '''return''' False

To add or remove an element from this sort of set, simply modify the bit array to reflect whether that index should be 1 or 0. The membership runs in exactly &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; (constant) time, but it has a severely restricted domain. It is possible to shift the domain, going from m to n with step k, rather than 0 to n with step 1 as is specified above, but there is not much flexibility possible here. Nevertheless, for the right domain, this is often the most efficient solution.

Bit arrays are efficient structures for storing sets of Boolean variables. One example is a set of command line options that enable various run-time behavior for the application. C and similar languages offer bit-wise operators that let the programmer access a bit field in a single machine instruction, where array access would normally need two or three instructions including a memory read operation. A full-featured bit set implementation includes operators for computing a set union, set intersection, set difference, and element values&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Harbison and Guy Steele. C: a reference manual. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Associative array implementation==
Associative arrays--that is, hash tables and binary search trees, represent a heavyweight but general representation of sets. Binary trees generally have &lt;math&gt;O(log n)&lt;/math&gt; time implementations for lookup and mutation for a particular key, and hash tables have a &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; implementation (though there is a higher constant factor). Additionally, they are capable of storing nearly any key type. The membership test is trivial: simply test if the potential set member exists as a key in the associative array. To add an element, just add the set member as a key in the associative array, with a dummy value. In optimized implementations, instead of reusing an existing associative array implementation, it is possible to write a specialized hash table or binary tree which does not store values corresponding to keys. Values are not meaningful here, and they take up a constant factor of additional memory space.

It is important to fully understand the problem you need to solve before choosing a data structure because each structure is optimized for a particular job. Hash tables, for example, favor fast lookup times over memory usage while arrays are compact and inflexible. Other structures, such as stacks, are optimized to enforce rigid rules on how data is added, removed and accessed throughout the program execution. A good understanding of data structures is fundamental because it gives us the tools for thinking about a program's behavior in a structured way.

  [TODO:]
  Use asymptotic behaviour to decide, most importantly seeing how the
  structure will be ''used'': an infrequent operation does not need to be
  fast if it means everything else will be much faster


  [TODO:]
  Can use a table like this one to compare the asymptotic behaviour of every
  structure for every operation on it.

  Could also contain table with space complexity information (there is a significative cost

The structure of the Italian verb system is very coherent and intelligible.  If one understands that the structure can be perceived as a chart of interrelated concepts, a great deal of the mystery about Italian verb structure disappears.
In order to gain an understanding of the structure of the system, one should determine answers to the following questions:
What is the congugation category of the verb (1st, 2nd or 3rd)?
What is the behavior of the verb (regular or irregular)?
What is the voice category of the verb (Active or Passive)?
What is the mood category (Indicative, Subjunctive, Conditional, or Imperative)?

== Asymptotic Notation ==

=== Introduction ===
There is no single data structure that offers optimal performance in every case.  In order to choose the best structure for a particular task, we need to be able to judge how long a particular solution will take to run.  Or, more accurately, you need to be able to judge how long two solutions will take to run, and choose the better of the two.  We don't need to know how many minutes and seconds they will take, but we do need some way to compare algorithms against one another.

''Asymptotic complexity'' is a way of expressing the ''main component'' of the cost of an algorithm, using idealized (not comparable) units of computational work.  Consider, for example, the algorithm for sorting a deck of cards, which proceeds by repeatedly searching through the deck for the lowest card.  The asymptotic complexity of this algorithm is the ''square'' of the number of cards in the deck.  This quadratic behavior is the main term in the complexity formula, it says, e.g., if you double the size of the deck, then the work is roughly quadrupled.  

The exact formula for the cost is more complex, and it contains more details than we need to understand the essential complexity of the algorithm.  With our deck of cards, in the worst case, the deck would start out reverse-sorted, so our scans would have to go all the way to the end.  The first scan would involve scanning 52 cards, the next would take 51, etc.  So the cost formula is 52 + 51 + ..... + 2.  Generally, letting N be the number of cards, the formula is 2 + ... + N, which equals &lt;math&gt;((N) \times (N + 1) / 2) - 1 = ((N^2 + N) / 2) - 1 = (1/2)N^2 + (1/2)N - 1&lt;/math&gt;.  But the &lt;math&gt;N^2&lt;/math&gt; term dominates the expression, and this is what is key for comparing algorithm costs.  (This is in fact an ''expensive'' algorithm; the best sorting algorithms run in sub-quadratic time.)

Asymptotically speaking, in the limit as N tends towards infinity, 2 + 3 + .,,,.. + N gets closer and closer to the pure quadratic function (1/2)N^2.  And what difference does the constant factor of 1/2 make, at this level of abstraction?  So the behavior is said to be &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now let us consider how we would go about ''comparing'' the complexity of two algorithms.   Let f(n) be the cost, in the worst case, of one algorithm, expressed as a function of the input size n, and g(n) be the cost function for the other algorithm.  E.g., for sorting algorithms, f(10) and g(10) would be the maximum number of steps that the algorithms would take on a list of 10 items.  If, for all values of n&amp;nbsp;&gt;=&amp;nbsp;0, f(n) is less than or equal to g(n), then the algorithm with complexity function f is strictly faster.  But, generally speaking, our concern for computational cost is for the cases with large inputs; so the comparison of f(n) and g(n) for small values of n is less significant than the &quot;long term&quot; comparison of f(n) and g(n), for n larger than some threshold.

Note that we have been speaking about ''bounds'' on the performance of algorithms, rather than giving exact speeds.  The actual number of steps required to sort our deck of cards (with our naive quadratic algorithm) will depend upon the order in which the cards begin.  The actual time to perform each of our steps will depend upon our processor speed, the condition of our processor cache, etc., etc.  It's all very complicated in the concrete details, and moreover not relevant to the essence of the algorithm.
----

=== The O Notation ===
==== Definition ====
The O (pronounced ''big-oh'') is the formal method of expressing the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.  It's a measure of the longest amount of time it could possibly take for the algorithm to complete.  

More formally, for non-negative functions, ''f(n)'' and ''g(n)'', if there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and a constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for all integers &lt;math&gt;n&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''cg(n)'', then ''f(n)'' is Big O of ''g(n)''.  This is denoted as &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''O(g(n))''&quot;.  If graphed, ''g(n)'' serves as an upper bound to the curve you are analyzing, ''f(n)''.

Note that if ''f'' can take on finite values only (as it should happen normally) then this definition implies that there exists some constant ''C'' (potentially larger than ''c'') such that for all values of ''n'', ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''Cg(n)''. An appropriate value for ''C'' is the maximum of ''c'' and &lt;math&gt; \max_{1\le n\le n_0} f(n)/g(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Theory Examples ====
So, let's take an example of Big-O.  Say that f(n) = 2n + 8, and g(n) = &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Can we find a constant &lt;math&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, so that 2n + 8 &lt;= &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;?  The number 4 works here, giving us 16 &lt;= 16.  For any number n greater than 4, this will still work.  Since we're trying to generalize this for large values of n, and small values (1, 2, 3) aren't that important, we can say that f(n) is generally faster than g(n); that is, f(n) is bound by g(n), and will always be less than it.

It could then be said that f(n) runs in O(&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;) time: &quot;f-of-n runs in Big-O of n-squared time&quot;.

To find the upper bound - the Big-O time - assuming we know that f(n) is equal to (exactly) 2n + 8, we can take a few shortcuts.  For example, we can remove all constants from the runtime; eventually, at some value of c, they become irrelevant.  This makes f(n) = 2n.  Also, for convenience of comparison, we remove constant multipliers; in this case, the 2.  This makes f(n) = n.  It could also be said that f(n) runs in O(n) time; that lets us put a tighter (closer) upper bound onto the estimate.

====Practical Examples====
O(n): printing a list of n items to the screen, looking at each item once.

O(ln n): also &quot;log n&quot;, taking a list of items, cutting it in half repeatedly until there's only one item left.

O(&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;): taking a list of n items, and comparing every item to every other item.
----

=== ''Big-Omega Notation'' ===
For non-negative functions, ''f(n)'' and ''g(n)'', if there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt; and a constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for all integers &lt;math&gt;n&gt;n_{0}&lt;/math&gt;, ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''cg(n)'', then ''f(n)'' is omega of ''g(n)''.  This is denoted as &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Omega;(g(n))''&quot;.

This is almost the same definition as Big Oh, except that &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''cg(n)''&quot;, this makes ''g(n)'' a lower bound function, instead of an upper bound function.  It describes the '''best that can happen''' for a given data size.
----
==== Theta Notation ====
For non-negative functions, ''f(n)'' and ''g(n)'', ''f(n)'' is theta of ''g(n)'' if and only if ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''O(g(n))'' and ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Omega;(g(n))''.  This is denoted as &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Theta;(g(n))''&quot;.

This is basically saying that the function, ''f(n)'' is bounded both from the top and bottom by the same function, ''g(n)''.
----
The theta notation is denoted by Q.

==== Little-O Notation ====
For non-negative functions, ''f(n)'' and ''g(n)'', ''f(n)'' is little o of ''g(n)'' if and only if ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''O(g(n))'', but ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Theta;(g(n))''.  This is denoted as &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''o(g(n))''&quot;.

This represents a loose bounding version of Big O.  ''g(n)'' bounds from the top, but it does not bound the bottom.
----
====Little Omega Notation====
For non-negative functions, ''f(n)'' and ''g(n)'', ''f(n)'' is little omega of ''g(n)'' if and only if ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Omega;(g(n))'', but ''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;Theta;(g(n))''.  This is denoted as &quot;''f(n)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;omega;(g(n))''&quot;.

Much like Little Oh, this is the equivalent for Big Omega.  ''g(n)'' is a loose lower boundary of the function ''f(n)'';  it bounds from the bottom, but not from the top.
----
=== How asymptotic notation relates to analyzing complexity ===

Temporal comparison is not the only issue in algorithms. There are space issues as well. Generally, a trade off between time and space is noticed in algorithms. Asymptotic notation empowers you to make that trade off. If you think of the amount of time and space your algorithm uses as a function of your data over time or space (time and space are usually analyzed separately), you can analyze how the time and space is handled when you introduce more data to your program.

This is important in data structures because you want a structure that behaves efficiently as you increase the amount of data it handles.  Keep in mind though that algorithms that are efficient with large amounts of data are not always simple and efficient for small amounts of data.  So if you know you are working with only a small amount of data and you have concerns for speed and code space, a trade off can be made for a function that does not behave well for large amounts of data.

=== A few examples of asymptotic notation ===

Generally, we use asymptotic notation as a convenient way to examine what can happen in a function in the worst case or in the best case.  For example, if you want to write a function that searches through an array of numbers and returns the smallest one:

 function '''find-min'''(array ''a''[1..''n''])
   let ''j'' := &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   for ''i'' := 1 to ''n'':
     ''j'' := min(''j'', ''a''[''i''])
   repeat
   return ''j''
 end

Regardless of how big or small the array is, every time we run '''find-min''', we have to initialize the ''i'' and ''j'' integer variables and return ''j'' at the end.  Therefore, we can just think of those parts of the function as constant and ignore them.

So, how can we use asymptotic notation to discuss the '''find-min''' function?  If we search through an array with 87 elements, then the ''for'' loop iterates 87 times, even if the very first element we hit turns out to be the minimum.   Likewise, for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements, the for loop iterates &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times.  Therefore we say the function runs in time &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

What about this function:

 function '''find-min-plus-max'''(array ''a''[1..''n''])
   ''// First, find the smallest element in the array''
   let ''j'' := &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;;
   for ''i'' := 1 to ''n'':
     ''j'' := min(''j'', ''a''[''i''])
   repeat
   let ''minim'' := ''j''
   
   ''// Now, find the biggest element, add it to the smallest and''
   j := &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;;
   for ''i'' := 1 to ''n'':
     ''j'' := max(''j'', ''a''[''i''])
   repeat
   let ''maxim'' := ''j''
   
   ''// return the sum of the two''
   return ''minim'' + ''maxim'';
 end

What's the running time for '''find-min-plus-max'''? There are two ''for'' loops, that each iterate &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times, so the running time is clearly &lt;math&gt;O(2n)&lt;/math&gt;. Because 2 is a constant, we throw it away and write the running time as &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;. Why can you do this? If you recall the definition of Big-O notation, the function whose bound you're testing can be multiplied by some constant. If ''f(x)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''2x'', we can see that if ''g(x)''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'', then the Big-O condition holds. Thus &lt;math&gt;O(2n) = O(n)&lt;/math&gt;. This rule is general for the various asymptotic notations.

== List Structures and Iterators ==
We have seen now two different data structures that allow us to store an ordered sequence of elements. However, they have two very different interfaces. The array allows us to use &lt;code&gt;get-element()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set-element()&lt;/code&gt; functions to access and change elements. The node chain requires us to use &lt;code&gt;get-next()&lt;/code&gt; until we find the desired node, and then we can use &lt;code&gt;get-value()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set-value()&lt;/code&gt; to access and modify its value. Now, what if you've written some code, and you realize that you should have been using the other sequence data structure? You have to go through all of the code you've already written and change one set of accessor functions into another. What a pain! Fortunately, there is a way to localize this change into only one place: by using the '''List''' Abstract Data Type (ADT).

&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;List&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; ADT&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;code&gt;List&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ADT'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-begin'''():List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the ''list iterator'' (we'll define this soon) that represents the first element of the list. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-end'''():List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the list iterator that represents one element past the last element in the list. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''prepend'''(&lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adds a new element at the beginning of a list. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''insert-after'''(&lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;, &lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Adds a new element immediately after &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''remove-first'''()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes the element at the beginning of a list. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''remove-after'''(&lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Removes the element immediately after &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''is-empty'''():Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if there are no elements in the list. Has a default implementation. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-size'''():Integer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the number of elements in the list. Has a default implementation. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-nth'''(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;:Integer):item-type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the nth element in the list, counting from 0. Has a default implementation. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''set-nth'''(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;:Integer, &lt;var&gt;new-value&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Assigns a new value to the nth element in the list, counting from 0. Has a default implementation. Runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The '''iterator''' is another abstraction that encapsulates both access to a single element and incremental movement around the list. Its interface is very similar to the node interface presented in the introduction, but since it is an abstract type, different lists can implement it differently.
&lt;div class=&quot;interface&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; width:80%&quot; title=&quot;List Iterator&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; ADT&quot;&gt;
'''&lt;code&gt;List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;&lt;/code&gt; ADT'''
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''get-value'''():item-type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Returns the value of the list element that this iterator refers to.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''set-value'''(&lt;var&gt;new-value&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Assigns a new value to the list element that this iterator refers to.&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''move-next'''()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Makes this iterator refer to the next element in the list.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt style=&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''equal'''(&lt;var&gt;other-iter&lt;/var&gt;:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;):Boolean&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;True if the other iterator refers to the same list element as this iterator.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
All operations run in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.
&lt;/div&gt;

There are several other aspects of the List ADT's definition that need more explanation. First, notice that the &lt;code&gt;get-end()&lt;/code&gt; operation returns an iterator that is &quot;one past the end&quot; of the list. This makes its implementation a little trickier, but allows you to write loops like:
 var iter:List Iterator := list.get-begin()
 while(not iter.equal(list.get-end()))
  # Do stuff with the iterator
  iter.move-next()
 end while

Second, each operation gives a worst-case running time. Any implementation of the List ADT is guaranteed to be able to run these operation at least that fast. Most implementations will run most of the operations faster. For example, the node chain implementation of List can run &lt;code&gt;insert-after()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Third, some of the operations say that they have a default implementation. This means that these operations can be implemented in terms of other, more primitive operations. They're included in the ADT so that certain implementations can implement them faster. For example, the default implementation of &lt;code&gt;get-nth()&lt;/code&gt; runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; because it has to traverse all of the elements before the nth. Yet the array implementation of List can implement it in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; using its &lt;code&gt;get-element()&lt;/code&gt; operation. The other default implementations are:
 abstract type List&lt;item-type&gt;
  method is-empty()
   return get-begin().equal(get-end())
  end method
 
  method get-size():Integer
   var size:Integer := 0
   var iter:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt; := get-begin()
   while(not iter.equal(get-end()))
    size := size+1
    iter.move-next()
   end while
   return size
  end method
 
  helper method find-nth(n:Integer):List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
   if n &gt;= get-size()
    error &quot;The index is past the end of the list&quot;
   end if
   var iter:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt; := get-begin()
   while(n &gt; 0)
    iter.move-next()
    n := n-1
   end while
   return iter
  end method
 
  method get-nth(n:Integer):item-type
   return find-nth(n).get-value()
  end method
 
  method set-nth(n:Integer, new-value:item-type)
   find-nth(n).set-value(new-value)
  end method
 end type

=== Syntactic Sugar ===
Occasionally throughout this book we'll introduce an abbreviation that will allow us to write, and you to read, less pseudocode. For now, we'll introduce an easier way to compare iterators and a specialized loop for traversing sequences.

Instead of using the &lt;code&gt;equal()&lt;/code&gt; method to compare iterators, we'll overload the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; operator. To be precise, the following two expressions are equivalent:
 &lt;var&gt;iter1&lt;/var&gt;.equal(&lt;var&gt;iter2&lt;/var&gt;)
 &lt;var&gt;iter1&lt;/var&gt; == &lt;var&gt;iter2&lt;/var&gt;

Second, we'll use the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; keyword to express list traversal. The following two blocks are equivalent:
 var &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;:List Iterator&lt;&lt;var&gt;item-type&lt;/var&gt;&gt; := &lt;var&gt;list&lt;/var&gt;.get-begin()
 while(not &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; == &lt;var&gt;list&lt;/var&gt;.get-end())
  &lt;var&gt;operations on iter&lt;/var&gt;
  &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;.move-next()
 end while

 for &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; in &lt;var&gt;list&lt;/var&gt;
  &lt;var&gt;operations on iter&lt;/var&gt;
 end for

=== Implementations ===

In order to actually use the List ADT, we need to write a ''concrete'' data type that implements its interface. There are two standard data types that naturally implement List: the node chain described in the Introduction, normally called a Singly Linked List; and an extension of the array type called a Vector, which automatically resizes itself to accommodate inserted nodes.

==== Singly Linked List ====
 type Singly Linked List&lt;item-type&gt; implements List&lt;item-type&gt;
&lt;var&gt;head&lt;/var&gt; refers to the first node in the list. When it's null, the list is empty.
   data head:Node&lt;item-type&gt;

Initially, the list is empty.
   constructor()
     head := null
   end constructor
 
   method get-begin():Sll Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
     return new Sll-Iterator(head)
   end method
 
The &quot;one past the end&quot; iterator is just a null node. To see why, think about what you get when you have an iterator for the last element in the list and you call &lt;code&gt;move-next()&lt;/code&gt;.
   method get-end():Sll Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
     return new Sll-Iterator(null)
   end method
 
   method prepend(new-item:item-type)
     head = make-node(new-item, head)
   end method
 
   method insert-after(iter:Sll Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;, new-item:item-type)
     var new-node:Node&lt;item-type&gt; := make-node(new-item, iter.node().get-next())
     iter.node.set-next(new-node)
   end method
 
   method remove-first()
     head = head.get-next()
   end method
 
This takes the node the iterator holds and makes it point to the node two nodes later.
   method remove-after(iter:Sll Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;)
     iter.node.set-next(iter.node.get-next().get-next())
   end method
 end type
If we want to make &lt;code&gt;get-size()&lt;/code&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; operation, we can add an Integer data member that keeps track of the list's size at all times. Otherwise, the default &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; implementation works fine.

An iterator for a singly linked list simply consists of a reference to a node. 
 type Sll Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
   data node:Node&lt;item-type&gt;
 
   constructor(_node:Node&lt;item-type&gt;)
     node := _node
   end constructor

Most of the operations just pass through to the node.
   method get-value():item-type
     return node.get-value()
   end method
 
   method set-value(new-value:item-type)
     node.set-value(new-value)
   end method
 
   method move-next()
     node := node.get-next()
   end method

For equality testing, we assume that the underlying system knows how to compare nodes for equality. In nearly all languages, this would be a pointer comparison.
   method equal(other-iter:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;):Boolean
     return node == other-iter.node
   end method
 end type

==== Vector ====
Let's write the Vector's iterator first. It will make the Vector's implementation clearer.
 type Vector Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
   data array:Array&lt;item-type&gt;
   data index:Integer
 
   constructor(my_array:Array&lt;item-type&gt;, my_index:Integer)
     array := my_array
     index := my_index
   end constructor
 
   method get-value():item-type
     return array.get-element(index)
   end method
 
   method set-value(new-value:item-type)
     array.set-element(index, new-value)
   end method
 
   method move-next()
     index := index+1
   end method
 
   method equal(other-iter:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;):Boolean
     return array==other-iter.array and index==other-iter.index
   end method
 end type

We implement the Vector in terms of the primitive Array data type. It is inefficient to always keep the array exactly the right size (think of how much resizing you'd have to do), so we store both a &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;, the number of logical elements in the Vector, and a &lt;code&gt;capacity&lt;/code&gt;, the number of spaces in the array. The array's valid indices will ''always'' range from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;capacity-1&lt;/code&gt;.
 type Vector&lt;item-type&gt;
   data array:Array&lt;item-type&gt;
   data size:Integer
   data capacity:Integer

We initialize the vector with a capacity of 10. Choosing 10 was fairly arbitrary. If we'd wanted to make it appear less arbitrary, we would have chosen a power of 2, and innocent readers like you would assume that there was some deep, binary-related reason for the choice.
   constructor()
     array := create-array(0, 9)
     size := 0
     capacity := 10
   end constructor
 
   method get-begin():Vector-Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
     return new Vector-Iterator(array, 0)
   end method

The end iterator has an index of &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;. That's one more than the highest valid index.
   method get-end():List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;
     return new Vector-Iterator(array, size)
   end method

We'll use this method to help us implement the insertion routines. After it is called, the &lt;code&gt;capacity&lt;/code&gt; of the array is guaranteed to be at least &lt;code&gt;new-capacity&lt;/code&gt;. A naive implementation would simply allocate a new array with exactly &lt;code&gt;new-capacity&lt;/code&gt; elements and copy the old array over. To see why this is inefficient, think what would happen if we started appending elements in a loop. Once we exceeded the original capacity, each new element would require us to copy the entire array. That's why this implementation at least doubles the size of the underlying array any time it needs to grow.
   helper method ensure-capacity(new-capacity:Integer)
If the current capacity is already big enough, return quickly.
     if capacity &gt;= new-capacity
       return
     end if
Now, find the new capacity we'll need,
     var allocated-capacity:Integer := max(capacity*2, new-capacity)
     var new-array:Array&lt;item-type&gt; := create-array(0, allocated-capacity - 1)
copy over the old array,
     for i in 0..size-1
       new-array.set-element(i, array.get-element(i))
     end for
and update the Vector's state.
     array := new-array
     capacity := allocated-capacity
   end method

This method uses a normally-illegal iterator, which refers to the item one before the start of the Vector, to trick &lt;code&gt;insert-after()&lt;/code&gt; into doing the right thing. By doing this, we avoid duplicating code.
   method prepend(new-item:item-type)
     insert-after(new Vector-Iterator(array, -1), new-item)
   end method

&lt;code&gt;insert-after()&lt;/code&gt; needs to copy all of the elements between &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; and the end of the Vector. This means that in general, it runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time. However, in the special case where &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; refers to the last element in the vector, we don't need to copy any elements to make room for the new one. An append operation can run in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time, plus the time needed for the &lt;code&gt;ensure-capacity()&lt;/code&gt; call. &lt;code&gt;ensure-capacity()&lt;/code&gt; will sometimes need to copy the whole array, which takes &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time. But much more often, it doesn't need to do anything at all.

&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em; margin:0 2em&quot; title=&quot;List&amp;lt;item-type&amp;gt; ADT&quot;&gt;
'''Amortized Analysis'''&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, if you think of a series of append operations starting immediately after &lt;code&gt;ensure-capacity()&lt;/code&gt; increases the Vector's capacity (call the capacity here &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;), and ending immediately after the next increase in capacity, you can see that there will be exactly &lt;math&gt;\frac{C}{2}=O(C)&lt;/math&gt; appends. At the later increase in capacity, it will need to copy &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; elements over to the new array. So this entire sequence of &lt;math&gt;\frac{C}{2}&lt;/math&gt; function calls took &lt;math&gt;\frac{3C}{2}=O(C)&lt;/math&gt; operations. We call this situation, where there are &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; operations for &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; function calls &quot;''amortized'' &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time&quot;.
&lt;/div&gt;
   method insert-after(iter:Vector Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;, new-item:item-type)
     ensure-capacity(size+1)
This loop copies all of the elements in the vector into the spot one index up. We loop backwards in order to make room for each successive element just before we copy it.
     for i in size-1 .. iter.index+1 step -1
       array.set-element(i+1, array.get-element(i))
     end for
Now that there is an empty space in the middle of the array, we can put the new element there.
     array.set-element(iter.index+1, new-item)
And update the Vector's size.
     size := size+1
   end method
 
Again, cheats a little bit to avoid duplicate code.
   method remove-first()
    remove-after(new Vector-Iterator(array, -1))
   end method
 
Like &lt;code&gt;insert-after()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;remove-after&lt;/code&gt; needs to copy all of the elements between &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; and the end of the Vector. So in general, it runs in &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt; time. But in the special case where &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt; refers to the last element in the vector, we can simply decrement the Vector's size, without copying any elements. A remove-last operation runs in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time.
   method remove-after(iter:List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;)
     for i in iter.index+1 .. size-2
       array.set-element(i, array.get-element(i+1))
     end for
     size := size-1
   end method
 
This method has a default implementation, but we're already storing the size, so we can implement it in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; time, rather than the default's &lt;math&gt;O(N).&lt;/math&gt;
   method get-size():Integer
     return size
   end method

Because an array allows constant-time access to elements, we can implement &lt;code&gt;get-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;set-nth()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, rather than the default implementation's &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt;
   method get-nth(n:Integer):item-type
     return array.get-element(n)
   end method
 
   method set-nth(n:Integer, new-value:item-type)
     array.set-element(n, new-value)
   end method
 end type

=== Bidirectional Lists ===
{{TODO|This is very terse. It should be fleshed out later.}}

Sometimes we want {{FULLPAGENAME}}to move backward in a list too.

&lt;/div&gt;

=== Doubly Linked List Implementation ===
{{TODO|Explain this:
It is part of linked lists that can show the connectivity between the list.
}}

=== Vector Implementation ===
The vector we've already seen has a perfectly adequate implementation to be a Bidirectional List. All we need to do is add the extra member functions to it and its iterator; the old ones don't have to change.

 type Vector&lt;item-type&gt;
   ... # already-existing data and methods

Implement this in terms of the original &lt;code&gt;insert-after()&lt;/code&gt; method. After that runs, we have to adjust &lt;var&gt;iter&lt;/var&gt;'s index so that it still refers to the same element.
   method insert(iter:Bidirectional List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;, &lt;var&gt;new-item&lt;/var&gt;:item-type)
     insert-after(new Vector-Iterator(iter.array, iter.index-1))
     iter.move-next()
   end method

Also implement this on in terms of an old function. After &lt;code&gt;remove-after()&lt;/code&gt; runs, the index will already be correct.
   method remove(iter:Bidirectional List Iterator&lt;item-type&gt;)
     remove-after(new Vector-Iterator(iter.array, iter.index-1))
   end method
 end type

=== Tradeoffs ===
{{TODO|Refactor useful information from below into above

 following outline from talk page:
  Common list operations &amp; example
    set(pos, val), get(pos), remove(pos), append(val)
      [Perhaps discuss operations on Nodes, versus operations on the List
      itself: example, Nodes have a next operation, but the List itself has
      a pointer to the head and tail node, and an integer for the number of
      elements. This view would work well in both the Lisp and OO worlds.]
  Doubley linked list
  Vectors (resizeable arrays)
}}

In order to choose the correct data structure for the job, we need to have some idea of what we're going to *do* with the data.

* Do we know that we'll never have more than 100 pieces of data at any one time, or do we need to occasionally handle gigabytes of data ?
* How will we read the data out ? Always in chronological order ? Always sorted by name ? Randomly accessed by record number ?
* Will we always add/delete data to the end or to the beginning ? Or will we be doing a lot of insertions and deletions in the middle ?

We must strike a balance between the various requirements.
If we need to frequently read data out in 3 different ways, pick a data structure that allows us to do all 3 things not-too-slowly. Don't pick some data structure that's unbearably slow for *one* way, no matter how blazingly fast it is for the other ways.

Often the shortest, simplest programming solution for some task will use a linear (1D) array.

If we keep our data as an ADT, that makes it easier to temporarily switch to some other underlying data structure, and objectively measure whether it's faster or slower.

=== Advantages / Disadvantages ===
For the most part, an advantage of an array is a disadvantage of a linked-list, and vice versa. 

*Array Advantages (vs. Link-Lists)
# ''Index'' - '''Fast access to every element in the array using an index []''', not so with linked list where elements in beginning must be traversed to your desired element.
# ''Faster'' - In general, It is '''faster to access an element in an array''' than accessing an element in a linked-list.
*Link-Lists Advantages (vs. Arrays)
# ''Resize'' - '''Can easily resize the link-list by adding elements''' without affecting the majority of the other elements in the link-list.
# ''Insertion'' - '''Can easily insert an element in the middle of a linked-list,''' (the element is created and then you code pointers to link this element to the other element(s) in the link-list).

Side-note: - '''How to insert an element in the middle of an array'''.
If an array is not full, you take all the elements '''after''' the spot or index in the array you want to insert, and move them forward by 1, then insert your element.
If the array is already full and you want to insert an element, you would have to, in a sense, 'resize the array.'  A new array would have to be made one size larger than the original array to insert your element, then all the elements of the original array are copied to the new array taking into consideration the spot or index to insert your element, then insert your element.

==Trees==
A '''tree''' is a non-empty set one element of which is designated the root of the tree while the remaining elements are partitioned into non-empty sets each of which is a subtree of the root.

Tree nodes have many useful properties.  The '''depth''' of a node is the length of the path (or the number of edges) from the root to that node.  The '''height''' of a node is the longest path from that node to its leaves.  The height of a tree is the height of the root. A '''leaf node''' has no children -- its only path is up to its parent.

See the [[../Tree Axioms|axiomatic development of trees]] and its consequences for more information.

Types of trees:

'''Binary:''' Each node has zero, one, or two children.  This assertion makes many tree operations simple and efficient.

'''Binary Search:''' A binary tree where any left child node has a value less than its parent node and any right child node has a value greater than or equal to that of its parent node.

===Traversal===
Many problems require we visit the nodes of a tree in a systematic way: tasks such as counting how many nodes exist or finding the maximum element. Three different methods are possible for binary trees: ''preorder'', ''postorder'', and ''in-order'', which all do the same three things: recursively traverse both the left and right subtrees and visit the current node. The difference is when the algorithm visits the current node:

'''preorder''': Current node, left subtree, right subtree (DLR)

'''postorder''': Left subtree, right subtree, current node (LRD)

'''in-order''': Left subtree, current node, right subtree (LDR)

'''levelorder''': Level by level, from left to right, starting from the root node.

&amp;#42; Visit means performing some operation involving the current node of a tree, like incrementing a counter or checking if the value of the current node is greater than any other recorded.

===Sample implementations for Tree Traversal===

 '''preorder'''(node)
   visit(node)
   '''if''' node.left  ≠ '''null then''' preorder(node.left)
   '''if''' node.right ≠ '''null then''' preorder(node.right)

 '''inorder'''(node)
   '''if''' node.left  ≠ '''null then''' inorder(node.left)
   visit(node)
   '''if''' node.right ≠ '''null then''' inorder(node.right)

 '''postorder'''(node)
   '''if''' node.left  ≠ '''null then''' postorder(node.left)
   '''if''' node.right ≠ '''null then''' postorder(node.right)
   visit(node)

 '''levelorder'''(root)
   queue&lt;node&gt; q
   q.push(root)
   '''while''' not q.empty '''do'''
      node = q.pop
      visit(node)
      '''if''' node.left  ≠ '''null then''' q.push(node.left)
      '''if''' node.right ≠ '''null then''' q.push(node.right)

For an algorithm that is less taxing on the stack, see Threaded Trees.

===Examples of Tree Traversals===

[[Image:bstreesample.jpg]]

 '''preorder:'''  50,30, 20, 40, 90, 100
 '''inorder:''' 20,30,40,50, 90, 100

===Balancing===
When entries that are already ''sorted'' are stored in a tree, all new records will go the same route, and the tree will look more like a list (such a tree is called a degenerate tree). Therefore the tree needs balancing routines, making sure that under all branches are an equal number of records. This will keep searching in the tree at optimal speed.  Specifically, if a tree with ''n'' nodes is a degenerate tree, the longest path through the tree will be n nodes; if it is a balanced tree, the longest path will be ''log n'' nodes.

[[Algorithms/Left_rotation]]: This shows how balancing is applied to establish a priority heap invariant in  a [[w:Treap|Treap]], a data structure which has the queueing performance of a heap, and the key lookup performance of a tree. A balancing operation can change the tree structure while maintaining another order, which is binary tree sort order. The binary tree order is left to right, with left nodes' keys less than right nodes' keys, whereas the priority order is up and down, with higher nodes' priorities greater than lower nodes' priorities. Alternatively, the priority can be viewed as another ordering key, except that finding a specific key is more involved. 

The balancing operation can move nodes up and down a tree without affecting the left right ordering.
&lt;!--[[Media:left_rotation.svg]]--&gt;

'''[[w:AVL_tree|AVL]]:''' A balanced binary search tree according to the following specification: the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.

'''[[w:Red_black_tree|Red-Black Tree]]:''' A balanced binary search tree using a balancing algorithm based on colors assigned to a node, and the colors of nearby nodes.

''' [[w:AA_tree|AA Tree]]:''' A balanced tree, in fact a more restrictive variation of a red-black tree.

===Binary Search Trees===
A typical binary search tree looks like this:

[[Image:bstreesample.jpg]]

====Terms====
'''Node''' Any item that is stored in the tree.
'''Root''' The top item in the tree. (50 in the tree above)
'''Child''' Node(s) under the current node. (20 and 40 are children of 30 in the tree above)
'''Parent''' The node directly above the current node. (90 is the parent of 100 in the tree above)
'''Leaf''' A node which has no children. (20 is a leaf in the tree above)

====Searching through a binary search tree====
To search for an item in a binary tree:

# Start at the root node
# If the item that you are searching for is less than the root node, move to the left child of the root node, if the item that you are searching for is more than the root node, move to the right child of the root node and if it is equal to the root node, then you have found the item that you are looking for.
# Now check to see if the item that you are searching for is equal to, less than or more than the new node that you are on.  Again if the item that you are searching for is less than the current node, move to the left child, and if the item that you are searching for is greater than the current node, move to the right child.
# Repeat this process until you find the item that you are looking for or until the node does not have a child on the correct branch, in which case the tree doesn't contain the item which you are looking for.

=====Example=====
[[Image:bstreesearchexample.jpg]]

'''For example, to find the node 40...'''

# The root node is 50, which is greater than 40, so you go to 50's left child.
# 50's left child is 30, which is less than 40, so you next go to 30's right child.
# 30's right child is 40, so you have found the item that you are looking for :)
.........

====Adding an item to a binary search tree====
# To add an item, you first must search through the tree to find the position that you should put it in.  You do this following the steps above.
# When you reach a node which doesn't contain a child on the correct branch, add the new node there.



'''For example, to add the node 25...'''

# The root node is 50, which is greater than 25, so you go to 50's left child.
# 50's left child is 30, which is greater than 25, so you go to 30's left child.
# 30's left child is 20, which is less than 25, so you go to 20's right child.
# 20's right child doesn't exist, so you add 25 there :)

====Deleting an item from a binary search tree====
''It is assumed that you have already found the node that you want to delete, using the search technique described above.''

=====Case 1: The node you want to delete is a leaf=====
[[Image:bstreedeleteleafexample.jpg]]

'''For example, to delete 40...'''

* Simply delete the node!

=====Case 2: The node you want to delete has one child=====
# Directly connect the child of the node that you want to delete, to the parent of the node that you want to delete.

[[Image:bstreedeleteonechildexample.jpg]]

'''For example, to delete 90...'''

* Delete 90, then make 100 the child node of 50.

=====Case 3: The node you want to delete has two children=====
One ''non-standard'' way, is to &lt;u&gt;rotate&lt;/u&gt; the node into a chosen subtree, and attempt to delete the key again from that subtree, recursively, until Case 1 or Case 2 occurs. This
could unbalance a tree, so randomly choosing whether to right or left rotate may help.

The ''standard'' way is to pick either the left or right child, say the right, then get the right's leftmost descendent by following left ,starting from the right child, until the next left is null. Then remove this leftmost descendant of the right child, replacing it with its right sub-tree ( it has a left child of null). Then use the contents of this former leftmost descendant of the right child,   as replacement for the key and value of the node being deleted , so that its values now are in the deleted node, the parent of the right child. 
This still maintains the key ordering for all nodes. Example java code is below in the treap example code. 

The following examples use the standard algorithm, that is, the successor is the left-most node in the right subtree of the node to be deleted.

[[Image:bstreefindsuccessorexample.jpg]]

'''For example, to delete 30'''

# The right node of the node which is being deleted is 40.
# (From now on, we continually go to the left node until there isn't another one...) The first left node of 40, is 35.
# 35 has no left node, therefore 35 is the successor!
# 35 replaces 30, at the original right node, and the node with 35 is deleted, replacing it with the right sub-tree, which has the root node 37.

======Case 1 of two-children case: The successor is the right child of the node being deleted======

# Directly move the child to the right of the node being deleted into the position of the node being deleted.
# As the new node has no left children, you can connect the deleted node's left subtree's root as it's left child.

[[Image:bstreedeleterightchildexample.jpg]]

'''For example, to delete 30'''

# replace the contents to be deleted (30), with the successor's contents( 40).
# delete the successor node (contents 40), replacing it with its right subtree (head contents 45).

======Case 2 of two-children case: The successor isn't the right child of the node being deleted======
''This is best shown with an example

[[Image:bstreedeletenotrightchildexample.jpg]]

'''To delete 30...'''

# Replace the  contents to be deleted (30) with the successor's contents (35).
# replace the successor (35) with it's right subtree (37). There is no left subtree because the successor is leftmost.

                 */

	        // more standard method ? doesn't disturb tree structure as much
	        // find leftmost descendant of the right child node and replace contents

			TreapNode n2  = node.right;
			TreapNode previous2 = null;
			while (n2.left != null) {
				previous2 = n2;

			}
 
			if (previous2 != null) {

                                //n2 has no parent link, orphaned
			} else {
				node.right = n2.right;
                               //n2 has no parent link, orphaned
			}
 
			node.k = n2.k;

                        // once n2 out of scope, the orphaned node at n2 will be garbage collected, 
		}
 
		return node;
	}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Red-Black trees ===
A red-black tree is a self-balancing tree structure that applies a color to each of it's nodes.  The structure of a red-black tree must adhere to a set of rules which dictate how nodes of a certain color can be arranged.  The application of these rules is performed when the tree is modified in some way, causing the rotation and recolouring of certain nodes when a new node is inserted or an old node is deleted.  This keeps the red-black tree balanced, guaranteeing a search complexity of O(log ''n'').

The rules that a red-black tree must adhere to are as follows:

# Each node must be either red or black.
# The root is always black.
# All leaves within the tree are black (leaves do not contain data and can be modelled as ''null'' or ''nil'' references in most programming languages).
# Every red node must have two black child nodes.
# Every path from a given node to any of its descendant leaves must contain the same number of black nodes.

A red-black tree can be modelled as 2-3-4 tree , which is a sub-class of B tree (below). A black node with one red node can be seen as linked together as a 3-node , and a black node with 2 red child nodes can be seen as a 4-node.

4-nodes are '''split''' , producing a two node, and the middle node made red, which turns a parent of the middle node which has no red child from a 2-node to a 3-node, and turns a parent with one red child into a 4-node (but this doesn't occur with always left red nodes). 

A in-line arrangement of two red nodes, is '''rotated''' into a parent with two red children, a 4-node, which is later '''split''', as described before. 

       A  &lt;small&gt;right rotate&lt;/small&gt;            &lt;small&gt;'split 4-node'&lt;/small&gt;   |&lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt;
   &lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt; / \    --&gt;        B           ---&gt;    B
     B               &lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt;/ \&lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt;               / \
 &lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt; / \               C   A               C   A
   C   D                 /                   /
                        D                   D

An optimization mentioned by Sedgewick is that all right inserted red nodes are left rotated to become left red nodes, so that only inline left red nodes ever have to be rotated right before splitting. AA-trees (above) by Arne Anderson , described in a paper in 1993 , seem an earlier exposition of the simplification, however he suggested right-leaning 'red marking' instead of left leaning , as suggested by Sedgewick, but AA trees seem to have precedence over left leaning red black trees. It would be quite a shock if the Linux CFS scheduler was described in the future as 'AA based'.

In summary, red-black trees are a way of detecting two insertions into the same side, and levelling out the tree before things get worse . Two left sided insertions will be rotated, and the two right sided insertions, would look like two left sided insertions after left rotation to remove right leaning red nodes. 
Two balanced insertions for the same parent could result in a 4-node split without rotation, so the question arises as to whether a red black tree could be attacked with serial insertions of one sided triads of a &lt; P &lt; b , and then the next triad's P' &lt; a. 

Python illustrative code follows

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;

                        #color rotation is actually a swap

=== B Trees ===
===== Executive Summary =====
* Whereas binary trees have nodes that have two children, with the left child and all of its descendants less than the &quot;value&quot; of the node, and the right child and all of its children more than the &quot;value&quot; of the node, a B-tree is a generalization of this.
* The generalization is that instead of one value, the node has a list of values, and the list is of size n ( n &gt; 2 ). n is chosen to optimize storage , so that a node corresponds in size to a block for instance. This is in the days before ssd drives, but searching binary nodes stored on ssd ram would still be slower than searching ssd ram for a block of values, loading into normal ram and cpu cache, and searching the loaded list.
* At the start of the list, the left child of the first element of the list has a value less than the first element , and so do all its children. To the right of the first element, is a child which has values more than the first element's value, as do all of its children, but also less than the value of the second element. Induction can be used , and this holds so for the child between element 1 and 2, 2 and 3, ... so on until n-1 and nth node.
* To insert into a non-full B tree node, is to do a insertion into a sorted list. 
* In a B+ tree, insertions can only be done in leaf nodes, and non-leaf nodes hold copies of a demarcating value between adjacent child nodes e.g. the left most value of an element's right child's list of nodes.
* Whenever a list becomes full e.g. there are n nodes, the node is &quot;split&quot;, and this means making two new nodes, and passing the demarcating value upto the parent.

B Trees were described originally as generalizations of binary search trees , where a binary tree is a 2-node B-Tree, the 2 standing for two children, with 2-1 = 1 key separating the 2 children. Hence a 3-node has 2 values separating 3 children, and a N node has N children separated by N-1 keys. 

A classical B-Tree can have N-node internal nodes, and empty 2-nodes as leaf nodes, or more conveniently,
the children can either be a value or a pointer to the next N-node, so it is a union. 

The main idea with B-trees is that one starts with a root N-node , which is able to hold N-1 entries,
but on the Nth entry, the number of keys for the node is exhausted, and the node can be split into two
half sized N/2 sized N nodes, separated by a single key K, which is equal to the right node's leftmost key,
so any entry with key K2 equal or greater than K goes in the right node, and anything less than K goes in the left. When the root node is split, a new root node is created with one key, and a left child and a right child. Since there are N children but only N-1 entries, the leftmost child is stored as a separate pointer.
If the leftmost pointer splits, then the left half becomes the new leftmost pointer, and the right half and separating key is inserted into the front of the entries.

An alternative is the B+ tree which is the most commonly used in database systems, because only values are stored in leaf nodes, whereas internal nodes only store keys and pointers to other nodes, putting a limit
on the size of the datum value as the size of a pointer. This often allows internal nodes with more entries able to fit a certain block size, e.g. 4K is a common physical disc block size. Hence , if a B+ tree internal node is aligned to a physical disc block, then the main rate limiting factor of reading a block of  a large index from disc because it isn't cached in a memory list of blocks is reduced to one block read.

A B+ tree has bigger internal nodes, so is wider and shorter in theory than an equivalent B tree which
must fit all nodes within a given physical block size, hence overall it is a faster index due to greater fan out and less height to reach keys on average.

Apparently, this fan out is so important, compression can also be applied to the blocks to increase the number of entries fitting within a given underlying layer's block
size (the underlying layer is often a filesystem block).

Most database systems use the B+ tree algorithm, including postgresql, mysql, derbydb, firebird, many Xbase index types, etc.

Many filesystems also use a B+ tree to manage their block layout (e.g. xfs, NTFS, etc).

Transwiki has a java implementation of a B+ Tree which uses traditional arrays as key list and value list. 

Below is an example of a B Tree with test driver, and a B+  tree with a test driver. The memory / disc management is not included, but a usable hacked example can be found 
at [[/Hashing Memory Checking Example/]].

This B+ tree implementation  was written out of the B Tree , and the difference from the transwiki B+ tree is that it tries to use the semantics of SortedMap and SortedSet already present in the standard Java collections library. 

Hence , the flat leaf block list of this B+ implementation can't contain blocks that don't contain any data, because the ordering depends on the first key of the entries, so a leaf block needs to be created with its first entry.

==== A B+ tree java example ====

Experiments include timing the run ( e.g. time java -cp . btreemap.BPlusTreeTest1 ) , using an external blocksize + 1 sized leaf block size, so that
this is basically the underlying entries TreeMap only , vs , say,  400 internal node size, and 200 external node size .
Other experiments include using a SkipListMap instead of a TreeMap.

=== Treaps ===
The invariant in a binary tree is that left is less than right with respect to insertion keys. e.g. for a key with order, ord(L) &lt; ord(R).
This doesn't dictate the relationship of nodes however, and left and right rotation does not affect the above.
Therefore another order can be imposed. If the order is randomised, it is likely to counteract any skewness of a plain binary tree
e.g. when inserting an already sorted input in order.

Below is a java example implementation, including a plain binary tree delete code example.

A '''hash table''', or a '''hash map''', is a data structure that associates ''keys'' with ''values''. The primary operation it supports efficiently is a ''lookup'': given a key (e.g. a person's name), find the corresponding value (e.g. that person's telephone number). It works by transforming the key using a [[w:hash function|hash function]] into a ''hash'', a number that the hash table uses to locate the desired value. This hash maps directly to a bucket in the array of key/value pairs, hence the name hash map. The mapping method lets us directly access the storage location for any key/value pair.

=== Time complexity and common uses of hash tables ===
Hash tables are often used to implement [[w:associative array|associative array]]s, [[w:Set (computer science)|sets]] and [[w:cache|cache]]s. Like [[w:array|array]]s, hash tables provide constant-time [[w:Big-O notation|O(1)]] lookup on average, regardless of the number of items in the table. The (hopefully rare) worst-case lookup time in most hash table schemes is O(''n'').&lt;ref&gt;
The simplest hash table schemes --
&quot;open addressing with linear probing&quot;,
&quot;separate chaining with linked lists&quot;,
etc. --
have O(''n'') lookup time in the the worst case where (accidentally or maliciously) most keys &quot;collide&quot; -- most keys are hashed to one or a few buckets.

Other hash table schemes --
&quot;cuckoo hashing&quot;, &quot;dynamic perfect hashing&quot;, etc. --
guarantee O(1) lookup time even in the worst case.
When a new key is inserted, such schemes change their hash function whenever necessary to avoid collisions.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Compared to other associative array data structures, hash tables are most useful when we need to store a large numbers of data records.

Hash tables may be used as in-memory data structures. Hash tables may also be adopted for use with [[w:persistent data structure|persistent data structure]]s; database indexes commonly use disk-based data structures based on hash tables.

Hash tables are also used to speed-up string searching in many implementations of [[Data Compression/Dictionary compression#hash tables|data compression]].

In [[w:computer chess|computer chess]], a hash table can be used to implement the [[w:transposition table|transposition table]].

=== Choosing a good hash function ===
A good hash function is essential for good hash table performance. A poor choice of hash function is likely to lead to ''clustering'' behavior, in which the probability of keys mapping to the same hash bucket (i.e. a ''collision'') is significantly greater than would be expected from a random function. A nonzero probability of collisions is inevitable in any hash implementation, but the number of operations to resolve collisions usually scales linearly with the number of keys mapping to the same bucket, so excess collisions will degrade performance significantly. In addition, some hash functions are computationally expensive, so the amount of time (and, in some cases, memory) taken to compute the hash may be burdensome.

Choosing a good hash function is tricky. The literature is replete with poor choices, at least when measured by modern standards. For example, the very popular multiplicative hash advocated by Knuth in The Art of Computer Programming (see reference below) has particularly poor clustering behavior. However, since poor hashing merely degrades hash table performance for particular input key distributions, such problems go undetected far too often.

The literature is also sparse on the criteria for choosing a hash function. Unlike most other fundamental algorithms and data structures, there is no universal consensus on what makes a &quot;good&quot; hash function. The remainder of this section is organized by three criteria: simplicity, speed, and strength, and will survey algorithms known to perform well by these criteria.

Simplicity and speed are readily measured objectively (by number of lines of code and CPU benchmarks, for example), but strength is a more slippery concept. Obviously, a [[w:Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash function]] such as SHA-1 would satisfy the relatively lax strength requirements needed for hash tables, but their slowness and complexity makes them unappealing. In fact, even a cryptographic hash does not provide protection against an adversary who wishes to degrade hash table performance by choosing keys all hashing to the same bucket. For these specialized cases, a [[universal hash function]] should be used instead of any one static hash, no matter how sophisticated.

In the absence of a standard measure for hash function strength, the current state of the art is to employ a battery of [[Statistics|statistical]] tests to measure whether the hash function can be readily distinguished from a random function. Arguably the most important such test is to determine whether the hash function displays the [[avalanche effect]], which essentially states that any single-bit change in the input key should affect on average half the bits in the output. Bret Mulvey advocates testing the ''strict avalanche condition'' in particular, which states that, for any single-bit change, each of the output bits should change with probability one-half, independent of the other bits in the key. Purely additive hash functions such as [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC]] fail this stronger condition miserably.

Clearly, a strong hash function should have a [[uniform distribution]] of hash values. Bret Mulvey proposes the use of a chi-squared test for uniformity, based on [[power of two]] hash table sizes ranging from 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;. This test is considerably more sensitive than many others proposed for measuring hash functions, and finds problems in many popular hash functions.

Fortunately, there are good hash functions that satisfy all these criteria. The simplest class all consume one byte of the input key per iteration of the inner loop. Within this class, simplicity and speed are closely related, as fast algorithms simply don't have time to perform complex calculations. Of these, one that performs particularly well is the Jenkins One-at-a-time hash, adapted here from [http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html an article by Bob Jenkins], its creator.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
  uint32 joaat_hash(uchar *key, size_t len)
  {
    uint32 hash = 0;
    size_t i;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; len; i++)
    {
        hash += key[i];
        hash += (hash &lt;&lt; 10);
        hash ^= (hash &gt;&gt; 6);
    }
    hash += (hash &lt;&lt; 3);
    hash ^= (hash &gt;&gt; 11);
    hash += (hash &lt;&lt; 15);
    return hash;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Image:JenkinsOneAtATime-3.svg|thumb|255px|right|Avalanche behavior of Jenkins One-at-a-time hash over 3-byte keys]]

The avalanche behavior of this hash shown on the right. The image was made using Bret Mulvey's AvalancheTest in his [https://archive.is/20130703050807/bretm.home.comcast.net/hash/11.html Hash.cs toolset]. Each row corresponds to a single bit in the input, and each column to a bit in the output. A green square indicates good mixing behavior, a yellow square weak mixing behavior, and red would indicate no mixing. Only a few bits in the last byte are weakly mixed, a performance vastly better than a number of widely used hash functions.

Many commonly used hash functions perform poorly when subjected to such rigorous avalanche testing. The widely favored [[Fowler Noll Vo hash|FNV]] hash, for example, shows many bits with no mixing at all, especially for short keys. See the [http://web.archive.org/web/20060116075140/http://bretm.home.comcast.net/hash/6.html evaluation of FNV] by Bret Mulvey for a more thorough analysis.

If speed is more important than simplicity, then the class of hash functions which consume multibyte chunks per iteration may be of interest. One of the most sophisticated is &quot;lookup3&quot; by Bob Jenkins, which consumes input in 12 byte (96 bit) chunks. Note, though, that any speed improvement from the use of this hash is only likely to be useful for large keys, and that the increased complexity may also have speed consequences such as preventing an optimizing compiler from inlining the hash function. Bret Mulvey analyzed an [http://web.archive.org/web/20060116065454/http://bretm.home.comcast.net/hash/7.html earlier version, lookup2], and found it to have excellent avalanche behavior.

One desirable property of a hash function is that conversion from the hash value (typically 32 bits) to an bucket index for a particular-size hash table can be done simply by masking, preserving only the lower k bits for a table of size 2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; (an operation equivalent to computing the hash value [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] the table size). This property enables the technique of incremental doubling of the size of the hash table - each bucket in the old table maps to only two in the new table. Because of its use of XOR-folding, the FNV hash does not have this property. Some older hashes are even worse, requiring table sizes to be a prime number rather than a power of two, again computing the bucket index as the hash value modulo the table size. In general, such a requirement is a sign of a fundamentally weak function; using a prime table size is a poor substitute for using a stronger function.

=== Collision resolution ===
If two keys hash to the same index, the corresponding records cannot be stored in the same location. So, if it's already occupied, we must find another location to store the new record, and do it so that we can find it when we look it up later on.

To give an idea of the importance of a good collision resolution strategy, consider the following result, derived using the [[w:Birthday_paradox#Generalization|birthday paradox]]. Even if we assume that our hash function outputs random indices [[w:Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly distributed]] over the array, and even for an array with 1 million entries, there is a 95% chance of at least one collision occurring before it contains 2500 records.

There are a number of collision resolution techniques, but the most popular are ''chaining'' and ''open addressing''.

==== Chaining ====

[[Image:HASHTB32.svg|thumb|362px|right|Hash collision resolved by chaining.]]

In the simplest chained hash table technique, each slot in the array references a [[linked list]] of inserted records that collide to the same slot. Insertion requires finding the correct slot, and appending to either end of the list in that slot; deletion requires searching the list and removal.

Chained hash tables have advantages over open addressed hash tables in that the removal operation is simple and resizing the table can be postponed for a much longer time because performance [[w:graceful degradation|degrades more gracefully]] even when every slot is used. Indeed, many chaining hash tables may not require resizing at all since performance degradation is linear as the table fills. For example, a chaining hash table containing twice its recommended capacity of data would only be about twice as slow on average as the same table at its recommended capacity.

Chained hash tables inherit the disadvantages of linked lists. When storing small records, the overhead of the linked list can be significant. An additional disadvantage is that traversing a linked list has poor [[w:Locality of reference|cache performance]].

Alternative data structures can be used for chains instead of linked lists. By using a [[w:Self-balancing binary search tree|self-balancing tree]], for example, the theoretical worst-case time of a hash table can be brought down to O(log ''n'') rather than O(''n''). However, since each list is intended to be short, this approach is usually inefficient unless the hash table is designed to run at full capacity or there are unusually high collision rates, as might occur in input designed to cause collisions. [[Dynamic array]]s can also be used to decrease space overhead and improve cache performance when records are small.

Some chaining implementations use an optimization where the first record of each chain is stored in the table. Although this can increase performance, it is generally not recommended: chaining tables with reasonable load factors contain a large proportion of empty slots, and the larger slot size causes them to waste large amounts of space.

==== Open addressing ====
[[Image:HASHTB12.svg|thumb|362px|right|Hash collision resolved by linear probing (interval=1).]]
Open addressing hash tables can store the records directly within the array. A hash collision is resolved by ''probing'', or searching through alternate locations in the array (the ''probe sequence'') until either the target record is found, or an unused array slot is found, which indicates that there is no such key in the table. Well known probe sequences include:

; [[linear probing]] : in which the interval between probes is fixed—often at 1,
; [[quadratic probing]] : in which the interval between probes increases linearly (hence, the indices are described by a quadratic function), and
; [[double hashing]] : in which the interval between probes is fixed for each record but is computed by another hash function.

The main tradeoffs between these methods are that linear probing has the best cache performance but is most sensitive to clustering, while double hashing has poor cache performance but exhibits virtually no clustering; quadratic hashing falls in-between in both areas. Double hashing can also require more computation than other forms of probing.  Some open addressing methods, such as
[[last-come-first-served hashing]] and [[cuckoo hashing]] move existing keys around in the array to make room for the new key. This gives better maximum search times than the methods based on probing.

A critical influence on performance of an open addressing hash table is the ''load factor''; that is, the proportion of the slots in the array that are used. As the load factor increases towards 100%, the number of probes that may be required to find or insert a given key rises dramatically. Once the table becomes full, probing algorithms may even fail to terminate. Even with good hash functions, load factors are normally limited to 80%. A poor hash function can exhibit poor performance even at very low load factors by generating significant clustering. What causes hash functions to cluster is not well understood, and it is easy to unintentionally write a hash function which causes severe clustering. 

===== Example pseudocode =====

The following [[w:pseudocode|pseudocode]] is an implementation of an open addressing hash table with linear probing and single-slot stepping, a common approach that is effective if the hash function is good. Each of the '''lookup''', '''set''' and '''remove''' functions use a common internal function '''findSlot''' to locate the array slot that either does or should contain a given key.

  '''record''' pair { key, value }
  '''var''' ''pair array'' slot[0..numSlots-1]
  
  '''function''' findSlot(key)
      i := hash(key) modulus numSlots
      '''loop'''
          '''if''' slot[i] is not occupied '''or''' slot[i].key = key
              '''return''' i
          i := (i + 1) modulus numSlots
  
  '''function''' lookup(key)
      i := findSlot(key)
      '''if''' slot[i] is occupied   ''// key is in table''
          '''return''' slot[i].value
      '''else'''                     ''// key is not in table''
          '''return''' not found     
  
  '''function''' set(key, value)
      i := findSlot(key)
      '''if''' slot[i] is occupied
          slot[i].value := value
      '''else'''
          '''if''' the table is almost full
              rebuild the table larger ''(note 1)''
              i := findSlot(key)
          slot[i].key   := key
          slot[i].value := value

Another example showing open addressing technique. Presented function is converting each part(4) of an Internet protocol address, where NOT is bitwise NOT, XOR is bitwise XOR, OR is bitwise OR, AND is bitwise AND and &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; are shift-left and shift-right:

  ''// key_1,key_2,key_3,key_4 are following 3-digit numbers - parts of ip address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx''
  '''function''' ip(key parts)
      j := 1
      '''do'''
          key := (key_2 &lt;&lt; 2)
          key := (key + (key_3 &lt;&lt; 7))
          key := key + (j OR key_4 &gt;&gt; 2) * (key_4) * (j + key_1) XOR j
          key := key AND _prime_	''// _prime_ is a prime number''
          j := (j+1) 
      '''while''' collision
      '''return''' key

; note 1 : Rebuilding the table requires allocating a larger array and recursively using the '''set''' operation to insert all the elements of the old array into the new larger array. It is common to increase the array size [[exponential growth|exponentially]], for example by doubling the old array size.

  '''function''' remove(key)
      i := findSlot(key)
      '''if''' slot[i] is unoccupied
          return   ''// key is not in the table''
      j := i

      mark slot[i] as unoccupied

; note 2 : For all records in a cluster, there must be no vacant slots between their natural hash position and their current position (else lookups will terminate before finding the record). At this point in the pseudocode, ''i'' is a vacant slot that might be invalidating this property for subsequent records in the cluster. ''j'' is such as subsequent record. ''k'' is the raw hash where the record at ''j'' would naturally land in the hash table if there were no collisions. This test is asking if the record at ''j'' is invalidly positioned with respect to the required properties of a cluster now that ''i'' is vacant.

Another technique for removal is simply to mark the slot as deleted. However this eventually requires rebuilding the table simply to remove deleted records. The methods above provide O(1) updating and removal of existing records, with occasional rebuilding if the high water mark of the table size grows.

The O(1) remove method above is only possible in linearly probed hash tables with single-slot stepping.  In the case where many records are to be deleted in one operation, marking the slots for deletion and later rebuilding may be more efficient.

==== Open addressing versus chaining ====
Chained hash tables have the following benefits over open addressing:
* They are simple to implement effectively and only require basic data structures.
* From the point of view of writing suitable hash functions, chained hash tables are insensitive to clustering, only requiring minimization of collisions. Open addressing depends upon better hash functions to avoid clustering. This is particularly important if novice programmers can add their own hash functions, but even experienced programmers can be caught out by unexpected clustering effects.
* They degrade in performance more gracefully. Although chains grow longer as the table fills, a chained hash table cannot &quot;fill up&quot; and does not exhibit the sudden increases in lookup times that occur in a near-full table with open addressing. (''see right'')
* If the hash table stores large records, about 5 or more words per record, chaining uses less memory than open addressing.
* If the hash table is sparse (that is, it has a big array with many free array slots), chaining uses less memory than open addressing even for small records of 2 to 4 words per record due to its external storage.

[[Image:Hash table average insertion time.png|thumb|right|362px|This graph compares the average number of cache misses required to lookup elements in tables with chaining and linear probing. As the table passes the 80%-full mark, linear probing's performance drastically degrades.]]

For small record sizes (a few words or less) the benefits of in-place open addressing compared to chaining are:
* They can be more space-efficient than chaining since they don't need to store any pointers or allocate any additional space outside the hash table. Simple linked lists require a word of overhead per element.
* Insertions avoid the time overhead of memory allocation, and can even be implemented in the absence of a memory allocator.
* Because it uses internal storage, open addressing avoids the extra indirection required for chaining's external storage. It also has better [[w:locality of reference|locality of reference]], particularly with linear probing. With small record sizes, these factors can yield better performance than chaining, particularly for lookups.
* They can be easier to [[w:serialization|serialize]], because they don't use pointers.

On the other hand, normal open addressing is a poor choice for large elements, since these elements fill entire cache lines (negating the cache advantage), and a large amount of space is wasted on large empty table slots. If the open addressing table only stores references to elements (external storage), it uses space comparable to chaining even for large records but loses its speed advantage.

Generally speaking, open addressing is better used for hash tables with small records that can be stored within the table (internal storage) and fit in a cache line. They are particularly suitable for elements of one word or less. In cases where the tables are expected to have high load factors, the records are large, or the data is variable-sized, chained hash tables often perform as well or better.

Ultimately, used sensibly any kind of hash table algorithm is usually fast ''enough''; and the percentage of a calculation spent in hash table code is low. Memory usage is rarely considered excessive. Therefore, in most cases the differences between these algorithms is marginal, and other considerations typically come into play.

==== Coalesced hashing ====
{{main|Coalesced hashing}}

A hybrid of chaining and open addressing, coalesced hashing links together chains of nodes within the table itself. Like open addressing, it achieves space usage and (somewhat diminished) cache advantages over chaining. Like chaining, it does not exhibit clustering effects; in fact, the table can be efficiently filled to a high density. Unlike chaining, it cannot have more elements than table slots.

==== Perfect hashing ====
{{main|Perfect hashing}}

If all of the keys that will be used are known ahead of time, and there are no more keys that can fit the hash table, [[perfect hashing]] can be used to create a perfect hash table, in which there will be no collisions. If [[minimal perfect hashing]] is used, every location in the hash table can be used as well.

Perfect hashing gives a hash table where the time to make a lookup is constant in the worst case. This is in contrast to chaining and open addressing methods, where the time for lookup is low on average, but may be arbitrarily large. There exist methods for maintaining a perfect hash function under insertions of keys, known as [[dynamic perfect hashing]]. A simpler alternative, that also gives worst case constant lookup time, is [[cuckoo hashing]].

==== Probabilistic hashing ====
Perhaps the simplest solution to a collision is to replace the value that is already in the slot with the new value, or slightly less commonly, drop the record that is to be inserted. In later searches, this may result in a search not finding a record which has been inserted. This technique is particularly useful for implementing caching.

An even more space-efficient solution which is similar to this is use a [[w:bit array|bit array]] (an array of one-bit fields) for our table. Initially all bits are set to zero, and when we insert a key, we set the corresponding bit to one. False negatives cannot occur, but [[false positives]] can, since if the search finds a 1 bit, it will claim that the value was found, even if it was just another value that hashed into the same array slot by coincidence. In reality, such a hash table is merely a specific type of [[w:Bloom filter|Bloom filter]].

=== Table resizing ===

With a good hash function, a hash table can typically contain about 70%&amp;ndash;80% as many elements as it does table slots and still perform well. Depending on the collision resolution mechanism, performance can begin to suffer either gradually or dramatically as more elements are added. To deal with this, when the load factor exceeds some threshold, we allocate a new, larger table, and add all the contents of the original table to this new table. In [[Java programming language|Java]]'s HashMap class, for example, the default load factor threshold is 0.75.

This can be a very expensive operation, and the necessity for it is one of the hash table's disadvantages. In fact, some naive methods for doing this, such as enlarging the table by one each time you add a new element, reduce performance so drastically as to make the hash table useless. However, if we enlarge the table by some fixed percent, such as 10% or 100%, it can be shown using [[amortized analysis]] that these resizings are so infrequent that the average time per lookup remains constant-time. To see why this is true, suppose a hash table using chaining begins at the minimum size of 1 and is doubled each time it fills above 100%. If in the end it contains ''n'' elements, then the total add operations performed for all the resizings is:

:1 + 2 + 4 + ... + ''n'' = 2''n'' - 1.

Because the costs of the resizings form a [[geometric series]], the total cost is O(''n''). But we also perform ''n'' operations to add the ''n'' elements in the first place, so the total time to add ''n'' elements with resizing is O(''n''), an amortized time of O(1) per element.

On the other hand, some hash table implementations, notably in [[real-time system]]s, cannot pay the price of enlarging the hash table all at once, because it may interrupt time-critical operations. One simple approach is to initially allocate the table with enough space for the expected number of elements and forbid the addition of too many elements. Another useful but more memory-intensive technique is to perform the resizing gradually:
* Allocate the new hash table, but leave the old hash table and check both tables during lookups.
* Each time an insertion is performed, add that element to the new table and also move ''k'' elements from the old table to the new table.
* When all elements are removed from the old table, deallocate it.
To ensure that the old table will be completely copied over before the new table itself needs to be enlarged, it's necessary to increase the size of the table by a factor of at least (''k'' + 1)/''k'' during the resizing.

[[Linear hashing]] is a hash table algorithm that permits incremental hash table expansion.  It is implemented using a single hash table, but with two possible look-up functions.

Another way to decrease the cost of table resizing is to choose a hash function in such a way that the hashes of most values do not change when the table is resized. This approach, called [[consistent hashing]], is prevalent in disk-based and distributed hashes, where resizing is prohibitively costly.

=== Ordered retrieval issue ===
Hash tables store data in pseudo-random locations, so accessing the data in a sorted manner is a very time consuming operation. Other data structures such as [[self-balancing binary search tree]]s generally operate more slowly (since their lookup time is O(log ''n'')) and are rather more complex to implement than hash tables but maintain a sorted data structure at all times. See [[Associative_array#Efficient_representations|a comparison of hash tables and self-balancing binary search trees]].

=== Problems with hash tables ===
Although hash table lookups use constant time on average, the time spent can be significant. Evaluating a good hash function can be a slow operation. In particular, if simple array indexing can be used instead, this is usually faster.

Hash tables in general exhibit poor [[locality of reference]]&amp;mdash;that is, the data to be accessed is distributed seemingly at random in memory. Because hash tables cause access patterns that jump around, this can trigger [[CPU cache|microprocessor cache]] misses that cause long delays. Compact data structures such as arrays, searched with [[linear search]], may be faster if the table is relatively small and keys are cheap to compare, such as with simple integer keys. According to [[Moore's Law]], cache sizes are growing exponentially and so what is considered &quot;small&quot; may be increasing. The optimal performance point varies from system to system; for example, a trial on [[Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]] shows that its hash tables outperform linear search in all but the most trivial cases (one to three entries).

More significantly, hash tables are more difficult and error-prone to write and use. Hash tables require the design of an effective hash function for each key type, which in many situations is more difficult and time-consuming to design and debug than the mere comparison function required for a [[self-balancing binary search tree]]. In open-addressed hash tables it's even easier to create a poor hash function.

Additionally, in some applications, a [[black hat]] with knowledge of the hash function may be able to supply information to a hash which creates worst-case behavior by causing excessive collisions, resulting in very poor performance (i.e., a [[denial of service attack]]). In critical applications, either [[universal hashing]] can be used or a data structure with better worst-case guarantees may be preferable. For details, see Crosby and Wallach's ''[http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf Denial of Service via Algorithmic Complexity Attacks]''.

=== Other hash table algorithms ===
'''Extendible hashing''' and '''linear hashing''' are hash algorithms that are used in the context of database algorithms used for instance in index file structures, and even primary file organization for a database. Generally, in order to make search scalable for large databases, the search time should be proportional log N or near constant, where N is the number of records to search. Log N searches can be implemented with tree structures, because the degree of fan out and the shortness of the tree relates to the number of steps needed to find a record, so the height of the tree is the maximum number of disc accesses it takes to find where a record is.
However, hash tables are also used, because the cost of a disk access can be counted in units of disc accesses, and often that unit is a block of data. Since a hash table can, in the best case, find a key with one or two accesses, a hash table index is regarded as generally faster when retrieving a collection of records during a join operation e.g. 
 SELECT * from customer, orders where customer.cust_id = orders.cust_id and cust_id = X
i.e. If orders has a hash index on cust_id, then it takes constant time to locate the block that contains record locations for orders matching cust_id = X. (although, it would be better if the value type of orders was a list of order ids, so that hash keys are just one unique cust_id for each batch of orders, to avoid unnecessary collisions). 

Extendible hashing and linear hashing have certain similarities: collisions are accepted as inevitable and are part of the algorithm where blocks or buckets of collision space is added ; traditional good hash function ranges are required, but the hash value is transformed by a dynamic address function : in '''extendible hashing''',
a bit mask is used to mask out unwanted bits, but this mask length increases by one periodically, doubling the
available addressing space ; also in extendible hashing, there is an indirection with a directory address space, the directory entries being paired with another address (a pointer ) to the actual block containing the key-value pairs; the entries in the directory correspond to the bit masked hash value (so that the number of entries is equal to maximum bit mask value + 1 e.g. a bit mask of 2 bits, can address a directory of 00 01 10 11, or 3 + 1 = 4).  

In '''linear hashing''', the traditional hash value is also masked with a bit mask, but
if the resultant smaller hash value falls below a 'split' variable, the original hash value is masked with
a bit mask of one bit greater length, making the resultant hash value address recently added blocks. The split variable ranges incrementally between 0 and the maximum current bit mask value e.g. a bit mask of 2, or in the terminology of linear hashing, a &quot;level&quot; of 2, the split variable will range between 0 to 3. When the split variable reaches 4, the level increases by 1, so in the next round of the split variable, it will range between 0 to 7, and reset again when it reaches 8. 

The split variable incrementally allows increased addressing space, as new blocks are added; the decision to add a new block occurs whenever a key-and=value is being inserted, and overflows the particular block the key-and-value's key hashes into. This overflow location may be completely unrelated to the block going to be split pointed to by the split variable. However, over time, it is expected that given a good random hash function that distributes entries fairly evenly amongst all addressable blocks,
the blocks that actually require splitting because they have overflowed get their turn in round-robin fashion as the split value ranges between 0 - N where N has a factor of 2 to the power of Level, level being the variable incremented whenever the split variable hits N. 

New blocks are added one at a time with both extendible hashing, and with linear hashing.
 
In '''extendible hashing''',  a block overflow ( a new key-value colliding with B other key-values, where B is the size of a block) is handled by checking the size of the bit mask &quot;locally&quot;, called the &quot;local depth&quot;, an attribute which must be stored with the block. The directory structure, also has a depth, the &quot;global depth&quot;. If the local depth is less than the global depth, then the local depth is incremented, and all the key values are rehashed and passed through a bit mask which is one bit longer now, placing them either in the current block, or in another block. 
If the other block happens to be the same block when looked up in the directory, a new block is added, and the directory entry for the other block is made to point to the new block. Why does the directory have entries where two entries point to the same block ? This is because if the local depth '''is equal to'''  the global depth of the directory, this means the bit mask of the directory does not have enough bits to deal with an increment in the bit mask length of the block, and so the directory must have its bit mask length incremented, but this means the directory now doubles the number of addressable entries. Since half the entries addressable don't exist, the directory simply copies the pointers over to the new entries e.g. if the directory had entries for 00, 01, 10, 11, or a 2 bit mask, and it becomes a 3 bit mask, then 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 become the new entries, and  00's block address go to 000 and 001 ; 01's pointer goes to 010 and 011, 10 goes to 100 and 101 and so on.  And so this creates the situation where two directory entries point to the same block. Although the block that was going to overflow, now can add a new block by redirecting the second pointer to a newly appended block, the other original blocks will have two pointers to them. When it is their turn to split, the algorithm will check local vs global depth and this time find that the local depth is less, and hence no directory splitting is required, only a new block be appended, and the second directory pointer moved from addressing the previous block to addressing the new block.

In '''linear hashing''', adding a similarly hashed block does not occurs  immediately when a block overflows, and therefore an overflow block is created to be attached to the overflowing block. However, a block overflow is a signal that more space will be required, and this happens by splitting the block pointed to by the &quot;split&quot; variable, which is initially zero, and hence initially points to block zero. The splitting is done by taking all the key-value pairs in the
splitting block, and its overflow block(s), hashing the keys again, but with a bit mask of length current level + 1. This will result in
two block addresses, some will be the old block number, and others will be
 a2 = old block number + ( N times 2 ^ (level) )

;Rationale
Let m  = N times 2 ^ level ; if h is the original hash value, and old block number = h mod m, and now the new block number is h mod ( m * 2 ), because m * 2 = N times 2 ^ (level+1), then the new block number is either h mod m if (h / m) is even so dividing h/m by 2 leaves a zero remainder and therefore doesn't change the remainder, or the new block number is ( h mod m )  + m because h / m is an odd number, and dividing h / m by 2 will leave an excess remainder of m, + the original remainder. ( The same rationale applies to extendible hashing depth incrementing ).

As above, a new block is created with a number a2, which will usually occur at +1 the previous a2 value. 
Once this is done, the split variable is incremented, so that the next a2 value will be again old a2 + 1. In this way, each block is covered by the split variable eventually, so each block is preemptively rehashed into extra space, and new blocks are added incrementally. Overflow blocks that are no longer needed are discarded, for later garbage collection if needed, or put on an available free block list by chaining.  

When the split variable reaches ( N times 2 ^ level ), level is incremented and split variable is reset to zero. 
In this next round, the split variable will now traverse from zero to ( N times 2 ^ (old_level + 1 ) ), 
which is exactly the number of blocks at the start of the previous round, but including all the blocks created by the previous round.

==== A simple inference on file storage mapping of linear hashing and extendible hashing ====
As can be seen, extendible hashing requires space to store a directory which can double in size. 

Since the space of both algorithms increase by one block at a time, if blocks have a known maximum size or fixed size, then it is straight forward to map the blocks as blocks sequentially appended to a file. 

In extendible hashing, it would  be logical to store the directory as a separate file, as doubling can be accommodated by adding to the end of the directory file. The separate block file would not have to change, other than have blocks appended to its end. 

Header information for linear hashing doesn't increase in size :  basically just the values for 
N, level, and split need to be recorded, so these can be incorporated as a header into a fixed block size linear hash storage file.
 
However, linear hashing requires space for overflow blocks, and this might best be stored in another file,
otherwise addressing blocks in the linear hash file is not as straight forward as multiplying the block number by the block size and adding the space for N,level, and split. 

 
In the next section, a complete example of linear hashing in Java is given, using a in memory implementation of linear hashing, and code to manage blocks as files in a file directory, the whole contents of the file directory representing the persistent linear hashing structure.

=== Implementations ===
While many programming languages already provide hash table functionality,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wikipedia: Comparison of programming languages (mapping)]] shows how many programming languages provide hash table functionality.
&lt;/ref&gt;
there are several independent implementations worth mentioning.
* [http://goog-sparsehash.sourceforge.net/ Google Sparse Hash] The Google SparseHash project contains several hash-map implementations in use at Google, with different performance characteristics, including an implementation that optimizes for space and one that optimizes for speed. The memory-optimized one is extremely memory-efficient with only 2 bits/entry of overhead.
* [https://launchpad.net/libmct MCT] provides hashtables similar to Google's &lt;code&gt;dense_hash_map&lt;/code&gt;, but without restriction on contained values; it also comes with exception safety and support for C++0x features.
* A number of runtime languages and/or standard libraries use hash tables to implement their support for associative arrays because of their efficiency.

==== A python implementation of extendible hashing ====
The file - block management routines aren't there, so this could be added in to make this a real implementation of a database hash index.

A full page is split according to the (local depth)th bit, first by collecting all the directory indices pointing to the full page, updating the pointers according to
the d bit being 0 or 1 corresponding to first and second new pages, then reloading all the key-values after hashing each key and using the d bit of each hash to see which page to allocate to. The local depth of each new page is one greater than the old page's local depth, so that the next d bit can be used next time when splitting.

==== A Java implementation of linear hashing ====
( usable for simple database indexing of arbitrary size, (almost ?) )
 
This code evolved out of a need for a bigger Java HashMap. Originally, a Java HashMap standard object was used as a Map
to index a heap like database file ( DBF format). But then, a file was encountered with so many records that the OutOfMemoryError
was being thrown, so linear hashing seemed like a reasonably simple algorithm to use as a disk based index scheme. 

Initially, linear hashing was implemented behind the Java Map interface, mainly the put(k,v) and get(k,v) methods. Generics was used, in order
not to get too involved in the key and value details. 

====== debugging to achieve functionality ======
Custom dumps to System.err was used to verify that blocks were being created, filled, and overflow blocks were of expected number if they existed ( no. = 1 ).
This was all done in a purely in-memory implementation.

Later, the standard Java decoupling was introduced, where the original LHMap2 class accepted listeners to events, such as when a block was needed. The listener was then implemented as a block file manager, loading blocks into the block list of the memory LHMap2 object whenever a null block was encountered on the block list,
and checking whether virtual machine runtime free memory was low, and retiring blocks using just a basic first-to-last-listed cache removal algorithm
(not least recently used (LRU), not least often used ) by saving them to disk file, and then actively invoking the system garbage collector.

Because an application use case existed, which was to externally index a large DBF table, this use case was used as the main test harness for the algorithm implementation.

Each block is a file in this implementation, because blocks are variably sized here to account for generics and variable sized key and value pairs, and overflow blocks are conceptual, not actual as on disc storage, because the block's contents and that of its overflow bucket(s), are saved as a list of alternating keys and values in this implementation. Methods for saving and loading to Object streams was used in a standard java customized object persistence way by implementing the Externalizable interface
in the Block data class.

:関東弁 (''kantouben'') is generally regarded as standard Japanese. It seems to only differ, however, in slang used and some pronunciation. Nevertheless, it is a dialect in its own right, especially when compared to the other variations of Japanese, and will be treated here as such. It, as all other dialects discussed, will be compared with standard Japanese.

== Pronunciation ==
:There are few major differences in pronunciation. One worth noting appears in the [[Japanese:Hougen:Tokyo|Tokyo-ben]] section.

== Intonation ==
 (no sources found yet)

== grammar constructs ==
=== negative form ===
The negative form used in the Kanto region is the one used in standard. I list it here because it is different when compared to negative forms of other areas.
* ～ない is the negative imperfect tense verb ending, and
* ～なかった is the negative perfective tense verb ending.
  example: 行かない　（いかない） will not go

=== need to... ===
Because the construct of &quot;need to&quot; is just a combination of the negative form of a verb and another word, it is really just a matter of the difference in negative forms. However, as these constructs are often contracted, it is worth noting the differences. The standard &quot;need to&quot; form looks like the following:
* ～なくては　いけない/ならない/だめ/etc...
* ～なければ　いけない/ならない/だめ/etc...
and in Kanto they are contracted, respectively, as follows:
* ～なくちゃ　いけない/ならない/だめ/etc...
* ～なきゃ　いけない/ならない/だめ/etc...

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello,

I've got a degree in electronics and have been programming as a hobby on and off for a few years. I've been designing and building small robots are a hobby for the last few years.

I've been contributing to the [[Robotics]] Wikibook for about a half year now. Started the [[Theoretical_Mechanics]] wikibook to supplement the [[Robotics]] wikibook since there wasn't a complete wikibook on this subject.

Counting the days of the month is really pretty simple — with a few exceptions. The first ten days generally follow the &quot;native Japanese&quot; counting stems. After the tenth of the month, all but the ''14th'', ''20th'' and ''24th'' follow the more basic Chinese-derived counting stems.

The first of the month is an exception, and simply must be memorized as such:
*１日　ついたち

The second through tenth of the month follow the same native Japanese counting stems as used when counting generic items ({{furi|一|ひと}}つ,　{{furi|二|ふた}}つ,　{{furi|三|みっ}}つ, {{furi|四|よっ}}つ) or people ({{furi|一|ひ}}{{furi|人|とり}}, {{furi|二|ふ}}{{furi|人|たり}}). The ending &quot;〜か&quot; is simply one of the readings for the character for &quot;日&quot;.
*２日　ふつか
*３日　みっか
*４日　よっか
*５日　いつか
*６日　むいか
*７日　なのか
*８日　ようか
*９日　ここのか
*１０日　とおか

The rest of the days of the month, generally follow the normal pattern using the counters &quot;いち&quot;, &quot;に&quot;, &quot;さん&quot;, etc., and the ending &quot;〜か&quot; is replaced with &quot;〜にち&quot;. The numbers 14 and 24 use &quot;〜よっか&quot;, not &quot;〜よんにち&quot; as one might assume from the pattern, and 20 uses &quot;はつか&quot;, not &quot;にじゅうにち&quot;.

== Periods of days ==

* &quot;前&quot; (まえ), which generally means &quot;before&quot; or &quot;in front of&quot;, is used to indicate an amount of time ago.
* &quot;〜間&quot; (かん) is used to indicate a length of time. It is usually dropped when unambiguous.

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | {{furi|３日|みっか}}{{furi|前|まえ}}に{{furi|東京|とうきょう}}に{{furi|来|き|ました}}。 || I came to Tokyo three days ago.
|-
| {{furi|冬休|ふゆやす|み}}は{{furi|１０日間|とおかかん}}です。 || Winter holidays are ten days long.
|}

When periods of time are expressed in terms of &quot;nights&quot;, the counter &quot;泊&quot; (はく) which means &quot;night&quot; or &quot;overnight&quot; in the context of staying somewhere, is affixed to the normal &quot;いち&quot;, &quot;に&quot;, &quot;さん&quot;, etc.

The same character is also used for the word &quot;泊まる&quot; (とまる) which means &quot;to stay&quot; or &quot;to stay over&quot;. As in English, this can be combined with &quot;days&quot;, which is then read as the days of the week (&quot;いっか&quot;, &quot;ふつか&quot;, &quot;みっか&quot;, &quot;よっか, etc.).

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | {{furi|旅館|りょかん}}に{{furi|２泊|にはく}}した。 || I stayed at a ryōkan (Japanese-style inn) for two nights.

      <comment>/* Second Derivative */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Often in [[Wikipedia:Physics|Physics]] or [[Wikipedia:Engineering|Engineering]] it is necessary to use a [[calculus]] operation known as [[Calculus/Differentiation|differentiation]].  Unlike textbook mathematics, the differentiated functions are data generated by an experiment or a computer code.


Begin with the [[Wikipedia:Taylor_series|Taylor series]] as seen in Equation 1.

&lt;math&gt; f(x+h) = f(x) + f^{'}(x)h + \frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!}h^{2}+\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!}h^{3}+ \cdots \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Next by cutting off the Taylor series after the fourth term and evaluating it at h and -h yields Equations (2) and (3).

&lt;math&gt; f(x+h) = f(x) + f^{'}(x)h + \frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!}h^{2} +\frac{f^{(3)}(c_{1})}{3!}h^{3} \quad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; f(x-h) = f(x) - f^{'}(x)h + \frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!}h^{2} - \frac{f^{(3)}(c_{2})}{3!}h^{3} \quad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

Then by subtracting Equation (2) by Equation (3) yields.

&lt;math&gt;f(x+h) - f(x-h) = 2f^{'}(x)h + \frac{f^{(3)}(c_{1})}{3!}h^{3} + \frac{f^{(3)}(c_{2})}{3!}h^{3}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Central Difference ===

&lt;math&gt;f^{'}(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h} + O(h^{2})&lt;/math&gt;

=== Forward Difference ===

&lt;math&gt;f^{'}(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} + O(h)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Backward Difference ===

&lt;math&gt;f^{'}(x) = \frac{f(x)-f(x-h)}{h} + O(h)&lt;/math&gt;

== Second Derivative ==

The second order derivatives can be obtained by adding equations (2) and (3) (if properly expanded to include the fourth-derivative-term):

&lt;math&gt;f^{''}(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-2f(x)+f(x-h)}{h^2} + O(h^2)&lt;/math&gt;

== High Order Derivatives ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">This module is already a bit long, but here are some more things that might be worth covering. (Perhaps accompanied by splitting the chapter!)
*Duplex (full, half, simplex)
*Baud rate detection
*RJ-45 connectors
*Using a breakout box
*Note that RS-232 uses unbalanced circuits, so twisted pair cables aren't useful
**Baluns can be used to balance the circuits for longer distance transmission
**RS-422 is similar to RS-232, but has the advantage of balanced circuits

-----------

Note that RJ-45 connectors are not standardized in regard to RS-232 protocols.  There are some devices that use them, and there are enough wires with a Cat-5 line that makes it at least in theory possible to do RS-232 over Cat-5 with RJ-45 connectors, but it is not commonly done that way.  In fact, the only &quot;standard connector&quot; specified by RS-232 is the DB-25 connector.

== Discrepancies - Possible Errors ==

* According to the [[Wikipedia:D-subminiature|D-subminiature]] article, '''DE-9''' is the correct name of the 9 pin D-shell connector. Links are now added for the D-shell connectors, but each instance of [[Wikipedia:DB-9|DB-9]] should perhaps be replaced with [[Wikipedia:DE-9|DE-9]] (possibly with a note about this common misnomer using a reference to [[Wikipedia:DB-9]].)
* RS-232 signal levels are described more precisely in [[Wikipedia:RS-232#Voltage_levels]] than in this [[Serial_Programming:RS-232_Connections#Wiring_Pins_Explained]]. The signal levels are not always +15V and -15V. Consider replacing parts of this section with a reference to [[Wikipedia:RS-232]].
* The claim that the handshake signals use negative voltage to indicate &quot;Ready&quot; contradicts my experience. The [[Wikipedia:RS-232#Voltage_levels]] descriptions about &quot;negative voltage has the functional significance of OFF&quot; and &quot;positive has the function ON&quot; also support my experience that e.g. [[Wikipedia:DTR|''Data Terminal Ready'']] is positive when the [[Wikipedia:DTE|DTE]] is ready and negative otherwise.

:: Be '''bold''' in editing this if you see factual errors.  The information I have put in comes from more technical books related to the subject rather than any &quot;hands-on&quot; experience of messing with the voltages directly on a circuit design level.  I would like to see these changes, however, be based on something concrete and formal specs.

:: The +15V and -15V signals '''are''' a part of traditional RS-232 specifications, however.  This admittedly is an older spec, and there are ranges of voltages to consider, with newer serial drivers going more toward the +/-5V range or less due to their use in embedded devices.  Still, if you were trying to hook something up to a 30 year old industrial controller using RS-232 connectors, expect the 15V line voltage, or even higher.

:: My experience when trying to purchase electronic components, parts, and cables, the suppliers understand the term DB-9.  Until you mentioned the possible term DE-9, I had honestly never even heard of it.  I guess from a purest viewpoint it should be called a DE-9 connector, and the Wikipedia article explains it pretty clearly.  Thanks for the education (although the term DB-9 should also be used in the description somewhere with brief explaination...due to suppliers not really understanding this idea either).

:: It should also be obvious that I was not using the Wikipedia content as source material for this module.  I will try and do some cleanup as well based on that source.  If you add anything from other sources, make sure that you note it on the external references area (even from dead-tree sources...include ISBN number instead).   [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 8 July 2005 18:04 (UTC)

* According to http://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/RS-232_specs.html and http://www.arcelect.com/rs232.htm the last sentence in Databits has to be changed in:&lt;BR&gt;
The least significant bit (LSB) is transmitted first in this sequence of bits to form a character.

::Thanks for the tip with the LSB/MSB change.  That was an oversight on my part, and in retrospect, it should have been obvious.  It also makes all forms of RS-232 data compatable at least on the bit level to start with, where the format of the bits is the same for all bit size transmissions except for just the number of bits actually transmitted.  A logical way to organize the protocol.  That and a simple mistake in the writing, so thanks for catching the mistake.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:07, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

== Merging ==
What is the purpose of merging this module with the almost empty module [[Serial Programming:RS-232 Technical Manual]] (less then ten sentences in the module)? Shouldn't the almost empty module better be removed and references to it replaced with references to this module?

:As the original author of this module, I strongly disagree with the premise that this module should be abandoned in favor of another Wikibook.  There is a purpose and goal that I have in mind, particularly that I've put into the [[Serial Programming:Introduction and OSI Model|introduction to this Wikibook]].  This is a multi-chapter book about serial data programming, which the RS-232 Technical Manual is really a totally seperate item.  This is not Wikipedia where you can have one and only one article about a particular subject.  IMHO, a separate Wikibook that goes into even more depth would be useful, although one I'm not willing to write at the moment.

:This other Wikibook started as a part of an editorial conflict me regarding the direction of this Wikibook about serial programming.  I am not making a Wikiproject that points to serial programming references, but instead I'm trying to write a book.  This distinction is somehow lost on some people, and don't understand the differences between Wikibooks and Wikipedia.  As a book, I am trying to go into detail about a subject, and build on that knowledge in subsequent chapters.  This is not an easy thing to do, although I am grateful for all of the assistance that has been rendered so far to improve these chapters I've already written.

:In short, I don't see why the two Wikibooks can't be made for this subject.  The Technical Manual is to be more of a reference guide, and this Wikibook is to be an introduction to the subject.  In short, I am trying to teach ''about'' serial programming, and it is my intention to turn this into a textbook.  Those are two very different goals and need to be written very differently.  That they may have some similar content is besides the point.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:00, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

== Where is it? (Hardware flow control description) ==

'''This is a part of the &quot;Hardware&quot; flow control protocol that will be explained below'''

At least the checked URL ?
Two URL's below tells opposite voltage's meaning &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;go&quot;.

http://www.camiresearch.com/Data_Com_Basics/RS232_standard.html

http://www.taltech.com/TALtech_web/resources/intro-sc.html#Synch

PS: This seems to claim 0=go, 1=stop also, but it is not said frankly:  http://www.hw-server.com/rs232_signals.html#t6

:I guess I need to simply pull out an oscilloscope and find out for myself with a difinitive answer from the real world.  I would venture to bet that both + voltage and - voltage being asserted as a logical &quot;1&quot; does occur.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:55, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When using numerical methods or algorithms and computing with finite precision, errors of approximation or rounding and truncation are introduced. It is important to have a notion of their nature and their order. A newly developed method is worthless without an error analysis. Neither does it make sense to use methods which introduce errors with magnitudes larger than the effects to be measured or simulated. On the other hand, using a method with very high accuracy might be computationally too expensive to justify the gain in accuracy.

== Accuracy and Precision ==

Measurements and calculations can be characterized with regard to their accuracy and precision. Accuracy refers to how closely a value agrees with the true value.  Precision refers to how closely values agree with each other. The following figures illustrate the difference between accuracy and precision.  In the first figure, the given values (black dots) are more accurate; whereas in the second figure, the given values are more precise.  The term ''error'' represents the imprecision and inaccuracy of a numerical computation.

[[File:Accuracy of given values.png|thumb|300px|left|Accuracy]]
[[File:Precision of given values.png|thumb|300px|right|Precision]]

==Absolute Error==
Absolute Error is the magnitude of the difference between the true value x and the approximate value xa, Therefore absolute error=[x-xa] 
The error between two values is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{abs}= \left \| \tilde{x} - x \right \| \quad , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; denotes the exact value and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}&lt;/math&gt; its approximation.

==Relative Error==

The relative error of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute error relative to the exact value. Look at it this way: if your measurement has an error of  &amp;plusmn; 1 inch, this seems to be a huge error when you try to measure something which is 3 in. long. However, when measuring distances on the order of miles, this error is mostly negligible. The definition of the relative error is

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_{rel} = \frac{\left \| \tilde{x} - x \right \|}{\left \| x \right \|} \quad . &lt;/math&gt;

==Sources of Error==
In a numerical computation, error may arise because of the following reasons:
* Truncation error

* Roundoff error

===Truncation Error===
Truncation error refers to the error in a method, which occurs because some series (finite or infinite) is truncated to a fewer number of terms. Such errors are essentially algorithmic errors and we can predict the extent of the error that will occur in the method.

===Roundoff Error===
Roundoff error occurs because of the computing device's inability to deal with certain numbers. Such numbers need to be rounded off to some near approximation which is dependent on the word size used to represent numbers of the device.

Tetum is one of the two official languages of East Timor ''(Timor L'este)'', the other one being Portuguese. It is worth noting that a significant number of people also speak Indonesian, English, Cantonese, or one the other 15 indigenous languages.

For several centuries, East Timor was a Portuguese colony, because of that fact Tetum gained many similarities to that language. Eventually, East Timor was annexed by Indonesia. After a protracted fight for independence, the people was allowed to chose via a referendum. Independence was finally gained and East Timor became the first democracy of the new millennium.

Durante vários séculos, Timor Leste foi uma colónia portuguesa, por esse motivo, o Tétum adquiriu varias similaridades com essa língua. Por último, o Timor Leste foi anexado pela Indonésia. Após uma prolongada luta pela independência, foi permitido ao povo fazer a sua escolha por via de um referendo. A independência foi finalmente ganha e Timor Leste tornou-se na primeira democracia do novo milenário.

[[/Introduction|'''Introduction''' - Ancient Egypt]]

&lt;/big&gt;

The fifth century BC historian Herodotus called Egypt &quot;the gift of the Nile,&quot; meaning that the country would not exist without its river.  Surrounded to east and west by inhospitable desert, and to the south by rough and rocky badlands and high country, Egypt was long an isolated country that gave rise to a unique kingdom in ancient times.

| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Geography|'''Chapter 1''' - Geography]]

&lt;/big&gt;

The Nile is the principal feature of Egyptian geography, which made it in ancient times a nation rarely more than twelve miles wide from east to west — but more than 600 miles long from north to south.  However, the black land of Egypt, and the mineral wealth of the surrounding deserts, made Egypt prosperous and mighty from its earliest days up to the days of the Roman empire.

| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt|'''Chapter 2''' - Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt]]

&lt;/big&gt;

Egypt, like all nations, did not emerge full-grown onto the world stage.  Archaeological investigations have demonstrated that several cultures emerged and thrived on the banks of the Nile River, before two kingdoms managed to take hold of the land, and eventually unite under a single royal standard.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[Image:25%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Old Kingdom|'''Chapter 3''' - The Old Kingdom]]

&lt;/big&gt;

Once Egypt was united under a single monarch, a period of great order and stability began, which was to last for almost a thousand years.  Protected from outside forces by impassible desert, and immune to change because of the orderly, predictable nature of life in ancient Egypt, the first dynasties were able to erect the pyramids as monuments to their god-kings.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Middle Kingdom|'''Chapter 4''' - The Middle Kingdom]]

&lt;/big&gt;

Drought, famine, and the rise of an aristocracy helped bring about the end of the Old Kingdom and usher in a period of new prosperity, in which nobles and ordinary citizens began to share in Egypt's wealth.  The appearance of foreign invaders, the Hyksos, also changed and renewed Egyptian culture.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/New Kingdom|'''Chapter 5''' - The New Kingdom]]

&lt;/big&gt;

The resurgence of Egyptian power after the pharaohs of the 18th  Dynasty drove out the Hyksos led to Egyptian imperialism and major building programs that proclaimed the might of the pharaohs, and the gods who watched over them.  However, new ideas in religion and political changes in the wider world tended to limit Egyptian power in unexpected ways.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Late Period and Ptolemaic Egypt|'''Chapter 6''' - Late Period and Ptolemaic Egypt]]

&lt;/big&gt;

Successive waves of invasion — by Kushites, Assyrians, Persians, and Greeks — made Egypt a land of outward looking leadership and inward-looking commoners, and widened the divide between governors and governed.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Roman and Byzantine Egypt|'''Chapter 7''' - Roman and Byzantine Egypt]]

&lt;/big&gt;

Egypt became the breadbasket of two successive empires, but the very nature of its wealth — in agriculture and critical products — made it a tempting target to Persian and Islamized Arab alike.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Decline|'''Chapter 8''' - Decline]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''insert summary here''

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Egyptology|'''Chapter 9''' - Egyptology]]

&lt;/big&gt;

Waves of visitors from Europe brought a madness for things Egyptian back to the salons and coffeehouses of Europe.  Italian tourists made off with the corpse of St. Mark for Venice; British forces stole the Rosetta Stone from Napoleon, who stole it from the wall of a peasant hut; and Howard Carter wasted a British lord's money for years before finding the only unlooted tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Pyramids|'''Chapter 10''' - Pyramids]]

&lt;/big&gt;

They rank as some of the largest human-built structures on the planet, and yet their 'only' function seems to be as tombs for rulers of the second, third and fourth dynasties of Egypt during the Old Kingdom.  What are they, and how were they built?

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Pharaohs|'''Chapter 11''' - Pharaohs]]

&lt;/big&gt;

Gods, kings, ordinary men, a few women, and strangely inter-related... the pharaohs of Egypt have probably had more prestige and mystery than any other rulers in world history.  Who were they, and what did they do?

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Tutmask.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[/Culture|'''Chapter 12''' - Culture]]

&lt;/big&gt;

Egypt is a land of huge statues, deep tombs, and a confusing, contradictory culture.  Their obsession with the afterlife winds up explaining an enormous amount to us today about how they lived, worked and played.

[[../Rome/Introduction|'''Introduction''' - Ancient Rome]]

&lt;/big&gt;

The Roman civilization achieved greatness through a culture that borrowed, begged and stole the best elements of many other societies, while welding them together with a common legal and military structure.  Arguments about the parallels between ancient Rome and modern society arise regularly; hence the study of ancient Rome may prove instructive.

| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[../Rome/Etruscans|'''Chapter 1''' - The Etruscans]] &lt;small&gt;2000-800 BCE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

The Etruscans lived in the region of modern Tuscany in Italy.  In contact with both Phoenicians and Greeks, they developed an interesting culture that made several important contributions to the Latin society in which Rome appeared.
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]

| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[../Rome/Origins|'''Chapter 2''' - Origins of Rome]] &lt;small&gt;800-500 BCE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

Beginning as a collection of villages near an important river crossing, Rome became a united city-state eager to dominate its neighbors as part of a strategy for security and prosperity.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[Image:25%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[../Rome/Republic|'''Chapter 3''' - The Roman Republic]] &lt;small&gt;600-350 BCE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

After throwing out the Etruscan royal family, a group of prominent families established a new constitution — one which enabled the new state to assume a leading role in the affairs of the Italian peninsula.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[../Rome/Expansion|'''Chapter 4''' - Expansion]] &lt;small&gt;350-290 BCE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

Between 509 BC and 394 BC, Rome came to dominate the Italian peninsula, and began to assume important diplomatic and military functions in the wider Mediterranean world.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[../Rome/PunicWars|'''Chapter 5''' - The Punic Wars]] &lt;small&gt;264-146 BCE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

Between 264 and 146 BC, the Romans fought three wars with their great rivals, the Carthaginians.  These two early superpowers had different cultural values, different military strengths, and different political aims.  Both states sought to rule the Mediterranean, and neither could accept the others' survival.

&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[../Rome/Crisis|'''Chapter 6''' - Republic to Empire]]&lt;small&gt;146 BCE - 27 CE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

Now unchallenged in the Mediterranean, Rome found domestic disputes among the great men, great families and great classes of society to be the ruling force in her politics.  These disputes broke out of the Curia and into a series of open civil wars, which led to the collapse of the Republic and the rise of the Empire.
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[../Rome/Empire 1|'''Chapter 7''' - The Early Empire]] &lt;small&gt;27 CE - 305 CE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

The new political model of the Empire demonstrated its value rapidly.  The Emperors maintained control of the city only haphazardly, while the provinces remained relatively stable.  As the Empire grew, the problems of succession and leadership kept recurring, and Diocletian decided to find some other solution.  His failures led to a new era in Roman society.
| style=&quot;background:#CCCCEE;vertical-align:top&quot; | [[Image:Example.jpg|60px|caption]]
|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top;text-align:center&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-top:10px&quot;&gt;[[File:00%.svg]]&lt;/div&gt;
| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[../Rome/Empire 2|'''Chapter 8''' - The Later Empire]] &lt;small&gt;305 CE - 450 CE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

Now the Emperors had to contend with a new religion as well as resurgent enemies on the frontiers.  Christianity had made great gains in the previous three centuries, and now the Romans had to embrace a formerly-persecuted faith.  At the same time, political and economic changes on the fringes of the Empire, and growing weaknesses within were pushing the Empire toward collapse.

| style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot; | &lt;div style=&quot;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

[[../Rome/Collapse|'''Chapter 9''' - The Fall of Rome]]&lt;small&gt;400 CE - 600 CE&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;

Many theories abound explaining why Rome fell: barbarian invasions, dried-up trade, economic failures, hard currency fleeing the country, lead in the water, adoption of the Christian faith, and failure to adopt Christian values completely. In this section we look at some of the reasons for Rome's collapse, and examine some of the reasons why it continued to exert a strong hold on the Western imagination.

'''Introduction''' - Mesopotamia

&lt;/big&gt;

''Mesopotamia is an ancient Greek word meaning &quot;land between the rivers&quot;.  Between 5000 BCE and 500 BCE, it was home to successive waves of cultures, borrowing and cooperating with one another for resources, ideas and culture, as well as competing with one another militarily for land and prestige.''

'''Section 2''' - First Civilizations

&lt;/big&gt;

''Near the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers on the Persian Gulf is a marshy, low-lying region that in ancient times was the home of the first cities — the land of Sumer.  Here, the city-states of Ur, Uruk and others competed for land, power, and prestige while trying to fend off barbarians.  These cities became the ancient Greece of the region — providing written language, architecture, religion, and cultural norms to the societies that followed.''

'''Section 3''' - The Amorites and Babylon

&lt;/big&gt;

''Babylon was the first city-state to assemble a true kingdom around itself in Mesopotamia.  Located at a point not far from modern-day Baghdad, the Babylonians used the river for communication and control in a wide empire that spread across the river valleys.''

'''Section 4''' - Upper Mesopotamia

&lt;/big&gt;

''Assyria was named after its first capital, Assur, and referred to an area of Northern Mesopotamia, as opposed to the Southern Mesopotamia of Sumer, Akkad and Babylonia.''

'''Section 5''' - [[/Neo-Assyrian Empire|The Neo-Assyrian Empire]]

&lt;/big&gt;

''Assyria believed in military domination of its enemies.  The kings of Assyria conquered lands from the Hittites, Egyptians, and Medes, as well as all the minor kingdoms between.  They rate negative attention in sources as widely spread as the Bible and Hittite archives for their cruelty and villainy.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gustar only uses the third person singular and plural forms, along with a direct object pronoun: me, te, le, nos, os, les. For example:

Me gusta el perro. ''I like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Me gustan los perros. ''I like the dogs.''&lt;br&gt;
Te gusta el perro. ''You like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Te gustan los perros. ''You like the dogs.''&lt;br&gt;
Le gusta el perro. ''She like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Le gustan los perros. ''She like the dogs.''&lt;br&gt;


Nos gusta el perro. ''We like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Nos gustan los perros. ''We like the dogs.''&lt;br&gt;
Vos gusta el perro. ''You like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Vos gustan los perros. ''You like the dogs.''&lt;br&gt;
Les gusta el perro. ''They like the dog.''&lt;br&gt;
Les gustan los perros. ''They like the dogs.''


There are several verbs like this, such as encantar, fascinar, importar, chocar, and flipar, and are referred to as ''gustar-type verbs''

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure how detailed this book is going to be in general, but it seems like color should probably be discussed beyond the level of  fundamental color theory.  I'd be interested in seeing a very very basic introduction to what color is (light-wise) and a brief discussion of psychological function and even basic interaction (like complimentary colors).  Much beyond fundamental color theory, though, and it might make more sense to put it into different sections.  --[[User:Mstults|Matt S]] 08:45, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)


==EFL?==
Hi, I got to this article from the Teaching English as a Foreign Language Lesson plan article under the &quot;Beginner&quot; heading. I feel like it may be misplaced as the content of this article doesn't seem to address the teaching of English at all! I'm not sure how to change it, hopefully this will be brought to the attention of the proper authorities. [[User:Telor|Telor]] ([[User talk:Telor|talk]]) 08:51, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

== Wikibook rename proposal ==
I'm putting up the proposal to rename this book from Colors to &quot;Color Theory&quot;. Colors seems too generic and abrangent to properly describe what is/should be covered. If anyone has a better title please put it forward...   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:23, 5 February 2011 (UTC)

I agree.

== About this wikibook ==
This page is a stub of what pretends to be a future module dealing with the rules governing the Grammar according to Transformational theories. We may also add the new theories of the Minimalist Program.

As long as this module is a stub, I would prefer to keep it under my user page. But I encourage you to modify, contribute and discuss whatever you consider necessary. And if you want to contribute but you don't like the book to be under my user-page, we may consider moving it.

I am a Spanish native speaker, but I have studied this theory applied only to English language. I'd like to study the transformational principles applied to Spanish language, and then, I'd begin a Spanish wikibook about this topic. 

I'd be very grateful to those English speaking wikicontributors who may check my mistakes. Thank you :)

=== The problem of the branching representation ===
I just discovered that we can use branching nodes to represent the examples, have a look [http://wikisophia.org/wiki/Wikitex here], we may also use the box '''[  ]''' symbology and/or pictures created by us and uploaded to Commons.

== Contents ==

=== What is the transformational grammar? ===

The transformational grammar is a mathematically powerful grammar based on the theory of language described by [[w:Noam Chomsky]]. More information in [[w:Transformational grammar]].

=== Categorial information ===
The syntactic category of a word determines its distribution in the syntactic structure.

==== Word level categories ====
A adjective

ADV adverb

D determiner

N noun

P preposition

V verb

==== Phrasal level categories ====
AP adjectival phrase

(ADVP adverbial phrase) Its existence is discussed.

DP determiner phrase (According to Santorini and Kroch)

NP noun phrase

PP prepositional phrase

VP verbal phrase

IP inflectional phrase

CP complementizer phrase

=== Constituency tests ===
*Preposing: only phrasal constituents may undergo preposing.

 1.a.*People at Wikimedia Embassy we have a list with.
   b. At meta:Wikimedia Embassy we have a list with people. (''Example taken from [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Volunteers_wanted:_Wikimedia_Embassy])

Constituency vs. adjunct tests


=== Phrase markers ===
*Hierarchic structure

In the transformational grammar, it is proposed that the constituents of a clause are hierarchically structured. 

*Branch
*Node and branching node

The node is the point where two (or more) branches are connected.

*Dominance
*Exhaustive dominance
*Immediate dominance
*Precedence
*Immediately precedence
*'''C-command''': (see also coindexing) 
:A c-command B iff (if and only if) the node that immediately dominates A also dominates B and neither A dominates B, nor B dominates A.
*
=== Phrase structure rules ===
''(More information about this topic in Wikipedia's article [[w:Phrase_structure_rules]])
 '''XP''' → (W) '''X(')''' (Y)


==== Phrase structure in a NP ====

*Determiner rule:

 N&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;→ D N' (According to Radford (2003))

*Adjunct rule:

 N'→ N' PP

*Complement rule

 N' → N PP

=== Argument structure and Theta-role ===
The arguments are participants selected by the predicate. Each argument receives a theta role assigned by the predicate and, each theta role needs to be assigned to one and only one argument.


==== Theta or semantic roles ====

#Theme
#Agent 
#Cause 
#Locative
#Source 
#Goal
#Experiencer
#Benefactive
#Instrument
#Manner
#Reason
#Time

=== X' theory ===
(Initially extracted from [[w:X-bar theory|X-bar theory]]).

'''X-bar theory''' is a component of [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory which attempts to identify syntactic features common to all languages. The theory claims that there are certain structural similarities among all phrasal categories of all languages. The letter X is used to signify an arbitrary lexical category for  the [[w:head (linguistics)|head]] of the phrase (instead of, for example, N for [[w:noun|noun]] or V for [[w:verb|verb]]) in order to allow a generic description.

X-bar theory adds additional levels of hierarchy to more traditional [[w:phrase structure rules|phrase structure rules]] using the phrasal constituent called an X-bar. 

The head, X, is said to combine with a [[w:complement|complement]] to form an X-bar, and an [[w:adjunct]] is said to combine with an X-bar to form another X-bar. Finally, an X-bar is said to combine with a [[w:specifier|specifier]] to form the top level of the phrase, the X Phrase (or XP). [In this way, complements are distinguished from adjuncts by the fact that a complement has an X as a sister, whereas an adjunct has X-bar as a sister.]

These rules can be formalized as follows:
* XP --&gt; (specifier), X-bar '' An X Phrase consists of an optional specifier and an X-bar, in either order.''
* (X-bar --&gt; X-bar, adjunct) '' An X-bar may consist of an X-bar and an adjunct, in either order.''
* X-bar --&gt; X, (complement...) '' An X-bar consists of an X and any number of complements, in either order.''

Note, the adjuct rule is itself optional.

=== Subcategorization frame ===
The subcategorization frame shows the constituents selected or subcategorized by a lexical item. The number of constituents subcategorized depends on the valency of the lexical item. For example, the verb &quot;give&quot; is trivalent (or three place predicate). Thus, it is associated with three arguments.

 The three Wise Men give many presents to the children.
 The three Wise Men give the children many presents.

 give: [___ NP PP(to)]
       [___ NP NP] (see Dative shift)


=== Selectional restrictions ===
Predicates impose certain semantic restrictions to the arguments selected. For example, in 1. the predicate &quot;overtake&quot; may select the NP &quot;a cyclist&quot; as an argument, but it cannot select the NP &quot;a smile&quot; :

 1. a. The car driver overtook a cyclist.
    b.*The car driver overtook a smile.

=== Transformations ===

*Structure-Preserving Hypothesis

The transformations are structure-preserving. Thus, when a constituent moves to a new position, the constituent must keep the same category as it was.

==== Deep and Surface structure ====


==== NP raising ====
The NP raises to SpecIP position to cover subject requirements and to obtain a compatible case.

==== V-I or I-V movement ====

There are two significant and different hypotheses used to explain the process of inflectional affixation in English verbs. While Chomsky suggested that the inflectional element lowers to V position, also called '''affix lowering''', others have suggested that the V rises to I position.


===== NICE properties =====
NICE is an acronym used to distinguish the main verbs from the auxiliary and modal verbs.

*'''N'''egation 
 [IP I''(i)'' do [NEGP not [VP ''t(i)'' scream]]].
(Do support in order to fulfill the VI movement requirement when lexical, because lexical verb ''scream'' cannot undergo VI movement).
 *[IP I''(i)'' scream''(j)'' [NEGP not [VP ''t(i)'' ''t(j)'']]].
The ungrammaticality of this example shows that lexical verbs cannot undergo V-I movement and they need do-support, as it is shown in the previous grammatical example.

*'''I'''nversion (in interrogative sentence formation). 
 [CP Do''(i)''[IP you''(j)''  ''t(i)''[VP''t(j)'' scream]]]?
(I-C movement)

*'''C'''
*'''E'''llipsis

Only verbs in the inflectional domain may undergo these properties. That is why we cannot apply them to lexical verbs, because the lexical verbs stay always in the lexical domain. When a V-I movement is needed, then it undergoes do insertion.

==== I-C movement ====
I-C, Inflectional to Complementizer domain movement takes place in:
*Semiindirect speech
*Direct questions (see the example above in Inversion, of NICE properties).
*Subordinate clauses.

=== Functional domain ===

==== Inflectional phrase (IP) ====

*Modal verbs and auxiliary verbs.
Modal verbs are generated in the functional domain, as it is proved in the next examples:

:*Negation: (the particle of negation, in English, may only occur between the IP and the VP.

 1  a. The wikipedians should not despise other users.
    b.*The wikipedians not should despise other users.
:*Sentential adverbs: (sentential adverbs are those adverbs which, according to Radford, are immediately dominated by the Sentence node.

 2  a. [IP The wikipedians(i) necessarily should [VP (i) respect other users]].
    b. *[IP The wikipedians(i) should [VP (i) respect necessarily other users]].

Modal verbs may co-occur in the same clause with one or more auxiliary verbs:

 3  a. The wikipedians should have respected other users.
    b. The wikipedians should have been respected by other users.

However, modal verbs may not co-occur in the same clause with other modal verbs, as it is shown in an ungrammatical sentence like:

 4  *The wikipedians must should respect other users.

=== Complementizer domain ===

==== Wh- movement ====

*Wh- base generation

 1 a. [CP What(''h'') do(''i'') [IP you(''j'') ''t(i)''[VP ''t(j)'' like ____(what)''t(k)''?]]]
                                         

*Complex NP constraint.
The Complex NP is a Noun Phrases whose head is modified by a relative clause or by a Noun Complement Clause. Wh- movement out of a Complex NP leads to ungrammaticality, because there is no way to extract an element out of a Complex NP. That is the reason why Complex NPs are called islands.

*Wh-island constraint
In the same way, no constituent can undergo extraction from a subordinate clause whose CP  by a WH- word.


*Head Movement constraint
*Adjacency and the Boundary theory

=== Glosary of terms ===

*A adverb
*AP adverbial phrase
*Complement-adjunct tests.
*Constituency rules.
*Constituency tests.
*DP Determiner phrase
*NP Noun phrase
*PP Prepositional phrase
*VP Verbal phrase

'''Apple Bundt Cake''' - This very easy to make cake requires no fancy frosting or filling and is delicious for serving at breakfast, tea time or even as a birthday cake with a chocolate or fruit glaze covering.

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*Rind of 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*½ tsp [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]]
*½ tsp [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*2 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*2 tsp [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*3 large tart [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]]s, grated
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisin]]s

Serves 12

==Procedure==
#Mix quickly in the food processor the sugar and lemon rind.
#Add eggs and blend until it becomes a nice cream.
#Continue blending while slowly adding the oil.
#Blend until well mixed and add vanilla.
#In a separate bowl sift the dry ingredients all together (flour, allspice, nutmeg, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon).
#Mix the dry ingredients slowly into the batter blending until it becomes a nice thick cream.
#Add grated apples and blend quickly into batter just to mix. Be sure not to overblend and shred the apples too much.
#Add raisins and pulse the processor as to just mix them in and not shred them.
#Bake for 55 minutes at approximately [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|320°F (160°C)]] or until sticking a knife into center comes out clean.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Use Set Notation?==
Let's have a discussion about just using set notation for big-O. I think instead of saying that
:&lt;math&gt;O(n\lg n)\le O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) = O(g(n))&lt;/math&gt;
We should use the set notation only:
:&lt;math&gt;O(n\lg n)\subset O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;f(n)\in O(g(n))&lt;/math&gt;
We could still define what the &quot;=&quot;s notation means, and mention that it's also used. But it would be nice to avoid these notational issues and follow the &quot;newer&quot; trend and adopt the set notation. We still would say &quot;T(n) is O(n)&quot; instead of &quot;T(n) is in O(n)&quot;, because &quot;is&quot; in English is commonly understood to be in only one direction, not both.
--[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:39, 1 Jan 2005 (UTC)

''Introduction to Algorithms'' by Thomas Cormen, et. al. (ISBN 0-262-03293-7) explains its use of = by pointing out that sometimes we will want to say &lt;math&gt;3n^2+2n-17 = 3n^2+\Theta(n)&lt;/math&gt; or even &lt;math&gt;3n^2+\Theta(n) = \Theta(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;, which don't work if we just replace = with &amp;isin;. So it's probably better to keep = and just explain what it means.

:Good point, we shouldn't get too far off the beaten path. We could leave the set interpretation as just a side note. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:16, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Anyway, in order to understand any of this, readers need a basic understanding of set theory, or at least its notation. [[Discrete_mathematics/Set_theory]], [[Wikipedia:Naive set theory]], and [[Wikipedia:Set]] all have basic summaries of the needed notation which could be copied here. I like [[Wikipedia:Naive set theory]]'s best. Was there any resolution to the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Approach_to_Mathematics_Wikibooks]]?
--[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 01:36, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Hey Jyasskin: BTW, Thanks for your contributions. There was no resolution with how to handle Mathematics books (and the like). For this book I'd like to see it be as self-contained as possible (it assumes the sister book on Data Structures, however it doesn't assume all of Data Structure book's content either). I think it would be safe to assume some knowledge of descrete math, but we wouldn't want to demonstrate, say, the continuum hypothesis.
:Also, we'd probably want to use more examples than the wikipedia. For example, defining some natural sets along with the notation right away just so the material won't seem so abstract. A section on Set Theory right after the Mathematical Definitions sounds good. (Or perhaps you might like set theory first, to introduce relations too, which the Mathematical Definitions section uses). [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:16, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Little-o vs. Small-o ==

I always called what you call &quot;small-o&quot; &quot;little-o.&quot;

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Little-oNotation.html
:That makes sense. Thanks. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:50, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

== Undefined Logical Negation symbol under types of relations ==

In describing the different types of relations, the logical negation symbol is used, for instance in defining irreflexive. However nowhere before that point or around it a suitable interpretation of that symbol is provided. Besides the interpretation is going to depend on the particular relation being defined and its set. --[[User: Balbir Thomas|Balbir Thomas]] 17:00, 21 January 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the wiki-world of Policy Debate! Whether you are a novice, varsity debater, or college hot shot, this book can hopefully be of use.  One of the most exciting things about debate is the initial socialization process of the activity. Learning the open-ended rules, the debate jargon, and how to spin your pen around your thumb!  Although we can't learn everything online, this repository is the perfect place for an introduction to debate, basic debate theory, and advice about debate.  And, heck, because of the limitless and easily maintainable Wiki format, it can eventually expand into argument lists, citelists, and more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Co-ordinates are a way of describing position. In two dimensions, positions are given in two perpendicular directions, ''x'' and ''y''.

==Linear Equations==

===Straight lines===
A straight line has a fixed gradient. The gradient of a line and its y intercept are the two pieces of information that distinguish one line from another line.

===Equations of a straight line===
The most common form of a straight line is y = mx + c. m is the gradient of the line, and c is the point at which the line intercepts the y-axis. When c is 0, the line passes through the origin (0,0).
Other forms of the equation are x = a, used for vertical lines of an infinite gradient and y = b is used for horizontal lines with a zero gradient. Also some equations are commonly written as:  px + qy + c = 0. 
You can also use the equation y-y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=m(x-x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

===Gradient of a line===
The steepness of a line can be measured by its gradient, which is the change in the y direction divided by the change in the x direction. The letter m is used to denote the gradient. The formula to find a gradient is: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}&lt;/math&gt;  
As a side note &lt;math&gt;\tan\theta = m\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Point-Gradient Form===
The equation of a line having the co-ordinate &lt;math&gt;\left(x_1,y_1\right)&lt;/math&gt; and having a gradient of m is: &lt;math&gt;y-y_1=m\left(x - x_1\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Then you simply rearrange the equation into the form y = mx + c.

===Parallel lines===
A pair of lines are parallel (the symbol is &lt;math&gt;\|&lt;/math&gt; ). If their gradients are equal, &lt;math&gt;m_1 = m_2\,&lt;/math&gt;.  So in order to find  the equation of a parallel line you need the slope of the original line and one set of co-ordinates on the parallel line. Then you use the Point-Gradient formula to find the equation of the parallel line.

===Perpendicular lines===
A pair of lines are perpendicular (the symbol is &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;) if the product of their gradients is &lt;math&gt;m_1 \times m_2=-1&lt;/math&gt;, . So if you need the equation of a line perpendicular to another line, all you need to do is replace the gradient m with the negative reciprocal of m.

So for example if line 1 is y = 2x +3 and you need to find the line perpendicular to this that goes through the point (0,1), then the gradient m = -1/2 (because 2 x -1/2 = -1).
 
This gives y = -x/2 +c. 

Putting the known point (0,1) into this equation gives :

1= -0/2 +c which gives c = 1

so the equation is y = 1- x/2.

===Distance between two points===
Using the co-ordinates of two points, it is possible to calculate the distance between them using Pythagoras' theorem.
The distance d between any two points &lt;math&gt;A(x_1,y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B(x_2,y_2)&lt;/math&gt; is given by: 
&lt;math&gt;d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Mid-point of a line===

When the co-ordinate of two points are known, the mid-point is the point halfway between those two points. For any two points A&lt;math&gt;({x_1},{y_1})&lt;/math&gt; and B&lt;math&gt;({x_2},{y_2})&lt;/math&gt;, the co-ordinates of the mid-point of AB can be found by &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac {{x_1} + {x_2}}{2}, \frac {{y_1} + {y_2}}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Intersection of lines===

Any two straight lines will meet at a point, as long as they are not parallel. You can find the point of intersection simply by solving the two [[../Equations#Simultaneous_equations|equations simultaneously]]. This is also true for curves, although non linear curves may intersect at multiple points or not at all and usually require different methods to solve.

==Curves==

To sketch a graph of a curve, all you need to know is the general shape of the curve and other important pieces of information such as the x and y intercepts and the points of any maxima and minima.

===Curves in the form &lt;math&gt;y=x^n&lt;/math&gt;===
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
|[[Image:Y%3D2.svg|400px]] || [[Image:Y%3DX.svg|400px]]
|-
|Degree 0 - Constant - &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. In this case y=2 || Degree 1 - Linear - &lt;math&gt;ax + b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;mx + c&lt;/math&gt;. In this case y = x.
|-
| [[Image:Y%3DX%5E2.svg|400px]] ||[[Image:Y%3DX%5E3.svg|400px]]
|-
|Degree 2 - Quadratic - &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt; . In this case y = &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; || Degree 3 - Cubic - &lt;math&gt;ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d&lt;/math&gt;. In this case y = &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}
Note: That all the odd powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; share the same general shape, moving from bottom-left to top-right, and that all the even powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; share the same &quot;bucket&quot; shaped curve.

===Curves in the form &lt;math&gt;y=\frac {1} {x^n}&lt;/math&gt;===

Just like earlier, curves with an even powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; all have the same general shape, and those with odd powers of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; share another general shape.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
|[[Image:Y%3D1x.svg|400px]] || [[Image:Y%3D1x%5E2.svg|400px]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| [[Image:Y%3D1x%5E3.svg|400px]] ||[[Image:Y%3D1x%5E4.svg|400px]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{x^3}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{x^4}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

All curves in this form do not have a value for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {0}&lt;/math&gt; is undefined. There are '''asymptotes''' on the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis, where the curve moves towards the y axis increasingly slowly but will never actually touch.

===Curves in the form &lt;math&gt;y=\sqrt x&lt;/math&gt;===
[[Image:Sqrt(x).svg]]&lt;p&gt;
All curves in this form will not have values for x &lt; 0. They will all have the same general shape.

===Intersection of lines and curves===

When a line intersects with a curve, it is possible to find the points of intersection by substituting the equation of the line into the equation of the curve. If the line is in the form &lt;math&gt;y = mx + c&lt;/math&gt;, then you can replace any instances of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;mx + c&lt;/math&gt;, and then expand the equation out and then [[../Equations|factorise]] the resulting quadratic.

===Intersection of curves===

The same method can be used as for a line and a curve. However, it will only work in simple cases. When an algebraic method fails, you will need to resort to a graphical or [[A-level Mathematics/OCR/C3/Numerical Methods|Numerical Method]]. In the exam, you will only be required to use algebraic methods.

===Graphical Rules===
In many cases it is easy to obtain a graph from a prexisting graph using these rules.
====Reflection====
# &lt;math&gt;y = -f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a reflection of &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; through the x axis.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (-x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a reflection of &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; through the y axis.

====Stretching====
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (bx \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is stretched away from the y-axis if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; b &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt; and stretched towards the y-axis if &lt;math&gt;b &gt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;. In both cases the change is by b units.
# &lt;math&gt;y = af \left (x \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is stretched towards the x-axis if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; a &lt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt; and stretched away from the x-axis if &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 1\,&lt;/math&gt;. In both cases the change is by a units.

====Translations====
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x - h \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by h units to the right.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x + h \right )\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by h units to the left.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right ) + k\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by k units upwards.
# &lt;math&gt;y = f \left (x \right ) - k\,&lt;/math&gt; is a translation of f(x) by k units downwards.

==The Circle==
A circle is a set of all points in a plane that are a fixed distance r away from a given point called the center. The distance r is the radius of a circle.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:CircleAnnotated.png]]&lt;p&gt;
The two basic laws of circles are:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Area = \pi r^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Circumference = 2 \pi r\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties of a circle===
A radius always bisects a chord if they are perpendicular to each other.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:RadiusandCord.png]]&lt;p&gt;
If any point on the circumference of the circle is connected to the diameter, it forms a right angled triangle.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:CircleRightTriangle.png]]&lt;p&gt;
If a radius is drawn and then a tangent is drawn from that point. Then the radius and tangent line will be perpendicular to each other.&lt;p&gt;
[[Image:RadiusTangent.png]]&lt;p&gt;

===Equation of a Circle===
The standard equation of a circle is:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = r^2\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This will always give us a circle centered around the origin (0,0). If we want a circle with a center at (h,k) we use the following formula.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left (x - h \right )^2 + \left (y - k \right )^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However you can not graph either of these equations with a calculator. You will need to split it into two equations, but the graph will not be perfect, because x is undefined when x = 0 and when &lt;math&gt;(x -h)^2 = r^2&lt;/math&gt;: 
&lt;math&gt;y =+ \sqrt{r^2 - \left ( x - h \right )^2} + k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y =- \sqrt{r^2 - \left ( x - h \right )^2} + k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Here is how &lt;math&gt;\left (x - 5 \right )^2 + \left (y - 8 \right )^2 = 2^2&lt;/math&gt; would look graphed:&lt;p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">PHPEclipse is a set of plugins for the [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse Framework] which provide and integrated IDE for [http://www.php.net/ PHP] developers. Eclipse, and PHPEclipse are written in Java, and will run on all graphical desktop environments. PHPEclipse is Open Source software, freely available under the [http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html Common Public Licence].

==Why Use PHPEclipse?==

There are several decent Integrated Development Environments available for PHP web development, each with their own pros and cons. So what stands out about PHPEclipse?

'''Eclipse is a Consistent and Mature Platform'''

The Eclipse Platform provides users with a consistent user interface paradigm. A software development IDE is one of the more complex desktop applications most of us are likely to use, and so the time required for a developer to become efficient with a particular IDE can be significant. Eclipse doesn't reduce this time, but it does provide a consistent interface approach which need only be learnt once in order to develop efficiently with a wide range of programming languages and tools. As part of this approach, Eclipse provides detailed documentation and tutorials on all it's generic functionality, allowing plugin projects, such as PHPEclipse, to focus only on their areas specific to their domain. By learning to use Eclipse as a development platform, or learning to develop your own plug-in tools for eclipse, you are acquiring a useful and flexible skill.

'''PHPEclipse is Cross Platform'''

PHP web development is performed by developers using many different operating systems and desktop environments. As PHPEclipse is available on any system which can run Java, it is an ideal choice when a single IDE is desired by a group of developers spread across a range of different environments.

'''Eclipse Provides a Wealth of Mature Development Tools'''

Eclipse provides an array of important development tools such as CVS integration, project wide text searching and manipulation. A large range of third party plugins is available for Eclipse (both free and commercial).

==Feature Overview==

===PHPEclipse Features===

* PHP, HTML, XML and CSS Syntax Highlighting
* Code completion
* Javascript Editor (?)
* Integrated web browser preview
* Integrated control of Apache &amp; MySQL servers (if using XAMP distribution) (?)
* Some PHPUnit Integration (?)
* Integrated MySQL client view using Quantum DB (?)

[[Movie_Making_Manual/Writing|Writing | Previous]]

=Rewriting=

Over 80% of your time on any screenplay will be spent on rewrites.  So much of screenwriting is about structure that you may have the story in the first few weeks while the rest of the time is spent reworking the script so the story works on the screen.

After you have plowed through and have a first draft script of 90-130 pages the best thing to do probably is to get a little distance from the screenplay so you can evaluate it objectively.  This is probably best done by laying the script aside for a few weeks and doing something else then returning to it with fresh eyes.

==Top-Down Rewriting==

Beginning writers assume that the rewriting process consists of going through the script line by line and fixing any typos or grammatical errors. After a couple of such passes they're bored and the screenplay is still weak.

To be efficient and really make progress requires being more organized and starting with the big picture. Make a series of passes through your screenplay, each time concentrating on one or two elements.

Start with the most important elements of any story such as: Is the hero really appealing and heroic? Is the villain really evil? Is there a powerful and credible conflict? Are the characters great, real, alive, right and consistent?

Strengthening these big elements might result in major restructuring of the screenplay. Only after they have been addressed is the time right to work down to issues such as spelling and grammar. Take a break for a few days at any point if necessary to get a fresh perspective.

[http://screenwriting.4filmmaking.com/script-rewriting.html A detailed rewriting strategy discussion]

=='Spitballing'==

This rather strange term comes from William Goldman's books. It means getting together with another writer and discussing your script and coming up with ideas to solve problems you are having.

It's essential to discover whether or not your story, characters, dramatic conflict, is working. A screenplay is both a sales document for the film and the blueprint, a set of instructions to the director and the actors.  An outside viewpoint is essential if you want to know if your script is going to be successful.

==Script Editors==

A good script editor is invaluable. Professional editors and coverage experts can be located by searching the web and through ads in screenwriting magazines, however the cost can be prohibitive for independent filmmakers.

Another option is to enlist friends that are avid novel readers and particularly anal-retentive at spelling and grammar. Even the most successful professional writers value the feedback of their trusted friends. If the writing is interesting enough, friends will feel compensated by just getting to be the first to read the new work and share in the creative process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The process of installing PHPEclipse has several stages. This is because PHP development with PHPEclipse relies upon a number of different pieces of software. If you already use your machine for PHP development, chances are that you will have some of these items already installed. Even if this is the case, make sure you have at least a brief glance at the items below to ensure that you have the required versions installed. The installation process should be followed in the order provided in this manual. The optional items are of course optional, but are strongly recommended.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is used to run all programs written in the Java programming language. Java 2 is required to run both Eclipse and PHPEclipse. Chances are that you will already have this installed. If not, or if you are not sure, visit Sun's [http://java.com/en/download/ Java Download Site], which will provide you with what you need (or inform you if you already have Java 2) for any operating system.

If you are using a platform with its own software management system (such as many linux distributions), you may wish to use your package management system to install Java rather than the Sun download site.

Third party Java Runtime Environments (such as [http://www.blackdown.org/ Blackdown]) are also available, and may well run this software. Feedback on this is welcome. Our current experience is that Blackdown will not successfully run Eclipse (under Gentoo Linux, Nov 2004).

      <text xml:space="preserve">With Java installed, the Eclipse Platform can now be downloaded and installed. In order to use PHP Eclipse, Eclipse version 3.0 or greater is required. You can download eclipse from the [http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/ Eclipse Download Page]. You will want to install the Latest Release, which at the time of writing is 3.0.1. This will install the Eclipse SDK. Eclipse is also available as a Platform Runtime Binary, but this will not let you use the debugging features.

Although in general Java applications are platform independent, Eclipse uses the SWT ([http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-SWT-Design-1/SWT-Design-1.html Standard Widget Toolkit]), which provides native look and feel on a range of platforms. This allows much better integration into your desktop than the normal generic Java widgets. This means, however, that you need to select the correct release of Eclipse for your operating system. A range of different downloads are provided on the download page for your selected release version. Windows and Mac users can simply select the only version for their platform. Linux users need to select the appropriate download for their architure and desktop environement.

&lt;font color=maroon&gt;Under Linux, eclipse is available for both the Motif and GTK graphical toolkits. GTK is ideal for making eclipse look like your other Gnome applications. No Eclipse version is available for QT (the KDE graphical toolkit) due to the way in which QT is licenced. KDE users will probably want to grab the GTK version. Additionally, you may find it easier to install the Eclipse SDK using your distribution's package management system. For example, under Gentoo Linux, the package dev-util/eclipse-sdk works fine with PHPEclipse.&lt;/font&gt;

To install the and Eclipse SDK zip file downloaded from eclipse.org, simple extract the file to the desired location (eg: C:\Program Files). The file contains a single directory called eclipse. To run eclipse, simple execute the eclipse file in this directory. For example, under MS Windows (if installed to the location above), then you would execute &quot;C:\Program Files\eclipse\eclipse.exe&quot;. A shortcut could be created for this location.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About Dante==
Dante (1265–1321) was born in Florence. His mother died when he was five or six, and his father, Alighiero di Bellincione, remarried to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. Dante married Gemma, and had at least three children. When he was about twenty years old, Dante met Beatrice Portinari, but not much is known of this relationship. Upon her death in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature.

In 1301, Dante was sentenced to exile and never returned to Florence again during his life. His remains lay in the Church of Santa Apollinare at Ravenna.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To install PHPEclipse, first download the latest version from SourceForge at [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57621&amp;package_id=70009 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57621&amp;package_id=70009]. The latest version will be the one at the top of the list displayed on the download page. At the time of writing, it is version 1.1.3 (filename PHPEclipse1.1.3-2005-01-29.zip). This file is platform independent.

The PHPEclipse zip files must be extracted in the same directory in which you installed Eclipse. It contains two directories, ''plugins'' and ''features'', and these must add to the plugins and features in your existing eclipse directory.

'''Note: Eclipse 3.x caches all plugin.xml files into a single repository for quicker loading. If you used eclipse before installing PHPeclipse, you should start eclipse once with the -clean option. This -clean forces Eclipse to rebuild that repository. This applies to anything that is installed into eclipse by unzipping it into its plugins folder.'''

      <comment>/* Installing AMP Using the XAMPP Distribution */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Most PHP developers find it easiest to work with a running web server on their local machine. This allows you to test your work as you go, without having to upload it to a hosting environment. Therefore, it's suggested that at this point you install Apache, PHP, and (if you are using it), MySQL. This step is required if you plan to use the php debugger. Together these tools are often referred to as AMP (or AMPP if you include Perl as well as PHP). 

==Installing AMP Using the XAMPP Distribution==

XAMPP is a software bundle which includes everything you need to install Apache/MySQL/PHP/Perl in one go. It's available for Windows, Linux and Solaris. Particularly on a Windows machine, this is definitely the fastest way to get up and running with these tools, as someone else has done the integration  and configuration work for you. Under Linux, it may be a quick solution to set up, will not be as easy to automatically maintain (or integrate with other packages) as if you installed these tools separately with your distribution's package management system (such as: apt, YaST, emerge, or up2date). This is covered in the next section.

To install XAMPP, visit their website at [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html]. Select your operating system ([http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html Windows], [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html Linux] or [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-solaris.html Solaris]), and then follow the simple installation instructions found on that page.

Note:  Since Apache needs to be able to run your php files against php, your workspace, which contains all of your php files, must be in the Apache web root (htdocs folder).  By default, this is C:\apachefriends\xampp\htdocs , but may vary depending on where you install XAMPP to.  The setting can also be configured in httpd.conf

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you've ever done any programming in a different environment than the shell, you're probably familiar with the following scenario: you're writing your program, happily typing away at the keyboard, until you notice that

* you have to repeat some code you typed earlier because your program has to perform exactly the same actions in two different locations; or
* your program is just too ''long'' to understand anymore.

In other words, you've reached the point where it becomes necessary to divide your program up into modules that can be run as separate subprograms and called as often as you like. Working in the Bourne Shell is no different than working in any other language in this respect. Sooner or later you're going to find yourself writing a shell script that's just too long to be practical anymore. And the time will have come to divide your script up into modules.

==Named functions==
Of course, the easy and obvious way to divide a script into modules is just to create a couple of different shell scripts &amp;mdash; just a few separate text files with executable permissions. But using separate files isn't always the most practical solution either. Spreading your script over multiple files can make it hard to maintain. Especially if you end up with shell scripts that aren't really meaningful unless they are called specifically from one other, particular shell script.

Especially for this situation the Bourne Shell includes the concept of a ''named function'': the possibility to associate a name with a command list and execute the command list by using the name as a command. This is what it looks like:

{{bcode:Example|''name'' '''()''' ''command group''
|Where ''name'' is a text string&lt;br/&gt;
and ''command group'' is any grouped command list (either with curly braces or parentheses)}}

This functionality is available throughout the shell and is useful in several situations. First of all, you can use it to break a long shell script up into multiple modules. But second, you can use it to define your own little macros in your own environment that you don't want to create a full script for. Many modern shells include a built-in command for this called ''alias'', but old-fashioned shells like the original Bourne Shell did not; you can use named functions to accomplish the same result.

==Creating a named function==
===Functions with a simple command group===
Let's start off simply by creating a function that prints &quot;Hello World!!&quot;. And let's call it &quot;hw&quot;. This is what it looks like:

{{code:Basic|Hello world as a named function|
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;hw() {
&gt;  echo 'Hello World!!';
&gt;}&lt;/source&gt;}}

We can use exactly the same code in a shell script or in the interactive shell &amp;mdash; the example above is from the interactive shell. There are several things to notice about this example. First of all, we didn't need a separate keyword to define a function, just the parentheses did it. To the shell, function definitions are like extended variable definitions. They're part of the environment; you set them just by defining a name and a meaning.

The second thing to note is that, once you're past the parentheses, all the normal rules hold for the command group. In our case we used a command group with braces, so we needed the semicolon after the echo command. The string we want to print contains exclamation points, so we have to quote it (as usual). And we were allowed to break the command group across multiple lines, even in interactive mode, just like normal.

Here's how you use the new function:
{{code:Output|Calling our function|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ hw&lt;/source&gt;|Hello World!!|}}

===Functions that execute in a separate process===
The definition of a function takes a command group. ''Any'' command group. Including the command group with parentheses rather than braces. So if we want, we can define a function that runs as a subprocess in its own environment as well. Here's hello world again, in a subprocess:

{{code:Basic|Hello world as a named function|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;hw() ( echo 'Hello World!!' )&lt;/source&gt;}}

It's all on one line this time to keep it short, but the same rules apply as before. And of course the same environment rules apply as well, so any variables defined in the function will not be available anymore once the function ends.

===Functions with parameters===
If you've done any programming in a different programming language you know that the most useful functions are those that take parameters. In other words, ones that don't always rigidly do the same thing but can be influenced by values passed in when the function is called. So here's an interesting question: can we pass parameters to a function? Can we create a definition like

{{bcode:Example|functionWithParams (ARG0, ARG1) { ''do something with ARG0 and ARG1'' } }}

And then make a call like 'functionWithParams(Hello, World)'? Well, the answer is simple: no. The parenthese are just there as a flag for the shell to let it know that the previous name is the name of a function rather than a variable and there is no room for parameters.

Or actually, it's more a case of the above being the simple answer rather than the answer being simple. You see, when you execute a function you are executing a command. To the shell there's really very little difference between executing a named function and executing 'ls'. It's a command like any other. And it may not be able to have parameters, but like any other command it can certainly have ''command line arguments''. So we may not be able to define a function with parameters like above, but we can certainly do this:

{{code:Output|Functions with command-line arguments
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ repeatOne () { echo $1; }
$ repeatOne 'Hello World!'&lt;/source&gt;
|Hello World!
|}}

And you can use any other variable from the environment as well. Of course, that's a nice trick for when you're calling a function from the command line in the interactive shell. But what about in a shell script? The positional variables for command-line arguments are already taken by the arguments to the shell script, right? Ah, but wait! Each command executed in the shell (no matter how it was executed) has its '''own''' set of command-line arguments! So there's no interference and you can use the same mechanism. For example, if we define a script like this:

{{code:Basic|function.sh: A function in a shell script
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh

myFunction() {
  echo $1
}

echo $1
myFunction
myFunction &quot;Hello World&quot;
echo $1&lt;/source&gt;}}

Then it executes exactly the way we want:

{{code:Output|Executing the function.sh script
|&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ . function.sh 'Goodbye World!!'&lt;/source&gt;
|Goodbye World!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hello World&lt;br/&gt;
Goodbye World!|}}

===Functions in the environment===
We've mentioned it before, but let's delve a little deeper into it now: what are functions exactly? We've hinted that they're an alias for a command list or a macro and that they're part of the environment. But what ''is'' a function exactly?

A function, as far as the shell is concerned, is just a very verbose variable definition. And that's really all it is: a name (a text string) that is associated with a value (some more text) and can be replaced by that value when the name is used. Just like a shell variable. And we can prove it too: just define a function in the interactive shell, then give the 'set' command (to list all the variable definitions in your current environment). Your function will be in the list.

Because functions are really a special kind of shell variable definition, they behave exactly the same way &quot;normal&quot; variables do:

*Functions are defined by listing their name, a definition operator and then the value of the function. Functions use a different definition operator though: '()' instead of '='. This tells the shell to add some special considerations to the function (like not needing the '$' character when using the function).
*Functions are part of the environment. That means that when commands are issued from the shell, functions are also copied into the copy of the environment that is given to the issued command.
*Functions can also be passed to new subprocesses if they are marked for export, using the 'export' command. Some shells will require a special command-line argument to 'export' for functions (bash, for instance, requires you to do an 'export -f' to export functions).
*You can drop function definitions by using the 'unset' command.

Of course, when you use them functions behave just like commands (they are expanded into a command list, after all). We've already seen that you can use command-line arguments with functions and the positional variables to match. But you can also [[Bourne Shell Scripting/Files and streams|redirect]] input and output to and from commands and pipe commands together as well.

Todo: write about Okinawa being a linguistic relative of Japanese, ww2-era efforts to get rid of the language, etc...

== ウチナーグチ vs 琉球語 vs 沖縄弁 ==
ウチナーグチ (''uchinaa guchi'') is the term that the people of Okinawa use when referring to their own language. This translates as &quot;Okinawa mouth&quot; or &quot;Okinawa language&quot;.

琉球語 (''ryuukyuugo'') is the word in standard Japanese that refers to the language of Okinawa (the &quot;Ryuukyuu kingdom&quot;, which is often spelled &quot;Ryukyu&quot;).

沖縄弁 (''okinawa-ben'') is the word for just the dialect of Okinawa. In other words, the way people from Okinawa speak Japanese.

Todo: expand this some more

== words ==
* アラン　(''aran'') : disagree
* デイジ (''deiji'') : serious
* マアサン (''maasan'') : delicious
* メンソーレ (''mensoore'') : welcome
* ウチナ (''uchina'') : Okinawa
* チュ (''chu'') : Person
* 海人: ウミンチュ (''uminchu'') : Person of the sea
* チュラ (''chura'') : pretty
* ヤナ (''yana'') : ugly
* チュラカギ / ヤナカギ (''churakagi / yanakagi'') : pretty person / ugly person

In the Okinawan dialect, it is possible to have words or names that begin with ん, which you will never see in standard 日本語.
* んたまぎる

It is also common to use phonemes that are not part of the normal (ひらがな) Japanese language (though you may see them in 外来語), such as とぅ, てぃ, and ぐぁ
* とぅい (''tui'') : bird.
* とぅんふぁ (''tunfa'') : a weapon used in Okinawan martial arts.
* やまとぅ (''yamatu'') : mainland Japan
* てぃち (''tichi'') : one thing (counter)
* いんぐぁ (''ingua'') : puppy

      <text xml:space="preserve">XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is based loosely on HTML.  XML is used mainly to store and transfer information from one protocol or language to another.  The code for XML is very open, you can create your own tags though they must follow the syntax rules of XML which are very similar to but stricter than HTML.  For Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;my_info&gt;
    &lt;my_name&gt;Jeremy&lt;/my_name&gt;
    &lt;my_hair_color&gt;Blonde&lt;/my_hair_color&gt;
 &lt;/my_info&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, the structure is almost identical to that of HTML, but you are able to define your own tags.

# Negative conjugation
# Expand on habitual and stative verbs.
}}

The ～ている form has several uses.  
* Progressive
* Completed actions
* Stative
* Habitual
* Incomplete actions 

== Conjugation ==
While Japanese grammar doesn't always correspond to what we know from English, they both use auxiliary verbs in many circumstances.

Continuous tenses in English use the auxiliary verbs '''am''', '''are''', '''is''', '''was''' and '''were'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! past/non-past Tense !! Continuous past/non-past tense
|-
|I ride the train.
|I am riding the train.
|-
| I rode the train.
| I was riding the train.
|-
|He talks to a friend.
|He is talking to a friend.
|-
| He talked to a friend.
| He was talking to a friend.
|}

The Japanese language has a similar auxiliary verb '''いる''' with the ～て form of the verb.  

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Politeness of the 〜て form'''
! colspan=&quot;1&quot; | !! Non-past tense !! Past Tense 
|-
! Polite
| +います || +いました
|-
! Plain
| +いる || +いた
|}

== Uses ==

=== Continuous Actions ===
{{wikipedia|Continuous and progressive aspects}}
When speaking of continuous actions that occur in the present or occurred in the past, the form has the same meaning as the English continuous tense.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | past/non-past tense 
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | English
|-
! Plain || Polite
|-
| テレビを{{furi|見|み|ている}}。
| テレビを{{furi|見|み|ています}}。
|  I am watching television.
|-
| {{furi|音楽|おんがく}}を{{furi|聞|き|いている}}。
| {{furi|音楽|おんがく}}を{{furi|聞|き|いています}}。
| I am listening to music.
|-
| {{furi|雑誌|ざっし}}を{{furi|読|よ|んでいる}}。
| {{furi|雑誌|ざっし}}を{{furi|読|よ|んでいます}}。
|  I am reading a magazine.
|-
| {{furi|宿題|しゅくだい}}をしていた。
| {{furi|宿題|しゅくだい}}をしていました。
| I was doing my homework.
|-
| {{furi|友達|ともだち}}と{{furi|食|た|べていた}}。
| {{furi|友達|ともだち}}と{{furi|食|た|べていました}}。
| I was eating with a friend.
|}

=== Incomplete tasks ===

When you take the present-negative conjugation of いる, you're left with a sense an action not taking place.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | past/non-past tense 
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | English
|-
! Plain || Polite 
|-
| テストの{{furi|勉強|べんきょう}}をしていない || テストの{{furi|勉強|べんきょう}}をしていません||  I haven't done any studying for the test.
|-
|{{furi|宿題|しゅくだい}}をしていない
| まだ{{furi|宿題|しゅくだい}}をしていません
| I haven't done the homework yet.
|}

=== Habitual ===

This form may also be used to describe a habitual activity.  

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;padding-left: 2em; width: 50%;&quot; | USAトゥデーの新聞を読んでいます。
| I read the USA Today newspaper.
|}

=== Stative vs Non-stative verbs ===
Much like English, there are verbs that describe a state of the subject, rather than an action.  These type of verbs are called [[w:stative verbs|stative verbs]].  You may want to think of these as actions that started in the past, arrived to a state, and this state persists to the present.

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;padding-left: 2em; width: 50%;&quot; | 図書館は今、開いています。
| The library is open.
|}

=== くる, いく, and かえる ===
When the verbs くる, いく, and かえる are used in the ～て in conjuction with the auxiliary verb いる, they're translated as '''has come''', '''has gone''', and '''has returned''', respectively.

== Exceptions ==

There are some irregular cases with this form.  

# You can use the word 知っています, but not 知っていません.  Instead, you'll use the negative form of masu - 知りません.
# You also can't use ある, いる, and 要る in the ～ている form at all.  The same can be said with potential forms of verbs (e.g., 話せる).

== Colloquial Variations ==
When speaking at a high speed, sometimes syllables are dropped from words to make them easier to say. Colloquial variations of the continuous forms exist and are recognized in the Japanese language. While they are not used in proper writing, these forms are used in every day conversation, especially among friends and family.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;  
! colspan=&quot;1&quot; | !! Standard !! Colloquial variation 
|-
! Plain
| {{furi|電車|でんしゃ}}に{{furi|乗|の|っている}}
| {{furi|電車|でんしゃ}}に{{furi|乗|の|ってる}}
|-
! Polite 
| {{furi|電車|でなしゃ}}に{{furi|乗|の|っています}}
| {{furi|電車|でんしゃ}}に{{furi|乗|の|ってます}}
|}

All the sentences mean &quot;I am riding the train.&quot; Notice that the two sentences on the right have simply dropped the い　from いる／います. By dropping the い, the sentence becomes easier to say quickly. This is a standard colloquial form of the continuous tense, and it works with the non-past continuous and the past continuous. The above example is the present continuous, so let's see an example of the past continuous:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! colspan=&quot;1&quot; | !! Standard !! Colloquial variation 
|-
! Plain 
| {{furi|妹|いもうと}}と{{furi|遊|あそ|んでいた}}
| {{furi|妹|いもうと}}と{{furi|遊|あそ|んでた}}
|-
! Polite 
| {{furi|妹|いもうと}}と{{furi|遊|あそ|んでいました}}
| {{furi|妹|いもうと}}と{{furi|遊|あそ|んでました}}
|}

Once again, the い was dropped, which forms the colloquial variation. Just remember to use the standard form when writing, but when speaking, the colloquial version will be OK when speaking among friends. However, when speaking to someone of higher status, you may wish to use the standard polite 
form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the past several centuries, Christian Theologians point to the story of Adam and Eve as the Origin of Sin. This story proceeds that after God created Adam and Eve he also gave them instruction not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. A serpent, identified later in the Bible as Satan, persuaded Eve to eat of the fruit of this tree which God told them not to eat. She gave some fruit to Adam, and he also ate of it. They gained the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and then knew they were naked and were ashamed, and hurried to clothe themselves. God found them and, because they had disobeyed Him, cast them out of the Garden of Eden.  Mercifully, He also bestowed the gift of death, so that they would not live forever, separated from Himself.

This sin is believed to have been transmitted down the generations, a sin which only the sacrifice of Jesus could rectify. The Bible says that sin entered the world through one man, Adam. Sin is nothing more than disobedience of God. It is often argued that God created evil, but that could not be, since God is perfect.&lt;ref&gt;This is human logic. Human logic would also conclude that if you give power to do evil to a force when the force had no such power before, then you have created evil.&lt;/ref&gt;  He created mankind with free will, which included the ability to choose to disobey Him.  Without that ability to choose, man could never have chosen to love God; rather, we would have been like little wind-up dolls that always say, &quot;i love you&quot;, without really meaning it.  With Adam's choice&lt;ref&gt;''''However, Adam was not present when Eve  picked the fruit. There is nothing to say that she ever told him where the fruit came from. Therefore, Adam may have eaten without ever knowing from where it came. There is a second version of Genesis embedded within the other. One version merely observes that Adam and Eve left the Garden. All of this seems like a thin branch many would argue to claim God would separate us from God for such acts. Perhaps, only we can choose to separate ourselves. If we do, it's speculative what can happen, but without that choice,(rejecting God) God loves us.&lt;/ref&gt;, sin entered the world and with it death.''''

We are born with the stain of that original sin, and our nature is to satisfy ourselves rather than obey God.  But God cannot tolerate sin or be in its presence.  We sinners have to have another way of getting to God's abode, which we call heaven.  God so loved the (people in the) world that He gave His only Son to die a sacrificial death, to atone for man's sins, and to provide the redemption that man needs in order to get to heaven and live forever in God's presence.  But He placed a condition on that redemption:  believe in Jesus as the Savior, the One capable of forgiving one's sins.  That belief leads to repentance and a desire to please God.

Can someone explain to me what direction they think this book is intended to take? I'd be happy to help out, but I'd don't think the goal is clear.  Is this intended to be a history of, introduction to, user guide for, or something else altogether? I think making real progress on a useful book would go better is a direction were to be given. --[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 04:33, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Author==
Why does it say that the Linux &quot;Operating System&quot; was written by Linux Torvalds?
No disrespect to the man, but he did not write the operating system.
That was started by Richard Stallman 5 years before Linus started working on his kernel.

Linux is a kernel of an operating system.

Unless someone has any objections, I would like to modify this article.
:Since early November of this year the opening line has been: 
:''Linux is a Unix-like open source '''kernel''' written by Linus Torvalds...''
:So I'm not clear on what your concern is. --[[User:Ahc|Ahc]] 16:57, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::From a Linux developer who's been following Linux for over a decade... '''NO.'''

::The GNU project was indeed started first, and Linux (the whole thing) does indeed use some tools from the GNU project. The X and BSD projects are even older, and the GNU project uses parts of them. Heck, the GNU kernel uses large chunks of Linux kernel code for hardware drivers, filesystem support, and networking. If we are to believe that it is somehow right to give credit in the ''name'' of an OS, then why is GNU not crediting Linux for providing Hurd with life support? Why is GNU not crediting X or BSD?

::GNU/Linux is a very obvious attempt to latch onto success. This is being done very rudely and forcefully, without getting concensus from the actual developers. This goes on at many levels, including the OS names used to configure projects that use the auto* tools. In no way did the GNU project write the Linux OS. Parts of the GNU OS were found suitable for Linux, just as parts of BSD were found suitable for GNU.

::BTW, OS kernels do not traditionally have distinct names. They are &quot;the kernel&quot; or &quot;the exec&quot;.

::Finally, we have the simple facts of marketing. At least in English, &quot;GNU&quot; is a very ugly sounding word. The &quot;/&quot; looks complicated and hostile. Humans have emotional responses to sounds, like it or not.

::[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 21:43, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::Reading the GNU philosophies when talking about them is as important as reading the manual for a program.
:::[[User:A thing|A thing]] 05:01, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:::The filename of the kernel is linux-''version''.tar.bz2. The simlink to the source is /usr/src/linux. The kernel image is usually stored, or the simlink is /boot/vmlinuz. Besides, calling it only Linux makes it seem as if it is made as one giant product. Unlike Windows, a distribution is actually a zillion independent projects being either pressed, or burned onto a series of CDs.

::::Well, as I said: &quot;OS kernels do not traditionally have distinct names.&quot; As for the zillion independent projects, I'd say that's a good argument ''against'' the &quot;GNU/&quot; crud. My own independent project, procps, does not support the GNU kernel (Hurd) at all. Some of the old and important projects, like X, predate the whole GNU idea. Lots of recent (and not-so-recent) code is coming from BSD. Even the so-called &quot;GNU&quot; projects, like gcc and glibc, are mainly supported by Linux vendors and embedded systems companies. The true history of Linux is that the ''kernel'' was written, and then people like Theodore T'so and H. J. Lu went around to various places (BSD, GNU, alt.sources usenet archives, etc.) grabbing what was needed to have a userspace. In general, the early core developers of Linux have never accepted &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; as a legit term. Many have objected. Today the term is even an abuse of the Linux trademark registered to Linus Torvalds. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:23, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::::Also, uname --kernel-name prints &quot;Linux&quot;, while uname --operating-system, prints &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;. Tools that are estential to GNU/Linux, like coreutils, gcc, glibc, bash, where all originaly created by the GNU project. Also, the whole philosphy came from the GNU project. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 03:39, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::::Guess why the &quot;--operating-system&quot; option was invented. As I said above, this recent political power grab is &quot;being done very rudely and forcefully&quot;. By this I mean things like the uname command. Some tools, essential to '''Linux'''&amp;reg;, were created by the BSD project, yet we do not call the OS BSD/Linux. All of the &quot;GNU&quot; tools you mention have been primarily developed by Linux distributers. If you go back prior to the Linux effort, these tools were trivial junk. It would have been nearly as easy to use BSD code, but by chance, FSF &quot;GNU&quot; tools were chosen. Only a small part of the philosophy comes from the GNU project; BSD is older and wasn't even the first. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:24, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::::::So? How much of the kernel do you think was written by Linux Torvalds? Not much. But he's givin credit because he started it. Besides, RMS can do what you said, because the FSF distributes the coreutils package that contains uname. And yes, GNU/Linux uses part of BSD, just like every other opearting system does. Waddya mean only a little bit of the philosphy comes from GNU? The kernel uses the GNU GPL. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 14:26, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::::::It doesn't matter how much of Linux&amp;reg; was written by Linus. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that an operating system name is an appropriate place to be giving ''anyone'' credit. Linus didn't name his own OS, and even if he had, so what? The name is a good-sounding marketable name in most (all?) languages. &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; is an abomination, purely political, created because RMS was sore about his Hurd project being upstaged by Linux. RMS is jealous and whiny, and should be treated as such. The GNU GPL is only a codification of prior existing philosophy. RMS didn't invent the idea. Sure, we can give him credit for getting a lawyer to write things up, but ''not'' in the operating system name. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:57, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::::::Note that Windows is not called Bill/Windows, and MacOS is not called SteveOS. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:57, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::::::Suppose you wrote an OS, and your friend named it Reubal. Then a few other friends help you port some BSD code to run on your system, along with whatever else they can find. Years later, when Reubal is having major success, Marshall Kirk McKusick rudely and jealously demands that you call your OS &quot;Reubsdal&quot; to give himself credit. Your friends ridicule this offensive idea. Marshall Kirk McKusick then starts telling everyone that your OS is really named BSD/Reubal. Soon, many outsiders start to believe this tale. After all, if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 17:57, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::::P.S. The X Windows System isn't really part of the operating system, it's a program that's run on it, similar to how one might run WinRAR on Windows. Sure, it's estential for every user, but it's not part ot the core of the operating system. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 03:43, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::::Even Richard Stallman considers X to be part of a GNU operating system. Part of his claim to owning the right to rename Linux&amp;reg; is that he himself had the idea to cobble together a complete system from X, BSD, and more. When a crowd of Linux hackers (H. J. Lu and Theodore T'so in particular) did this, Richard Stallman felt that his idea had been stolen. Well, the idea was obvious, and Richard Stallman didn't patent it. Even AT&amp;amp;T and Sun were doing this with commercial UNIX&amp;reg;. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:24, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Naming issues aside, just count the times someone says that the Linux '''Operating System''' was firstly written by Linus Torvalds and you will know what is unfair in this discussion. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:57, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

== Joining [[Guide to UNIX]]? ==

I added [[Linux]] to the table of contents for [[Guide to UNIX]].
*I had wanted a Guide to UNIX/BSD page. I found and expanded a [[BSD]] stub.
*I noticed that the Linux module was mostly links. My idea is that this page is not [[wikipedia:Linux|the Wikipedia article]], nor [[Linux For Newbies]], nor [[Linux software howtos]], nor [[BSD bookshelf]]. I made this module analogous with BSD module.
*Thus I decided to use this page instead of making a Guide to UNIX/Linux page.
[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:59, 2 October 2005 (UTC)
: I propose renaming [[Linux]] to [[Guide to UNIX/Linux and GNU]]. Comment here. [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 22:06, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
:: Moved, minus the political nonsense. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:06, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
::: Good. Call it [[Guide to UNIX/Linux]] because it is not about GNU. [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:18, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

After the move, [[Linux]] still redirected to here. I tried to make [[Linux]] point to [[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf#Linux]] instead so people who type &quot;Linux&quot; and click Go would see the list of Wikibooks for Linux. However, automatic redirect drops the part after #... So now I am expecting that readers going to [[Linux]] will see [[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf]] and be able to find the Linux section. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:35, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</text>

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The '''begin''' keyword in [[Ada Programming|Ada]] is almost synonymous with the &lt;tt&gt;{&lt;/tt&gt; in [[Programming:C|C]]/[[Programming:C_plus_plus|C++]]/[[Programming:Java|Java]].  In the paradigm of structured programming languages, a keyword or symbol is often needed to delimit the beginning of the body from the element (i.e. if, elsif, for loop, while loop) to which it pertains.

For the case of subprograms, packages, tasks and blocks this word is {{Ada/kw|begin}}.

For example
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Some_Procedure {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
     Do_Something;
     Do_Something_Else;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Some_Procedure;

The '''begin''' keyword is always closed with the {{Ada/keyword|end}} keyword. The opposite is not true in Ada.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Burning CDs and DVDs with K3B  ==

K3B ([http://www.k3b.org/Website: k3b.org]) is a CD and DVD burner for Linux. Technically, it is a front-end for some of the commands given in the &quot;using the console&quot; section below.

K3B requires [[w:KDE|KDE]] (see also [[Using KDE|KDE how-to]]) to run.

== Burning CDs and DVDs with Brasero ==

Brasero ([http://projects.gnome.org/brasero/ gnome.org]) is a popular GTK+ CD burning software. It is part of the GNOME project. 

==Burning CDs and DVDs using xcdroast==
xcdroast ([http://www.xcdroast.org/]) is an alternative front end to cdrtools, which does not require KDE. Similarly to K3B and other such programs, it acts as a front end to automate commands which would normally be entered from the console.

== Burning CDs and DVDs using the Console ==

=== 1. Make an ISO Image ===

An [[w:ISO image|ISO Image]] is a file which contains all the data required on the CD or DVD - that is, all the files plus the directory structure. An ISO file is about the same size as all the files it is created from.

There are several ISO formats available, 

To make the ISO in Linux, use '''mkisofs''. mkisofs has many options to control how to handle CD and DVD creation - these include how linux-style filenames are converted to work for Windows and Apple Mac, and options for creation of a boot-cd. However, the standard command is:

; mkisofs -r -o ''&lt;file&gt;'' ''&lt;dir&gt;''

The easiest way to make an CD/DVD image is to copy all the files required in a new directory, such as &quot;myproject&quot;. Then just run the command
 mkisofs -r -o /tmp/myimage.iso myproject
to create the image. The image size should not be larger than the size of the CD (~ 700MB) or DVD (~ 4.4GB).

Note also that the FAT32 file system can only manage files of less than 4GB (which is less than the maximum DVD size)

=== 2. Identify a CD drive ===

To burn the CD or DVD, we'll use ''cdrecord''. The following command lists all the CD-R and DVD-R drives. and provides an address (a SCSI-style address)
 cdrecord -scanbus

=== 3. Burn the CD ===
Burn the CD or DVD with:
 cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=''&lt;dev&gt;'' [blank=fast] -data  ''&lt;cd_image&gt;''
Use blank=fast to clear all data from a CD-RW. cd_image is the ISO file created in step 1.

Example:
 cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,6,0 -data  /tmp/myimage.iso

== Creation of Video DVDs ==

For DVDs to work in a DVD player, the movies and file structure must be very specific. A guide to creating a DVD video is given at [http://wiki.videolan.org/ VideoLan Wiki] - see [http://wiki.videolan.org/How_to_Create_a_DVD Making a DVD Video with VLC].

== Comparative ==

The main methods of constructing comparative sentences use the words &quot;より&quot; and &quot;{{furi|方|ほう}}&quot;. They can be used individually or together. The former indicates inferiority while the latter superiority (but note that ''superiority'' can indicate &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;cheaper&quot;, &quot;smaller&quot;, etc).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;superior object&gt; の方が &lt;inferior object&gt; より &lt;adjective&gt; です
|}

Let's look at a few examples asserting that pizza (ピザ) is more delicious than sushi ({{furi|寿司|すし}}). Take the noun that is superior (in this case, more delicious) and affix &quot;の{{furi|方|ほう}}が&quot; to it. Then, take the inferior noun and append it with &quot;より&quot;:
{{Japanese example|
: ピザの方が寿司より
}}
This essentially means &quot;Pizza is more than sushi.&quot; but we have yet to explain in what fashion pizza out-does sushi. In this case, we are describing how delicious so we choose &quot;おいしい&quot;. To be polite, we will add the polite copula &quot;です&quot; to the end of the sentence.
{{Japanese example|
: ピザ'''の方が'''寿司'''より'''おいしいです。
}}
The adjective can be changed to anything you'd like.
{{Japanese example|
: ピザ'''の方が'''寿司'''より'''{{furi|臭|くさ|い}}です。// Pizza is smellier than sushi.
: ピザ'''の方が'''寿司'''より'''{{furi|安|やす|い}}です。// Pizza is cheaper than sushi.
}}

=== Variations ===
It doesn't matter which part comes first; &quot;〜の方が&quot; or &quot;〜より&quot; so the following are both grammatically correct:
{{Japanese example|
: ピザ'''の方が'''寿司'''より'''おいしいです。
: 寿司'''より'''ピザ'''の方が'''おいしいです。
}}
The adjective, however, must always come last with the copula.

One may drop one of &quot;より&quot; or &quot;の方&quot; when the comparison is clear from context.
{{Japanese example|
: そのピザはおいしいですか？ — Is that pizza tasty?
: はい、でも寿司の方がおいしかったです。 — Yes, but the sushi was tastier.
: はい、寿司よりです。 — Yes, better than the sushi.}}

Though it is not standard, &quot;の方が&quot; can be replaced with &quot;は&quot;. Some people may find this easier to remember.

Instead of &quot;より&quot;, you can say &quot;よりも&quot;. This is mostly restricted to speech and adds emphasis. Others may use it simply because they like to say it instead of plain &quot;より&quot;. You can choose for yourself which you'd like to use.
{{Japanese example|
: ピザ'''の方が'''寿司'''よりも'''おいしいですよ！
}}

There is also &quot;もっと&quot; which means &quot;more&quot; or &quot;to a greater degree&quot;.
{{Japanese example|
: 一緒だともっと楽しいです。 — It's more enjoyable together.}}

== Superlative ==

In Japanese one can express the superlative by stating that it is &quot;''the most ~''&quot;, or that is &quot;''more ~ than anything/anyone''&quot;.

=== The most ~ ===

Depending on formality, you may use &quot;もっとも&quot; or &quot;一番&quot; (いちばん, ''e.'' number one). The superlative is formed by prepending this to the adjective.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| style=&quot;color:gray&quot; | (&lt;subject&gt; は/が) || もっとも&lt;br /&gt;一番 || &lt;adjective&gt; || です&lt;br /&gt;だ || 。
|}
{{Japanese example|
: 一番おいしい // The most delicious.
: 一番{{furi|高|たか|い}} // The most expensive (or The highest).
: 一番{{furi|長|なが|い}} // The longest.
: 一番{{furi|悲|かな|しい}} // The saddest.
}}
With a subject:
{{Japanese example|
: 一番{{furi|素敵|すてき|な}}{{furi|人|ひと}}です。 // The greatest person.
: {{furi|彼女|かのじょ}}にとって、{{furi|私|わたし}}は{{furi|一番|いちばん}}{{furi|素敵|すてき|な}}{{furi|人|ひと}}です。// From my girlfriend's point of view, I am the greatest person.
}}
You can also modify a noun by placing it after the adjective. Take a look at these examples:
{{Japanese example|
: この{{furi|小説|しょうせつ}}は一番{{furi|有名|ゆうめい}}です。 // This novel is the most famous.
: これは一番{{furi|有名|ゆうめい|な}}{{furi|小説|しょうせつ}}です。 // This is the most famous novel.
: その{{furi|映画|えいが}}は一番{{furi|悲|かな|しい}}です。// That movie is the saddest.
: それは一番{{furi|悲|かな|しい}}{{furi|映画|えいが}}です。// That is the saddest movie.
}}

=== More than anything ===
This method has two forms with the same structure, but a different word depending on whether it refers to something that is animate or inanimate.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! animate
| &lt;Name, pronoun or creature&gt; || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | は || {{furi|誰|だれ}} || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | より (Adjective) です。
|-
! inanimate
| &lt;Noun&gt; || {{furi|何|なに}}
|}
Instead of just &quot;{{furi|何|なに}}より&quot;or &quot;{{furi|誰|だれ|より}}&quot;, you can say &quot;{{furi|何|なに}}よりも&quot; or &quot;{{furi|誰|だれ}}よりも&quot;. It's up to you which form you choose to use. Here are some examples!
{{Japanese example|
: お{{furi|母|かあ}}さん'''は誰より'''{{furi|恋|こい|しい}}です。 // I miss my mother more than anyone.
: この{{furi|手紙|てがみ}}'''は何より'''{{furi|大切|たいせつ}}です！ // This letter is more important to me than anything!
: この{{furi|歌|うた}}'''は何よりも'''きれいですね。 // This song is prettier than anything, isn't it?
}}

{{TODO|How to get access to the Internet in Japan?}}

== Computing in Japanese ==

=== Windows ===
It is necessary to do some minor changes in order to displaying Japanese text.

==== Windows 2000/XP ====
For Windows 2000/XP reading support, you will need to install a [[Wikipedia:Unicode|Unicode]] typeface, such as 'Code2000' or [[Wikipedia:Arial|Arial]] Unicode MS. Both will cover nearly all of the non-Latin scripts used throughout Wikipedia.

For input support, you will need to install the East Asian language files. You can do this from the 'Control Panel'. Open the 'Regional and Language Options' and navigate to the 'Languages' tab. Minimally, you will want to check the box for 'Install files for East Asian languages', though you may wish to also install the complex script files, too. Clicking 'Apply' will install the 'Arial Unicode MS', 'MS Mincho' and 'MS Gothic' families of fonts. All of these fonts contain the [[Wikipedia:Hiragana|Hiragana]] and [[Wikipedia:Katakana|Katakana]] scripts, as well as a substantial majority of the Kanji characters most commonly used. 

Depending on how your computer was initially setup, you may need the original source CD to complete the installation. Your computer will prompt you to insert the CD if it is necessary

If this does not work you can also download and install the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=24A66277-CD9F-4332-A6F1-52B85A6470BD&amp;displaylang=en&amp;Hash=VQCJ9MB Office XP Tool: Japanese Language Pack] from the Microsoft website.

==== Inputting Japanese Text ====

In the 'Regional and Language Options' Control Panel applet, choose the 'Languages' tab. Ensure that the 'Install files for East Asian languages' checkbox is selected. Click the 'Details...' button. Click the 'Add' button and choose 'Japanese'. Click the 'OK' buttons as necessary to close all dialog boxes.

To test the new settings, open any Unicode-enabled text processing application, such as [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]]. Press the combination ''[Alt]+[Shift]'' on your keyboard until 'JP' replaces 'EN' in the new section of your taskbar. To input hiragana, enter the Japanese input mode by pressing ''[Alt]+[~]''.

Type a Japanese word using romaji keys (e.g. &quot;''nihongo''&quot;) and either press ''[Enter]'' to leave that text in hiragana (e.g. &quot;にほんご&quot;), [F7] to change the text into katakana, or ''[Spacebar]'' then ''[Enter]'' to choose an alternative version containing kanji (e.g. &quot;日本語&quot;).

To return to English input mode, press ''[Alt]+[~]'' again.

=== Windows 95/98/ME ===
To install a Japanese typeface, simply open '''Internet Explorer''' and open a web page coded in Japanese. An Install-on-Demand window should appear, asking to install Japanese text support. After completing this install, the Japanese page should display correctly. (Please note: Wikibooks is not coded in Japanese. Try [http://www.google.co.jp/ Google in Japanese].)

=== Mac OS X ===
Apple computers display Japanese characters out of the box, and are capable of inputting Japanese characters very simply. To do so, open up System Preferences (located in the &quot;Dock&quot;) or click the Apple icon in the top left of your display and click 'System Preferences...'. Next, select 'International' and then the 'Input Menu' tab. Scroll down until you see 'Kotoeri' and check the box to the left of it. This will by default enable the input methods 'Hiragana', 'Katakana' and 'Romaji'.

To switch between your normal input and Hiragana quickly you can do one of two things. The first way to do this is to enable the input menu in the menu bar (you do this by checking the box next to 'Show input menu in menu bar' in the same place described previously), this will put a flag in the upper right part of your display. To change between input methods click the flag and select the new method. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard combination Command + Space Bar to switch between methods, although this is problematic in Apple's new operating system Tiger as this is also the shortcut for Spotlight. There are also direct shortcuts of Ctrl-Shift-; for Romaji, Ctrl-Shift-J for Hiragana, and Ctrl-Shift-K for Katakana.

Please note, while in the Hiragana input method you can temporarily switch to Katakana by holding down the shift key in much the same way that you temporarily hold down the shift key to type capital letters in English.

=== X11 (GNU/Linux, UNIX-like, etc.) ===
For displaying Japanese, you will need the correct fonts selected. Please refer to your distribution's documentation for more on that.

You will need a helper application for inputting Japanese characters. The most prominent are:
* [http://code.google.com/p/uim/ uim]
* [http://www.scim-im.org/ SCIM]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Humans divide objects which they observe into categories.  According to one definition, Philosophy is the discipline of how humans determine these categories, communicate about them and interact with them. 

Aesthetics is the sub-discipline of philosophy which acknowledges that humans interact with their environment in the context of sensual experiences.  

These experiences include color and sound.  A question which is fair game for Aesthetics might be: &quot;What combinations of notes sound good together?&quot;  This is an old question and may demonstrate various trends in philosophy.  The answer to this question changes over time.  The categories of which chords sound good and which sound bad have changed over time.  

Another similar question is which colors look good together.  This is completely analogous to the above question about musical harmonies.  One may also ask which colors or sounds may easily be distinguished. 

A philosopher who is inclined towards linguistics may take the result of these inquiries and ask what languages are possible given the combinations of symbols such as colors or harmony rather than the symbols of distinguishable vocal utterances.

You should read the excellent Irving Stone books about Van Gogh (&quot;Lust for Life&quot;) and Michelangelo (&quot;The Agony and the Ecstacy&quot;) what you will take from them is a new appreciation of the learning process and development of the artist.  Both of these men accepted that it would take them years to get to grips with their media -- as not only did they want to master their mediums but both were revolutionizing them, taking both painting and sculpture into unexplored territories.  The realisation both artists had was that not only would the development take time but that they also needed to live life along the way.

Peter Biskind (a close observer of filmmakers and filmmaking) said that, apart from a few exceptional cases (Welles, Tarantino), it takes at least five to ten years for a director to learn this art/craft.  Sometimes it seems like we can be in a huge rush to get there: we make a couple of shorts and then want to make a feature with a big budget.  Michelangelo spent years drawing, working with wax and clay before being trusted with expensive marble.

Go a bit easy on yourself if a few years into your film career you have not made something with which you are hugely pleased; this is a complex art form requiring many technical skills and a lot of knowledge and experience, and the tools are in the midst of a huge revolution.  Expect things to take awhile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Microeconomics?==

'''Microeconomics''' is how people deal with money, time, and resources. Microeconomics deals with the individual aspect of it while ''macroeconomics'' deals with aggregates at the level of an entire economy (e.g. total demand or total supply of goods in the national economy).  Microeconomics deals with the economic interactions of a specific person, a single entity or a company. These interactions, which mainly are buying and selling goods, occur in markets. In other words Microeconomics is the study of individual market. For instance an economist may study the market for compact discs, the firms that sell compact discs and any other groups that influence the price and availability of compact discs, such as the government. 

The branch of economics that analyzes the market behavior of individual consumers and firms in an attempt to understand the decision-making process of firms and households. It is concerned with the interaction between individual buyers and sellers and the factors that influence the choices made by buyers and sellers. In particular, microeconomics focuses on patterns of supply and demand and the determination of price and output in individual markets (e.g. coffee industry).

There are two main concepts that we need to understand in Microeconomics that form the basis of not only Microeconomics, but all economic theory. The concepts are supply and demand, and scarcity. With just these two concepts, we can understand almost all human economic behavior. Or Microeconomics is field of economics is broken down into two distinct areas of study: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics looks at the smaller picture and focuses more on basic theories of supply and demand and how individual businesses decide how much of something to produce and how much to charge for it. People who have any desire to start their own business or who want to learn the rationale behind the pricing of particular products and services would be more interested in this area.

Macroeconomics, on the other hand, looks at the big picture (hence &quot;macro&quot;). It focuses on the national economy as a whole and provides a basic knowledge of how things work in the business world. For example, people who study this branch of economics would be able to interpret the latest Gross Domestic Product figures or explain why a 6% rate of unemployment is not necessarily a bad thing. Thus, for an overall perspective of how the entire economy works, you need to have an understanding of economics at both the micro and macro levels.

Monetary economics is the study of the money market in an economy - the market which, in most macroeconomic models, is represented by the supply of savings available to meet the demand for investment. In the basic macroeconomic models, this market is assumed to clear, by means of an equilibrium interest rate. However, in most countries residing in the real world, the interest rate is managed by the central bank, simply because the money market tends not to clear on its own. The ability to set the interest rate has become a powerful economic management tool in the arsenal of finance ministers throughout the world today, but there are some instances where countries have voluntarily given it up.

This document will attempt to define the nebulous item often labelled as 'money' by economists. It will then set out the factors affecting the demand and supply of money in an economy, and explore the reasons why the money market does not clear. This document will then move on to monetary policy and global monetary economic history - the practice and ramifications of 'real world' monetary economics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Money?==

It is useful when defining the entity 'money' to look at what 'money' is used for, at least according to economists. There are 3 generally accepted uses of money:

# As a medium of exchange
# As a unit of account
# As a store of value

We can then approach the question of exactly what 'money' is by taking 'money' to mean that entity which we can use to fulfil the functions of 'money', as defined above. It is then possible to measure money in the real world, making decisions as to what form of monetary balance would meet our criteria of what 'money' is. Moreover, this approach enables us to section the money market along the various lines defined by the different motives to hold money, increasing the flexibility of our analytic model.

This section will look at each function of money in turn, and examine how each function affects the definition of money. We then look at the practical measurement of money in the real world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Money as a Unit of Account==

===The Classical Function of Money===
Classical economists modelled the demand for money in terms of its use as a unit of account. Money can be used to denote the value of goods, enabling participants in a transaction to measure the value of the transaction item in a common factor. This reduces transaction costs, especially information costs, as there is less possibility of adverse selection.

Under a barter system with no common unit of accounting, a successful transaction depends on the occurrence of a coincidence of wants. This could be surmounted by one party giving credit to another, that is, for the party to accept payment in kind in the future for a good sold today. Even if there were no credit risk (i.e. payment could be strictly enforced) the selling party would still have to gather information regarding the future worth of the good he is contracted to be paid in. 

In addition, the selling party would have to know the values of all goods in the economy, denominated in the values of every other good. This causes the information costs required to trade to rise significantly.

====Example - the generalised case of n commodities====

If there are 2 commodities in the economy, for trade to take place only one price need be known by the trading parties. If there are 3 commodities, the price of commodity A in terms of commodities B and C must be known, and the price of commodity B in terms of commodity C, giving a total of 3 prices. And so on, as the number of commodities rises. For &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; commodities the number of prices is given by: 


&lt;math&gt;{n(n-1)} \over 2&lt;/math&gt;


Given the presence of a universal denominator of value however, the number of prices that must be known is reduced to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. (Meltzer, 1998)

===The Price Level===

Transactions denominated in a common unit of account would determine prices, and it would then be possible to aggregate these prices into a price level for the economy. Given the price level, it is therefore possible to determine inflation. Here money does not affect the real value of the transactions in the economy. Money would therefore be said to be neutral, if the unit of account function were the only function of money in the economy.

===The Standard of Deferred Payment===

A related function is the standard of deferred payment, whereby money is defined as that entity used to specify future payments for current transactions. Here there is a relation to the store of value function, as the nominal value of money now and at the payment time in the future is invariant, making the contracted future payment affected by the interest rate. Of course, the real value of the future payment is also affected by inflation.

===Money under the Unit of Account Function===

Put simply, anything that enables transactions to be valued. The definition of money used here can constitute the money stock, bank deposits, etc etc. There is a slight distinction between the money stock defined under the function of money as a means of exchange and the function of money as a unit of account, as prices need not be defined in the currency used as a means of exchange. However in this case an exchange rate between the currency used as a means of account and the currency used as a means of exchange must be known. The money stock is the amount of money as defined under the means of exchange function.

====Example - The island of Yap====

On the island of Yap in Micronesia, large stones were used as money. Due to the problems associated with transporting such stones, islanders soon moved to an exchange system whereby claims on the stones were used in a transaction. Here the unit of account was the stones, while the means of exchange was the claims (written down on paper). However, there was a well defined exchange rate between claim and stone.

The money supply here does not encompass both the stock of claims and the stock of stones however. It consists of the stock of stones, or the stock of claims as defined by the exchange rate between claim and stone.

==Money as an Asset==

===Money and Bonds===

To analyse this motive for holding money properly we need to distinguish between 'money' and 'bonds'. Bonds here are defined as any sort of asset that pays interest, while money does not pay any interest income. We further assume that the asset allocation choice is purely between money and bonds, that is, a person can only hold either money or bonds, implying that holding money incurs a cost - that of interest income foregone.

===The Speculative Motive===

Economic agents who hold money for this motive hold it because there is the price of money is invariant to the rate of interest, unlike bonds. It protects the agent from any risk associated with changes in the interest rate.

In this instance, money acts as a store of value, allowing the agent to transfer real purchasing power from the present to the future (assuming inflation is zero). Bonds are not as useful as money here because their value changes with fluctuations in the interest rate.

===Money under the Asset Function===

So what constitutes money under this definition? Essentially, anything that doesn't pay interest income, but can be used as a store of wealth, and does not change its nominal value under changes in interest rates. In this case, interest bearing bank deposits are not counted as money. The definition of money is likely to be confined to the money stock and non-interest bearing bank deposits.

==Money as a Means of Exchange==

===The Transactions and Precautionary Motives===

These motives for holding money were initially postulated by Keynes. The transactions motive is simply that money is required in order to make transactions, and therefore any economic agent who wants to make transactions will want to hold money.

The precautionary motive is related to the transactions motive. In an economy where there is uncertainty regarding the timing of economic transactions, i.e. agents are not certain when they will be able, or want, to make a transaction, an economic agent will want to hold a certain amount of money at all times in order to have some on hand each time he decides to make a transaction.
It also means holding of money for a certain purpose like: paying salary/wages to the workers, primarily intended to meet expenditures of the company.

===Money under the Means of Exchange Function===

Here, anything that can be used in a transaction can be considered money. This definition is fairly broad, encompassing the money stock, bank deposits, mutual funds, funds deposited in checking accounts, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Face modelling is a fun and skillful way of creating detailed characters. Here is a simple step by step process of starting to create a head model and being able to edit the object on both sides simultaneously. It requires skillful mastery to model a realistic head model with full Materials/Texture Mapping. 

This method is just one of many different techniques for making a head. In this method, we will start with a circle and extrude it to create the head shape, and also apply mirroring so we can make a nice symmetrical head and only do half the work.

Other techniques may be to start with a cube or circle, but most techniques will use the mirroring trick described here.

==Creating the outline==
# Start with an empty space and Switch to side view. ('''NUM3''')
# Add simple circle mesh with 8 vertices (Press '''SPACE'''; select MESH&gt;CIRCLE) Adjust slider to 8.
# Now you are looking at the profile view of a basic 8 vertex circle. Select each vertex and use the [G=Grab] key to spread each vertex carefully to create a Contour outline for the side view of a head. You may also '''WKEY''' &gt; '''Subdivide''' to subdivide each segment to add more vertices for more detail.

Once you have completed your Contour Profile in step 3, we'll turn our two-dimensional circle into 3D.

==Extruding and mirroring==
'''Make sure you set up the mirror correctly before continuing.'''
# Switch to FRONT VIEW ('''NUM1''').
# Deselect all of the circle ('''AKEY'''). Next, press '''EKEY''' to extrude and choose &quot;Only Edges&quot;. Use '''XKEY''' to extrude the circle's contour profile along the X axis.
# Move the mouse to the left a reasonable distance and click to fix the new points. This will create an open-ended prism of your defined face shape.
# Switch to Object mode ('''Tab'''), and select the object.
# Now, use '''ALT'''+'''DKEY''' to duplicate the object as a link. Now any changes you make to the original will affect the duplicate and vice versa.
# With the duplicate still selected, hit '''CTRL'''+'''MKEY''' &gt; '''Z axis''' to flip the duplicate about the Z axis. Now any changes made to one will affect the other in reverse. Thus you have two sides of the head which you can edit at the same time.
# Drag the duplicate so that it is lined up with the original, and their centres are exactly touching (even zoom in very far to make sure of this fact).
# Now model one side of the head until you are happy with it. Even if you apply smoothing, there will be an ugly crease/seam down the centre. Don't worry about this just yet!

(What can you do about this line down the middle...do you weld it at some point? JHS 12/24/2005)
(If you apply the subsurf modifier then weld the inside vertices it goes away. 9/13/2006)

==Modelling the Head==

(THIS AREA MUST BE FILLED) 5-26-08
Pathfind is essential

==Merging the sides and removing the seam==
# Switch into Object mode ('''Tab''') and select both sides of the head
# Join the objects with '''CTRL'''+'''JKEY''' each pair of close vertices and press '''ALT'''+'''MKEY'''-&gt;'''At Center''' to merge them
# To view it in subsurfaced mode, switch into Object mode ('''Tab'''), press '''Add Modifier''' in the buttons window, and select '''Subsurf'''. You can adjust the amount of subsurfacing using the '''Levels''' and '''Render Levels''' sliders. To get rid of the body look of the model, press '''Set Smooth''' in the Links and Materials section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==An Extemp Tournament Step by Step==

===The Draw===

Before every round, you will be with the other extempers in the draw room, usually a library or other large room. This is where you will select your topic. A judge or tournament official sits at the head of the room and calls out speakers at seven minute intervals. (“First speakers, please come draw”, etc.) When your number is called, walk up to the table and draw three questions from the envelope or off the table. Look at all three questions and decide which one you are best prepared to answer. Return the other two and walk back to your table.

===Preparing the Speech===

You have thirty minutes to prepare a speech, beginning from when you were called up to the table. Don't panic! It really is not as bad as it seems. As you walk back to your table, go to the extemp tubs and take out any folders you think might help you answer the question. Return to your speech-writing place and start working. Look over the evidence and familiarize yourself with the topics. Decide how to answer the question and create three points. Add sources to your speech, tie it to your point, and create impacts. Finally, create your intro and conclusion.
Now, you're ready to practice the speech. Find a relatively quiet corner in the prep room and start practicing your speech. Don't worry if you make any mistakes : that's what practice is for. Don't worry about memorizing the speech word-for-word, but do memorize your points, your introduction and conclusion, and your sources, so that you can effectively deliver the speech from memory.

===A Few Prep Tips===

*Many people will tell you that you should spend X number of minutes writing and Y number of minutes preparing your speech. Don't listen to them. When you feel like you're done writing your speech, start to practice it. Develop your own habits that help you.
*Become an “expert” in one or two topic areas, so that you always know you can take a question about those topics. Be familiar, however, with everything, just in case you have to answer a different question.
*NEVER, NEVER, NEVER write out the whole speech. All you need is introduction, three points, support for those points, and conclusion. That provides the most value for every minute of your time.
*Be sure to write out a blank outline on your paper BEFORE the draw. You'd be surprised how much time it saves.
*Get a timer and keep your own prep time. The extemp room manager will announce time at infrequent intervals, but it is always better to always know how much time is remaining.

===Giving the speech===

Before the draw, you'll have checked to see what room you are delivering the speech in. Perhaps you'll have even gone there beforehand so you know where it is. At any rate, when your 30 minutes has expired, walk to the room. Wait outside until the speaker in the room is finished. If you have extra time, continue practicing your speech. When they leave, follow in behind them, leaving your notes outside. As you enter the room, the judge will be finishing the ballot from the last speaker. Walk up to him or her and hand them the question silently. They will confirm your name or speaker code and write the question on your ballot. Ask what kind of time signals they will be giving. Before you start, ask whether or not the judge is ready. When they acknowledge you, start. 
Give your speech. Don't worry about getting phrasings exactly like you had them in practice, the judge will never know. Be sure to make eye contact with the judge and anyone else who may be in the room. Make hand gestures when appropriate to add emphasis to your speech. As you see the one minute remaining signal, wrap up your final point and move into your conclusion. Ideally, your speech will be 6:30, but should be somewhere between 6 and 7 minutes. When your speech is finished, wait for the judge to dismiss you and respond appropriately. Do not say “Thank you for judging” or shake the judge's hand. But do be polite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Structure of an Extemp Speech==

===Introduction===

 
College too expensive? Have kids? Or do you just not have the time?

====Connection====
There are many reasons why Americans today cannot fully complete or receive a college education.

====Question====
So are online degrees as good as on campus degrees?

====Answer====
Most certainly so, yes.

====Preview your points====
Because of convience, cost, and the level of acceptance.

===Point 1 (''Convience'')===

====Present Evidence (stuff from the articles)==== 
If you have a family to feed, and errands to do during some points in your average day, attend college on a campus would be impossible. - USN &amp; WR


====Tie evidence to point====

This is amazing to the America as a whole! A working adult can obtain a college education online from home without interrupting those attendees who have a busy schedule and lifestyle.

====Impact – why is this important?====

===Point 2 (''Cost'')===
	Book costs have gone up 186% between 1986 and 2004. The average cost for a student buying all the textbooks needed for an on-campus education costs $900. Jason Turgeon, a Northeastern University student had to buy a textbook for $160. Overall he paid $500 for several textbooks for his classes. He is receiving an education via an on campus University. However, if young Jason attended an online University, he could go to textbookrevolution.org and download all his textbooks onto his computer or laptop FREE. As for cost of education, enrollment into an accredited online university costs $2540 less than on campus tuition.


An online education greatly reduces the cost for books and materials than that of an on campus education. You wouldn't need to go buy textbooks from a store for a total that could top $1000, you could just go to a legitimate and legal website and download the textbooks for free. Your tuition would be a low cost, and you wouldn't have to pay for room and board.

===Point 3 (''Other nations are ineffective at creating a solution'')===
	Just like pt. 1

===Conclusion===

====Question / Answer====
Repeat them just like in the introduction (''So, when answering the question, Will there ever be peace in the Middle East?, the answer is obviously no.'')

====Repeat Points====
Just like the preview (''Because the Israeli military is too aggressive, there is a lot of antisemitism in the region, and other nations are ineffective at creating a solution.'')

====Tie back to attention getter====
Remind us once again of the opening of the speech and close it off. (''So, the Middle East has become a lot like the playground at recess.  Unfortunately, the kids at recess are a lot more likely to find a solution to their problems, and the Middle East is destined to be a conflict based more on hatred then disagreement.'')

===Speech time===
Maximum 7 minutes, shoot for 6:30

      <text xml:space="preserve">“'''Life''' has many different meanings, as outlined in any dictionary. It is not possible to find one universal definition covering all meanings. The best one can hope for is to find a common denominator for all these different meanings.“

Biology is centered around the phenomenon of life. As it is mostly concerned with the scientific study of life forms, biology does not lend itself to a definition of what life actually is. There are at least as many definitions of life as there are biology text books (of authors that do not simply reproduce what they have read somewhere else before). There is consensus, however, that there is no single property that delineates living from non-living systems. Life seems to rather express itself in a variety of attributes that are common to all living beings.

These commonalities include:

#The exhibition of some kind of order (via a process of self-organization). For some authors this is the most remarkable aspect of life, as the general tendency within the universe is the reduction of order (i.e., an increase degrees of freedom or, physically speaking, entropy). Hence, they characterize life as negentropy - a phenomenon that temporarily and locally counteracts the universal trend of increasing entropy.
#Movement/Growth/Development. That is, existence of a certain nonstationarity of biological systems over time. This includes the finite nature of an individual's existence.
#Reaction/Adaptation. This evolution is another most central aspect of life. Darwinian evolution is, however, not restricted to living beings (e.g., cultural evolution).
#Energy conversion/Metabolism. While this is certainly an important aspect of life (and not directly delineable from point 1), there are some biological organisms (e.g.. virii, viroids, prions that do not show any metabolism. For some authors this is reason enough to declare that a virus is a non-living entity (whose scientific study nonetheless falls into the domain of biology).
#Reproduction. All known life forms (with the disputable exception of prions maybe) are based on a genetic code, with DNA as its material basis. Virus particles also consist of DNA, but are incapable of sustaining a metabolism (and hence reproduction) of their own.

Life is characterized by diversity - a product of its evolution. Thus, &quot;life&quot; is an abstraction of all living phenomena that share a common origin.

[[Image:NCI_bacon.jpg|thumb|right|Fried American bacon.]]
'''Bacon''' is made by brining and cold smoking or drying the sides, back or belly of [[Cookbook:pork|pork]]. There are several kinds of bacon:

Bacons made from the belly:
*American bacon
*English streaky bacon
*Italian bacon ([[Cookbook:pancetta|pancetta]])

Bacons made from the pork butt:
*English gammon

Bacons made from the back:
*Canadian bacon
*English back bacon
*Irish bacon

Bacons made from the back of a hog are much leaner, and do not taste the same as bacons made from the pork belly. Bacon made from the back of the belly are fatter than bacon made from the front of a belly.

Because it is cured, bacon tends to keep for a very long time. 

==American bacon==
American bacon is made by curing the meat in a brine made of sugar, salt, pepper and other assorted spices for at least three days, and then cold smoking &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; it. 

==Pancetta==
Pancetta is made by removing the skin and seasoning the meat with salt, pepper and other spices such as juniper berries, muscot nuts, cloves and cinnamon. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It is cured for two weeks and then rolled up and packed into a skin much like salami. Like many sausages high in fat, pancetta is hard to cut.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Setting up a black and white dark room==

You can easily build an inexpensive darkroom in your own home. You need a room that can block all exterior light and has ventilation (e.g. an exhaust fan).  Having a sink is nice, but not necessary since rinsing can be done out of the darkroom. You should have counter space to hold at least three 11x14 inch trays four if you don't have a sink, an enlarger and room for a paper box and tools. The layout should be a progressive line from the enlarger to the solution trays to the sink.

===Equipment===

; Enlarger : should be as good a manufacturer as you can find. Bargains can be found because many amateur photographers are selling darkroom equipment in favour of digital gear.
; Lens : the focal length of an enlarger lens is a determined by the film format you use. 35mm film requires a 50mm, 120 film a 70mm. Most lenses are now of good quality.  CAD and plastic technology has helped a great deal.  Perfectionists will prefer expensive lenses.  Many are available on the web or at quality used camera stores.
; Timer : any kind of clock will do for this task, but it is important to remember that you must be able to see the hands in the dark. It is still easy to buy a triple timer which will automatically time the duration of each chemical stage.  A clock that integrates safe lights is usually very handy.  check the used camera stores.  
; Exposure monitor : Hard to find, but worth it. An exposure monitor will allow you to gain a ball park exposure for your prints, without needing to make endless teststrips.

===Sealing the darkroom===

If you think you have sealed the darkroom so no outlise light enters, then turn on all possible lights, make sure it is a sunny day, then take a cup of tea into the darkroom and wait for about ten minutes.  Your eyes will adjust to the darkness, and you can see the leaks.  Fix them.  They can fog your negatives and paper.  No Kidding.

==Developing Film==
===Before you start===
In order to start developing film there are several things that you will require:
*Either a darkroom, or any other type of container that seals light (such as a Changing Bag.)
*Chemicals; such as:
-Film developer: (such as D-76, [HC 110,] Fixer, Photo Flo)
-Paper developer: (such as Kodak Dektol, Stopbath, Fixer)
*Scissors
*Cartridge opener for 35 mm film, you do not use plastic screw-in cartridges. (Such as the ones you buy with film loaded in them.)
*Light-Tight Tank
*Film Reels
*A Drying Rack or Printer Dryers.
*A film squeegee to takes drops of water off the film. (Optional, drying rack is good enough.)

If you have everything you need, start by checking that your solutions &amp; water are room temperature.

Water temperature is an issue.  Variations in temperature will change the speed of chemical actions on film.   A five minute development at 68 degrees (F) will be very different from a 72  or 62 degrees development.  There are expensive water temperature meters that can be installed that will automatically keep the water temperature steady.  Otherwise you will have to be alert to temperature changes and manage as best you can.

What you could do is make a revolving chart for your different room temperatures to see how long your development time will be.

===Loading the film into the tank===
Start by setting the equipment and solutions for development at the ready in your darkroom.  Try to keep them in a predictable place and order so you use the right stuff at the right time. Place the parts of the developing tank in good order so you can find them in the dark.  Once the cartridge is open, you cannot turn on any standard or safe lights until the film is once again in a lightproof container (hopefully the development tank).  You might want to take a test drive with some test strips.  Take your scissors and cut the curved part of the film. Be careful not to cut too much, because that might spoil the negatives later on, won't fit into your camera, or is just a waste of, what could be, a good picture.

Afterwards, roll the film using the reel. It is a bit hard to explain how to do this in words, but after you do it several times you will understand it.  Again, practice in the light with some Practice Film.

Then, when the film is rolled on the reel, put the reel on the pole, put the pole in the tank, put the seal on the top of the tank and close the tank using the cap provided with the tank.  You can turn the lights on now.

Once you have done this, you may proceed to the next step.

===Developing Film===
Developing needs to be standardized.  Your time starts when you start pouring in the developer. If you find the results are okay - them keep up your standards.  If a bit underdeveloped add time, if overdeveloped, use less time than recommended.  Again - this is assuming you have temperature control.

*Comments: &quot;For one, you can't change the development time because, A.) You don't know how your film is gonna look UNTIL you're FINISHED. Unless, you wanna ruin your film by opening the tank then, sure. B.) The time isn't always going to be the same, again, depending on the temperature. C.) Under exposing or over exposing doesn't always depend on the time or temperature, it could be your camera, OR just YOU.&quot; - Victoria, 16 &amp; Raquel, 16.

Begin by pouring clean water of 68 degrees, into the tank.  This softens the emulsion and prepares for a more uniform acceptance of the developer.  Put the lid on the tank and then invert it several times.  Discard the water.  Try and get as much out as possible.

*Comments: &quot;For one, it's NOT ALWAYS gonna be 68 degrees. Two, the water has nothing to do with 'softening the emulsion &amp; preparation for a more 'uniform acceptance''. You use water between D-76 &amp; Stop-Bath to be sure all the chemicals are washed off, completely. NEVER use water AFTER Photo Flo. Photo Flo is used to wash off the residues from the chemicals. Using water after Photo Flo will totally defeat the purpose of even using Photo Flo in the first place. Three, Invert ?? It's called 'Agitate'.&quot; - Victoria, 16 &amp; Raquel, 16.

Set your clock or watch your watch for a beginning time, and pour the developer into the tank.  Invert the tank according to the film manufacturer's instructions or to your standardization.  Too much agitation will retard development,  to little will create different intensities of development in different areas of the film.  So you are looking for uniformity without interrupting the development process too much.  The development time is usually suggested by the film maker's recommendation for particular developers.  Look to the developer paperwork, the film paper work, or go onto the film or developer maker's web sites.  At the end of the development period discard the developer.  Many people retain the developer and you can certainly reuse what you have, but the depletion of its chemical action can happen quickly and steadily - making it more difficult to establish your own development standards.  The choice is yours, or our economic concerns.

*Comments: &quot;Developer ? There's multiple developers. Be specific. The first developer for developing film is, D-76. Invert=AGITATE. GET IT RIGHT. No, just because they're Manufacturer's doesn't mean they're always right on the instructions. You can never be too sure. Go with the gut, go with what you KNOW. Just.. Listen to Mr. Woodard. Good job, you put agitation. Surprised you didn't put invertation. It'll make my film retarded ?? O.o WRONG. It will SLOW DOWN development. No, it's not depended on the film maker's recommendations on how long you should develop. It's based on the TEMPERATURE. Don't go anywhere online, look up everything in a Photography book. Such as, Guide to Photography. NEVER DISCARD YOUR DEVELOPERS. YOU CAN RE-USE THEM UNTIL THEY GO BAD. POUR THEM INTO A JUG OR SOMETHING ! DEVELOPERS ARE EXPENSIVE. If chemicals are ever weak, double the development time. When D-76 is weak, it turns black/dark. Stop-Bath turns into a red/purple color when weak. Dektol turns black, as well.&quot; - Victoria, 16 &amp; Raquel, 16.

This process alters the film emulsion and the chemical interact with the silver in the black and white film.  Your waste will contain metal and should be disposed of properly.

*Comments: &quot;Wow, surprisingly you got that correct. Congratulations.&quot; - Victoria, 16 &amp; Raquel, 16.

After emptying the tank quickly pour in stop-bath.  This will stop most of the development and should be done as quickly as possible to help standardize your development time.  The stop bath is usually about 30 seconds.  discard or retain the stop and pour in the fixer.  This finalizes the development and stabilizes (fixes) the negatives so they will be viewable in light and preserved.  Empty the tank of fixer and wash the film.  I usually open the tank and place it under the faucet.  Temperature is not as critical here, but keeping a 68 degree discipline is always a good idea.

*Comments: &quot;One, you don't use Stop-Bath for developing film. That's for making a print. You use Fixer for your second chemical in this process. YOU DON'T USE STOP-BATH AND FIXER ?!?! WANNA RUIN YOUR FILM ?! No, DON'T USE STOP-BATH WHEN DEVELOPING FILM. Why do you think it &quot;fixes&quot; ? BECAUSE YOU USE FIXER ! Fixer fixes &amp; Stop-Bath stops !! NEVER open your tank after FIXER. YOU ONLY OPEN IT AFTER YOU HAVE PROPERLY USED PHOTO FLO !! Temperature is EVERYTHING.&quot; - Victoria, 16 &amp; Raquel, 16.

===Drying the film===

Once the film is cleaned, hang (clips are available at better camera stores) it on a line in a still, dust proof area (hopefully your darkroom is sealed tight so it is a good place to dry film.  If you use a bathroom for drying - close the door, turn off the exhaust fan, and try to keep people out for a while.  Place a clip on the bottom of the roll to keep some tension on the film so it does not dry in a twisted form.  When sufficiently dry - go away and let it dry some more.

Once it is really dry, cut the film into strips that can be placed into plastic sleeves designed for the purpose.  You now have a finished negative  in a well protected negative sleeve.

You may wish to begin a catalog of negatives.  If you take a lot of pictures, you will quickly be frustrated by a messy collection.  Use names, dates, key pictures, or events like &quot;the local town fair&quot; to help you retrieve the negatives you want.   Keeping the contact sheet sleeves in an album helps.

==Making Contact Sheets==

If you have full page plastic sleeves, you entire roll is probably in one plastic sleeve.  Keep the negatives in the sleeve - less handling means fewer fingerprints or damages.  

You will need to do a couple of test strips until you know how much time at what f stop on the lens produces a good exposure for development.  If you do not have a meter (see above) then the next best method is test-strips.  As follows:

Run your enlarger up the support to a high level.  Turn on your enlarger, open the lens to its most open position and focus the lens to the base of the enlarger.  The edge of the frame will sharpen when you are in focus.  You may wish to use an easel or place duct tape on the base in the outline of a piece of paper.  You want to be able to put the photo paper and the sleeve of negatives in a standard place to assure complete exposure of the negatives.  

Turn off all lights, put a fresh 8 x 10 sheet of photo paper on the base or easel, and then place the negatives on the paper.  Put a plate of clean glass on top of the negtives to assure flatness.  

To make a test strip place a thick piece of cardboard larger than 8 x 10 or some other material to block all the light.  Turn on your time clock for one minute.  Stop down the lens to a low setting smaller f/stop = higher number = less light).  At standard intervals - say 10 seconds - move the cardboard about an inch.  You may  get six or so strips.  After the complete page is exposed - place the cardboard over the whole page and turn off your enlarger.  You can then begin to develop the photo paper. (See below)  What will eventually happen is that you will find one of these strips to do a pretty good job of reproducing the photo you took.  That &quot;strip&quot; will be your time exposure.  If it were the fourth strip - then you would expose the negatives at 40 seconds at that f/stop, and you can now redo the above without having to make a strip sheet and develop the full sheet for a true contact sheet.  Test over.  If the strip is too dark - either change the f/stop to a smaller aperture or reduce the time exposure.  If it is too light, add time or open up the lens to let out more light.   Use 5 sceond increments - 20 - or whatever it takes to get you to a standard with which you are comfortable.  Keep adjusting until you get some good exposures.

If you take standard negatives, develop the strips the same way, and keep a good eye on your temperatures and times, you can just go ahead and assume your time and exposure settings are okay and you won't have to do a test strip anymore.  

==Making Prints==
Print making is the fun part.  Using a handy can of air - make sure there is no dust on the negative or the lens of the enlarger.  Place a negative in the negative carrier and place it in the enlarger.  Focus the print on the easel of base (focus scopes are great here for focusing.  You adjust the lens focus until you can see the grain of the negative on the easel). After reading your exposure or making a test strip of a single negative, you have the proper f/stop and exposure time for this one negative.  I usually try to have at least 30 seconds for exposure so I can dodge or burn.  A quick exposure does not give you time to improve the print.  If you need more time, stop down the lens.  One change down will double the exposure time.  

(You will probably want to do a test strip on each negative.  Sacrificing a piece of paper for a test strip will save you many sheets of 8x10's.)

My timer turns on the enlarger and turns off the safe light. Then when the timer stops, it turns the safe light back on.  (I do not have any lights on when I open up my box of photo paper.)  [If you find your safe lights cause fog in your print, do not turn them on until the development process is well along.]  Take your test contact sheet print, turn on the timer and immerse the print in the developer solution  - which should be the first tray to the right of the enlarger.  Gently agitate the print by tapping it with the side of your developer tongs so it keeps getting exposed to good chemicals for a well distributed process.  You should begin to see the print emerge.  After the end of the recommended development time for that developer, paper and temperature, lift the print out and let developer drip off the paper. Place it in the stop bath - the second tray to the right of the enlarger.  After that time is up, lift the paper, let it drip into the stop bath and place the paper into the fixer - the third tray to the right of the enlarger.  After the recommended fixing time, place the paper in the wash bath with running water at about 68 degrees, and let it wash for a long time.  You can turn on standard lights after the fixing is done.  

Making a print is the same process as the test strip - but without making strips.  Depending on the paper you buy, you can further adjust the print by altering the contrast of the paper, using different paper, different developers, adding toners, etc.

When I process, I use 5 trays.  One developer, one stop bath, two fixers and a toner bath - usually selenium toner with photoflo.  Portraits can be enhanced by sepia toner as well.  Then I go to the wash.  A plastic washer is a good purchase.  They can hold a few prints, will hook up to your faucet, and agitate the prints while they are washing.  a squeege helps limit water spots on the paper.  

After a thorough washing, place the prints on a drying surface.  They will curl and stuff, but heat mounting them will straighten them out.  You can back them to savage board with wax paper that does a great mounting job.  I used to back the prints with a sheet of like kind photo paper - that makes it more archival and less prone to damage by age - but paper prices are kind of steep now.  The number one enemy of photos is sulphur.  Those yellow stains in old photos are probably sulfur - which comes from wood frames or impure backing material.  Good luck.

When designing your robot there are plenty of programs to help. Ranging from a simple tool to print wheel encoders, through CAD drawing programs up to mechanical simulation programs.

== 2D CAD==

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Autocad2000.png|none|thumb|288px|&lt;center&gt;Autocad 2000&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;

e.g. AutoCAD. This type of software is used to turn a rough sketch into a nice professional drawing. This type of drawing is standardized for readability. (Meaning every different type of line has a particular meaning. Solid lines are visible edges, dashed lines are hidden edges, line-dash-line lines are center lines. Standards also include methods of dimensioning and types of views presented in a drawing.) Of course you're free to use your own standards, but using an industrial standard, such as ANSI or ISO,  makes it easier to share your plans with other people around the world. While it may somewhat more tedious to make a drawing using 2D software, the results are generally better than using 3D solid modeling software. Solid modelers still have problems translating 3D models into 2D drawings and adding proper notation to standards.

*Freeware CAD software: [http://www.cadstd.com/ CADstd]
*Professional CAD software: [http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=2704278 AutoCAD]

*GPL CAD software: [http://www.ribbonsoft.com/qcad.html QCad] [[Wikipedia:QCad]]
* GPL vector drawing software: [[Inkscape]] [[Wikipedia:Inkscape]]

==Solid Modeling==
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:Inventor 5.3 drawing.png|&lt;center&gt;Inventor 5.3 Drawing a Schematic on a part&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

e.g. SolidWorks or [[Pro_Engineer | Pro/Engineer]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Pro_Engineer Pro/Engineer] ([[Wikipedia:Pro/ENGINEER]]).
A newer way to draw parts and machines. With solid modeling you &quot;build&quot; the parts in 3D, put them together in an assembly and then let the software generate the 2D drawings (sounds harder than it is).  The major advantage over 2D CAD programs is you can see the complete part/machine without actually building it in real life. Mistakes are easily found and corrected in the model. These 3D models are not yet completely standardized though there is a standard for digital data. At this time the 2D drawings this software generates do not conform completely to industrial standards. The 2D paper drawing is still the communication tool of preference in industry and clarity of intent is very important. Solid modeling software tend to generate overly complex drawing views with overly simplified dimensioning methods that likely do not correctly convey the fit, form or function of the part or assembly.

==Pneumatic &amp; Hydraulic Simulation==
[http://www.festo.com Festo] has a demo version of both a pneumatic and a hydraulic simulation program. Look for FluidSIM Pneumatiek and FluidSIM Hydraulica. (Pick country; click on industrial automatisation; and use the search field to the right.)&lt;BR&gt;
Limitations: Can't save nor print. Most of the didactic material isn't included.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Software to draw electronics schematics and designing Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). These packages contain software to draw the schematic, libraries with symbols, and software to draw the PCBs (with autorouter).

In no particular order:

*Freeware: [http://www.cadsoft.de/ Eagle] is commonly used by beginners for their projects because a limited version is available for free.  The toolset is well integrated and has a large hobbiest user base.  However, once you progress beyond basic designs, you need to pay for the full version.

*Open Source: The open-source [http://geda.seul.org/ gEDA Project] has produced a mature suite of applications for electronics design, including: a schematic capture program, attribute manager, netlister supporting over 20 netlist formats, analog and digital simulation, PCB layout with autorouter, and Gerber viewer.  The project was started in 1997 to write EDA tools useful for personal robotics projects, but as of this writing the tools are also used by hobbiests, students, educators, and professionals for many different design tasks.  The suite runs best on Linux and OSX, although Windows ports of some apps have been made.

* Open Source: [[Kicad]], [[wikipedia: Kicad]] includes schematic capture and PCB layout

*Open Source: [http://www.freepcb.com/ Free PCB] is a mature Windows only open source PCB drafting tool.

==µControllers==

===Programming Languages===

There are many different programming languages available for µControllers:
*Assembly: Every µcontroller can be programmed in Assembly. However the differences between µcontrollers can be huge. Assembly gives you the most power of the µcontroller but this power comes with a price: Hard to learn and (almost)no code reuse.&lt;BR&gt; Assembly code is in essence translated machine code. It provides only the instruction set of the processor: add, subtract, &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt; multiply, move data between registers and/or memory, conditional jumps. No loops, complex selection or build in I/O as in C/C++, Basic, Pascal, ...&lt;BR&gt; The disadvantage is that you have to implement everything yourself (lots of work even for the most simple programs).&lt;BR&gt; The advantage is that you have to implement everything yourself (programs can be written extremely efficient both in speed and size).&lt;BR&gt;This language is intended for advanced users and is usually only used as an optimisation for code in tight loops or for pushing the performance of a limited device to the edge of its abilities.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Reasons to learn it: 
**Teaches you how the computer works on its lowest level.
**Provides high speed code which consumes little memory.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Reasons to avoid it:
**Limited use.
**Non-portable.
**very hard to master.&lt;br&gt;Freeware: [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2725 AVR]

*C: C offers power but is much more portable than Assembly. For most µcontrollers there is a C compiler available. The differences between µcontrollers is smaller here, except for using hardware.&lt;BR&gt; Learning C is much easier than learning Assembly, still C isn't an easy language to learn from scratch. However these days there are very good books available on this subject.
**Freeware:[http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?module=FreaksTools&amp;func=viewItem&amp;item_type=tool&amp;item_id=560 GCC Tools for AVR Studio Software]

*Basic: For many µcontrollers there are special flavours of Basic available. This is the easiest and fastest way to code µcontrollers, however you'll have to sacrifice some power. Still modern basic compilers can produce very impressive code.
**Limited Freeware/payware:[http://www.mcselec.com/bascom-avr.htm Bascom AVR] Very good Basic compiler for AVR. Limited to 4Kb programs. There is also a version available for the 8051 µcontrollers.
**Limited Freeware/payware:[http://www.xcprod.com/titan/XCSB/download.html XCSB] PIC Basic compiler. Lite version. No 32-bit integer and floating point support. (OS/2 WARP, Win95, Win98, Win2K, XP and Linux)
*Forth:   
**[http://wiki.forthfreak.net/index.cgi?PFAVR PFAVR] (GPL) Needs external RAM.
**[http://wiki.forthfreak.net/index.cgi?ByteForth ByteForth] Dutch and works without external RAM, there is also a building book (Dutch only for now) available for Ushi our robotic project.

===Programmers===
After you've written your program, you need to get it into your µcontroller. If you use C or Basic you'll have to compile it. Then use a programmer to upload the code into the µcontroller. There are several different methods for this last step.
*External programmers: This is a device that's connected to a PC. You'll plug the µcontroller IC, EEPROM or other memory IC in its socket and let the PC upload the code. Afterwards you plug the IC in its circuit and test it. Can be time consuming when updating your program after debugging.
*ISP In System Programming: The board with the µcontroller has a special connector to connect to a PC. Hook up the cable, download code, test and repeat. More modern method. Only disadvantage: it consumes some boardspace. Not all µcontrollers support this.
*[[Wikiversity:Embedded_System_Engineering#bootloaders|Bootloader]], also called &quot;self-programming&quot;: The CPU accepts a new program through any available connection to a PC (no special connector needed), then programs itself. Not all µcontrollers support this. And you also need some other programming method, to get the initial bootloader programmed in (telling it exactly which connector to watch for a new program, the baud rate, etc.).

===Debuggers===
Modern µcontrollers have on-chip debug hardware called [[:w:JTAG]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Classical Quantity Theory of Money==

===History===

This theory was described comprehensively by Irving Fisher (1911), in the book ''The Purchasing Power of Money''. It is the classical view of how money is used in the economy, and what variables it affects.

===Fisher's Model===

Consider a closed economy. In every transaction, the value of sales and the value of purchases must match. Therefore, even when scaled up to the aggregate level, the value of payments must equal the value of receipts.


&lt;math&gt;P_t \equiv R&lt;/math&gt;


But &lt;math&gt;P_t&lt;/math&gt;, the value of payments, must be equal to the number of transactions multiplied by the average price they take place at. &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the value of receipts, must be equal to the amount of money in the economy multipled by the average number of times it circulates (or, the ''velocity'' of money).

This gives us an identity:


&lt;math&gt; PT \equiv M_sV_T &lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is simply the price level and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of transactions.  &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt; is the supply of money in the economy, and &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt; is termed the velocity of transaction.

===An Evaluation===

====Inflation====

Consider now the behaviour of these variables in the real world. The money supply is of course exogenously determined (by the government / central bank). We can assume that in equilibrium the market clears and therefore the supply of money &lt;math&gt;M_s&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the demand for money &lt;math&gt;M_d&lt;/math&gt;.

Fisher further assumed that the volume of transactions &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; would be relatively stable at long run equilibrium, and that the velocity of money &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt; would also be invariant in the short run. This would then give us the following equation:


&lt;math&gt;M_dV_T = PT \,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;P = {M_dV_T \over T}&lt;/math&gt;


It can be seen that any change to the price level is wholly induced by changes to the exogenous variables. If we consider &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; invariant over the short run, the rate of change in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is entirely due to the rate of change in &lt;math&gt;M_d&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the rate of inflation in the economy is entirely due to changes in the money supply. The equilibriating mechanism is the change in money demand.

====The Neutrality of Money====

Consider the basic equation of the model.


&lt;math&gt;M_dV_T = PT \,&lt;/math&gt;


We then have:


&lt;math&gt;{M_d \over P} = {T \over V_T}&lt;/math&gt;


If the Fisherian quantity theory is correct, then any change in &lt;math&gt;M_d&lt;/math&gt; would lead to a corresponding change in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, while the real variables, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt;, remain unchanged. This is known as the neutrality of money, a condition whereby changes to the money supply affect only nominal variables. A related, and harder condition to satisfy, is the superneutrality of money, where changes in the rate of growth of the nominal money supply influence only the rate of inflation, and the rate of depreciation of the currency in an open economy. There is no effect on any other variable.

==Marshall, Pigou and Keynes - Developments of the Classical Theory==

===History===

This preliminary version of the quantity theory was developed by Marshall and Pigou (1917) in order to extend the analysis to consider short run fluctuations in the velocity of money. In Fisherian quantity theory the velocity of money was determined exogenously.

===A change in viewpoint===

Under the Fisherian analysis an individual holds as much money as he ''needs'' in order to carry out transactions. Marshall and Pigou approached the problem slightly differently. Their version of the quantity theory determines how much money an individual ''chooses'' to hold in order to carry out transactions.

The explicit assumptions here are that the individual cannot hold more money than his stock of wealth, that he makes a choice between money, which does not pay interest income, and bonds, which do. The demand for money function therefore varies with the interest rate, the level of wealth, and the volume of transactions that said individual wishes to carry out.

The model proposed by Marshall and Pigou was simplified by assuming that the volume of transactions would be stable in the short run. This allowed the aggregate real money demand function to be equated to some proportion of the level of real income in the economy. We thus have:


&lt;math&gt;{M_d \over P} = kY&lt;/math&gt;


Rearranging:

&lt;math&gt;M_d = kPY \,&lt;/math&gt;


And:


&lt;math&gt;\left ( M_d \right ) \left ( \frac{1}{k} \right ) = PY&lt;/math&gt;


Here, the constant &lt;math&gt;k^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''income velocity'' of money, as opposed to &lt;math&gt;V_T \,&lt;/math&gt; in the Fisherian analysis, which was the ''transactions velocity of money''.

===Keynesian analysis - the introduction of the interest rate===

Keynes' contribution to the above analysis focused on defining more clearly the motives economic agents had in holding money. He defined 3 motives for holding money - the transactions motive (where agents hold money in order to make planned payments), the precautionary motive (where agents hold money against the unforeseen need to make payments) and the speculative motive (where agents make the decision to hold money according to the opportunity cost of doing so).

The speculative motive can be explained more clearly by considering the asset allocation decision between money and bonds. We defined bonds earlier as any asset that pays an income. The rate of this income is, quite clearly, the interest rate. If the interest rate is expected to fall, the price of bonds will rise, and if the interest rate is expected to rise, the price of bonds will fall.

Keynes extended the analysis by assuming that there is a range of interest rates that is considered to be the mean range, and that the interest rate would be mean-reverting towards it.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Oldbull210008. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Oldbull210008~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

__NOTOC__
'''Frappé coffee''' is a refreshing drink of Greek origin, perfect on a summer's day.

== Ingredients ==
*1-2 spoons of instant coffee
*Tall Glass of Cold Water
*1-3 spoons of sugar (optional)
*3-5 ice cubes (optional)
*Milk (optional; condensed/evaporated milk works best)

== Procedure ==
*Put coffee and sugar in a shaker or tall glass and add a little water, just enough to cover the mixture (about 10 ml, or a couple of teaspoonfuls). 
*Shake or stir with mixer until the mixture becomes foamy.  
*Fill the glass with cold water.  
*Add ice cubes, milk (preferably evaporated or condensed milk) or cream to taste. 
*Sip with a straw.
===Variant===
Instead of shaking the initial coffee/sugar/water mix, it can also be beaten with a teaspoon.  This needs patience because takes a while to form the mix into a stiff, thick, thoroughly aerated, light brown mousse with a texture like meringue.  The advantage of this more troublesome method is that the foam produced when the rest of the water is added is richer and lasts longer.  This foam can also withstand hot water, and produce an effect akin to espresso crema.

== Types ==

* Ratio of Sugar to Coffee &gt;2/1: Frappé ''glykós''  (sweet)
* Ratio of Sugar to Coffee  1/1: Frappé ''métrios'' (medium)
* No sugar: Frappé ''skétos'' (plain)
Any of the above with milk added: ''mé gála'' (with milk),  e.g. ''Frappé glykós me gala'' or ''frappógalo''

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* You can also add Baileys or a ball of ice cream.
* Once I was in Greece I was told that the right order of mixing Frappe after making foam is ICE, MILK and than fill up the glass with  cold WATER.
* By including the ICE when shaking or stirring the coffee, it allows the foam to become more aerated and frothier. Once this has been done, you can then top up with water and/or milk.

{{Wikipedia|Knoppix}}
'''Knowing Knoppix''' is a guide to the Knoppix Linux distro for the complete beginner'''

Knoppix is an astoundingly clever product. It runs Linux completely from a CD or DVD. There is no need to install. It bypasses all the software already installed on your PC or laptop and automatically detects the hardware in your computer (subject to suitable hardware). When you've finished using Knoppix, simply restart. Your computer will return to your regular system, and it will behave as if nothing has happened. Knoppix is Free Software and open source under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).

This beginner-friendly book is designed to help with these situations:
* You can't start Windows! Disaster? Possibly not. It is often possible to rescue files using Knoppix from crashed Windows computers, even when Windows cannot be started. This guide takes you step by step through the process.
* You are curious about Linux, and you want to discover what all the fuss is about.
* You want a useful guide to help you get started with Knoppix.

[[File:Ja_da_ya.png|right|thumb|320px|A map of Japanese copula.]]
Many learners of Japanese begin their studies thinking that the language is a single standard, spoken across the whole nation. While it is true that nearly all Japanese nationals can speak the standard language, it is by no means their every day language. This long and mountainous archipelago has over the centuries given rise to a great number of dialects with their own distict accent, intonation and vocabulary.

Before the Tokugawa Shogun moved to Edo (modern day Tokyo) in 1603, the main place of government was Kyoto, and standard Japanese was the ancestor of today's Kyoto dialect. Modern standard Japanese, hyōjungo (標準語) is basically the dialect of Tokyo. This is used in schools and media throughout the country.&lt;!-- Anyone know if local stations have local dialects? --&gt;
Other varieties of Japanese are often considered provincial and like in every language, each bears connotations of archtypes.

: Good idea! If you intend to do so, please have a look at recent conversions, like [[How To Build A Computer]], and the advice giving there: [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]]. Be careful not to split it up too much, a couple of sections would be fine. Also, have a look at the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:07, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::It's so much text to scroll through to get to something that you could be looking for. This '''MUST''' be split into multiple sections. Updating and syncing can still happan if it is split. Smaller pages might even make your job easier. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 22:03, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

I have tagged this for a transwiki to [[Wikisource:Main Page|Wikisource]]. Wikisource is a sister project of Wikibooks for source texts, which are books you copy from outside. See [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]].

: I'm sure this book wasn't intended to be part of wikisource. It's more a textbook than most of the stuff here. Besides, it has been edited a bit since it was dumped here(mostly by me). I think it would be better to rename it as a KDE textbook or something. --[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 20:19, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

I have pages on wikipedia and wiktionary, but I'm winging away from editing -pedia cos there's nothing I can do to it thats worthwhile anymore (Cleanup isnt really my style - I much prefer adding and adding more stuff). And I decided rashly to stop Witionary too, so I'm gonna give books a shot. My speciality is French, so I'm gonna see what I can do about the [[French]] book here.

# Add links releated sections of Wikibooks


I don't know much about ecology (hence me reading this wikibook) but this first chapter does not give me much confidence in what I'm reading, since it mainly appears to be quoting a text from 1961.

Im new to this site but my class is using it as an educational tool. I am excited to see if this type of teaching will be more effective then just reading out of a textbook.--[[User:JDrynan|JDrynan]] 20:11, 22 August 2007 (UTC)


I am also curious to see how much we learn from it, but it will be hard at first, I like the old fashioned textbooks.--[[User:Slevadney|Slevadney]] 00:29, 23 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe|Pho ga}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Cuisine of Vietnam]]

'''Pho Ga''' is one of the culinary gems of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnamese cuisine]], available within a mile radius of almost every person in the community of Little Saigon, a Vietnamese enclave located in Orange County, California. Although the flavors are complex, the technique is simple, and the result is delectable.  

== Ingredients ==
* &quot;Pho&quot; noodles*

=== Broth ===
* 1 small to medium [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] (whole)
* 12 cups chicken broth
* 3-4 slices of fresh [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (whole)
* 1 medium brown [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], peeled (whole)
* 1 tbsp of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] or more (to taste)
* Fish sauce, to taste*

===Seasoning Pouch===
* 1 tsp. fennel seed
* 1 tsp. peppercorns
* 3 whole star anise*
* 1-2 dried cardamom pods*
* 1/2 stick cinnamon
* 3 whole cloves

===Finishing Touches===

* Diced cilantro and green onion
* A few fresh basil leaves, torn
* Fresh bean sprouts
* Thinly sliced brown or white onion (several pieces per serving)
* Hoisin Sauce (1 tsp per serving, or to taste)*
* Lime (squeezed into broth before eating)
* Jalapeños, serranos, or other chilli peppers
* Sriracha or similar chilli sauce
* Additional fish sauce

'''Note:''' All ingredients, particularly those marked with asterisks, can be found in Asian markets and some large supermarkets

== Procedure ==
# Combine ingredients for seasoning pouch  in a small strainer or a pouch made from cheesecloth and twine.
# In a large stock pot, boil broth ingredients together with seasoning pouch until the chicken is thoroughly cooked
# Remove the chicken and strain broth back into the pot for additional simmering. Once the chicken is cool, pull apart the meat into bite sized pieces and discard bones.
# In a separate pot, boil the &quot;Pho&quot; noodles in sufficient water. Stop when they're no longer chewy (basically the way you'd boil spaghetti). Make sure you don't overdo it or the noodles will fall apart and you'll end up with porridge. When done, pour the noodles into a colander and rinse them with lukewarm water. Then, leave them to drain.  
# Once the noodles have drained, add them to a bowl. Combine the chicken, &quot;finishing touches&quot; (see above), and enough broth to cover the noodles.  Enjoy with fork (chopsticks if you want the authentic experience) and a spoon.

The study of Radiation Physics can be divided into three parts:
*Radiation Physics, which is a pure science dealing with the nature of radiation and its interactions with matter.
*Radiotherapeutic (Medical) Physics, which is an applied science dealing with the use of radiation within the Radiation Oncology department where humans (and sometimes animals) are treated
*Health Physics, which is also an applied science dealing with radiation safety, both in Radiation Oncology departments, but also in research labs, at nuclear power plants, etc.

XBLite is an offshoot of the [[XBasic]] programming language. The XBLite compiler translates programs from source form into assembly language. From this point, conventional tools build the final executable program or DLL library. The XBLite compiler will work on all Windows platforms including Win98, NT, 2000, and XP.

XBLite is a &quot;younger brother&quot; of XBasic. XBasic was developed by Max Reason to be used under MS-Windows and LINUX OSs. In 2000, he made the entire language, compiler, and PDE freely available under an Open Source GPL. The XBasic language itself has not been altered so console programs in XBasic will run identically under XBLite. The XBLite compiler is also released under the same OpenSource GPL license.

==Enhancements, post XBasic==
XBLite has been enhanced for use under Windows. It is now possible to:
# Create true command line Win32 console programs.
# Use the windows common controls for creating GUI applications.
# Easily add resources to your executable program.
# Use inline assembly language in your program.
# Modify and extend the XBasic language.
And, all of the windows common controls and common dialogs are now available to create win32 native graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

== &quot;Hello World!&quot; in XBLite ==
A common example of the language's syntax is the &quot;Hello World&quot; program:

=== A console version ===
 IMPORT  &quot;xst&quot;	 ' Standard library : required by most programs
 DECLARE FUNCTION Entry ()
 
 FUNCTION Entry ()
  PRINT &quot;Hello World!&quot;
  a$ = INLINE$ (&quot;Press Enter to quit &gt;&quot;)
 END FUNCTION
 END PROGRAM

=== A GUI version ===
 IMPORT &quot;gdi32&quot;             ' import a system library
 IMPORT &quot;user32&quot;            ' import a system library
 DECLARE FUNCTION Entry ()  ' declare function Entry()
 
 FUNCTION Entry ()          ' begin function                           
  ' display a message box  
  MessageBoxA (0, &amp;&quot;Hello World!&quot;, &amp;&quot;Hello World Window&quot;, $$MB_OK)
 END FUNCTION               ' end function
 END PROGRAM                ' end program

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello there. I'm new to Wiki and all that, but after finding Wikipedia and looking around I'm loving it.


At the moment? Well, I'm working on a rather large body of work which will hopefully be a complete IB Economics textbook for this site. I am halfway through my first year, so it's going to be a long and arduous process. Kind of the like the IB.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Jakob. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Jakob~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">who is this Proffessor James Rachels? The critisisms atributed to him are as far as I am aware as old as utilitarianism it'self and perhaps even older. Foolip, I am glad somebody else is on the case, I have done some work with historical utilitarianism, but am not so good on the modern side.

----

I applaud the work done on this wikibook, but find the quality of the section on utilitarianism to be unsatisfactory. I write this as notes to myself, so that I shall be able to come back at a later time and make improvements.
*History of Utilitarianism (Bentham, Mill, Sidgwick).
*Different types of utilitarianism: hedonistic and preference utilitarianism
*Utilitarianism and equality (Singer's equal consideration of interests)
*Utilitarianism today (mainly Peter Singer)
*Other critiques of utilitarianism (and counter-claims!)

Present Subjuntivo '''(O presente do subjuntivo)''' is used to show that some idea or action is hypothetical. It is also used to express desire, emotion, improbability, give commands, and in impersonal expressions to express opinion (i.e. É bom que '''ele seja'''.)

'''Example:''' Eu quero '''que tu''' me '''tragas''' um garfo. -&gt; I want you to bring me a fork.

== Forming ==
''Presente do Conjuntivo'' is formed from the '''singular first person of Presente do Indicativo's radical''', plus the following desinencies:

== Separation Axioms for Topological Spaces ==
{{TOC right}}

A topology on a space is a collection of subsets called ''open''. We can then ask questions such as &quot;can we separate any two distinct points in the space by enclosing them in two disjoint open sets?&quot; For the real line with its usual topology, the answer is obviously yes, but there are spaces for which this is not so. It turns out that many properties of continous maps one could take for granted depend, in fact, on one of the conditions stated below holding. Topological spaces are classified according to which such conditions, called ''separation axioms'', happen to hold.

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space, and let ''x,y'' be any two distinct points in that space. The following conditions, ordered from least to most restrictive, are ones we may wish to place on &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{T})&lt;/math&gt;:

; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : For every ''x, y'', there exists an open set ''O'' that contains one point of the pair, but not the other.

; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : For every ''x, y'', there exist open sets &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; contains ''x'' but not ''y'' and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; contains ''y'' but not ''x''.

; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : For every ''x, y'', there exist ''disjoint open sets'' &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; contains ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; contains ''y''.  &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; spaces are also called '''Hausdorff''' spaces.

; ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2½&lt;/sub&gt; : For every ''x, y'', there exist ''disjoint closed neighborhoods'' &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; of ''x'' and ''y'' respectively.

; '''regular''' : If ''C'' is a closed set, and ''z'' is a point not in ''C'', there exist disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; contains ''C'' and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; contains ''z''. A topological space that is both regular and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

; '''completely regular''' : If ''C'' is a closed set, and ''z'' is a point not in ''C'', there exists a ''continuous function'' &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that ''f''(''z'')=0 and for any &lt;math&gt;w\in C&lt;/math&gt;, we have ''f''(''w'')=1 (i.e. ''f''(''C'')={1}). A topological space that is both completely regular and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3½&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

; '''normal''' : If &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are ''disjoint closed sets'', there exist disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space that is both normal and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

; '''completely normal''' : Let &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; be ''separated sets'', meaning that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)\cap B=A\cap\mathrm{Cl}(B)=\O&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exist disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space that is both completely normal and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

; '''perfectly normal''' : If &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint closed sets, there exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{0\})=C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{1\})=C_2&lt;/math&gt;. A topological space that is both perfectly normal and &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

NOTE: Many authors treat regular, completely regular, normal, completely normal, and perfectly normal spaces as synonyms for the corresponding ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' property.

==Relations among the Separation Properties==
The ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' separation properties (axioms) form a hierarchy, such that if ''i&gt;j'', then property  ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' implies property  ''T&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. When property ''T&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' implies ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', which in turn implies ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' was proposed after ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is designated ''T&lt;sub&gt;i½&lt;/sub&gt;''. Other implications of these properties include:
* Complete regularity always implies regularity, even without assuming ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'';
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' alone suffices to make a regular space ''T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''. The full ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' property is unnecessary;
* Perfect normality implies complete normality, which in turn implies normality;
* A topological space is completely normal if and only if every subspace is normal.

==Exercises==

#Given a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and given that for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed, show that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Some Important Theorems==

&lt;!--
===Theorem 3.1.1===
A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed for each &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''':&lt;br /&gt; Assume &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Now (by definition of &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;) for every &lt;math&gt;y_i\in X&lt;/math&gt; that is distinct from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; there is an open set &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; containing  &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
Clearly, &lt;math&gt;\bigcup Y_i = X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, and (being equal to a union of opens)  &lt;math&gt;X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is open. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed.

Now if &lt;math&gt;y\in X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are distinct. Thus there is an open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by definition of &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have &lt;math&gt;y\in U\subseteq X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore &lt;math&gt;X\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is open, so &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed. 


Now assume that &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; is closed for each &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; are distinct, then &lt;math&gt;x\in X\setminus\{y\}=O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\in X\setminus\{x\}=O_2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;O_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_2&lt;/math&gt; are open sets not containing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Thus by definition, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;

===Theorem 3.1.2===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; space and let &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; either does not converge in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; or it converges to a unique limit.

'''Proof'''&lt;br /&gt; Assume that &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to two distinct values &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;, there are disjoint open sets &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\in V&lt;/math&gt;.

Now by definition of convergence, there is an integer &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;n\geq M&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;s_n\in U&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly there is an integer &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;n\geq N&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;s_n\in V&lt;/math&gt;.

Take an integer &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; that is greater than both &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;s_K&lt;/math&gt; is in both &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting the fact that the two sets are disjoint. Therefore &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; cannot converge to both &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem 3.1.3===
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is normal.

'''Proof'''

Given any &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, and any point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, define the distance, &lt;math&gt;d(x,A)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; by
&lt;math&gt;d(x,A):=\inf\{d(x,a)|a\in A\}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;d(x,a)&lt;/math&gt; is the distance function supplied by definition of a metric space.  Observe that &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto d(x,A)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

Fix closed, disjoint subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and define &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow [-1,1]&lt;/math&gt; by
&lt;math&gt;f(x):=\frac{d(x,B)-d(x,A)}{d(x,A)+d(x,B)}.&lt;/math&gt;
(Note &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; well--defined, since for any &lt;math&gt;S\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;d(x,S)=0&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the closure of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.)  Observe &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is 1 on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, -1 on &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and in the open interval &lt;math&gt;(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt; elsewhere.  Also, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; continuous by the continuity of &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto d(x,A)&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}([-1,-1/2))\supset B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}((1/2,1])\supset A&lt;/math&gt; are the preimages of open sets (open in &lt;math&gt;[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;, that is) and therefore open, and they're disjoint as the preimages of disjoint sets.

===Theorem 3.1.4===
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, then &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Proof'''&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; be two distinct points, and let &lt;math&gt;d=\tfrac{d(x,y)}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;B_d(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_d(y)&lt;/math&gt; are open sets which are disjoint since if there is a point &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; within both open balls, then &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)+d(x,z)&lt;\tfrac{2}{3}d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction.

===Urysohn's Lemma===
A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is normal if and only if for any disjoint closed sets &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(C_1)=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(C_2)=\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof''&lt;br /&gt;
In order to prove Urysohn's Lemma, we first prove the following result:

Let X be a topological space. X is normal if and only if for every closed set U, and open set V containing U, there is an open set S containing U whose closure is within V.

Suppose that X is normal. If V is X, then X is a set containing U whose closure is within V. Otherwise, the complement of V is a nonempty closed set, which is disjoint from U. Thus, by the normality of X, there are two disjoint open sets A and B, where A contains U and B contains the complement of V. The closure of A does not meet B because all points in B have a neighborhood that is entirely within B and thus does not meet A (since they are disjoint), so all points in B are not within the closure of A. Thus, the set A is a set containing U, and whose closure does not meet B, and therefore does not meet the complement of V, and therefore is entirely contained in V.
Conversely, take any two disjoint closed sets U and V. The complement of V is an open set containing the closed set U. Therefore, there is a set &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; containing U whose closure is within the complement of V, which is the same thing as being disjoint from V. Then the complement of V is an open set containing the closed set Cl(&lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore, there is a set &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; such that Cl(&lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt;) is within the complement of V i. e. is disjoint from V. Then &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and the complement of &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are open sets which respectively contain U and V, which are disjoint.

Now we prove Urysohn's Lemma.

Let X be a normal space, and let U and V be two closed sets. Set &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; to be U, and set &lt;math&gt;U_1&lt;/math&gt; to be X.

Let &lt;math&gt;U_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; be a set containing U_0 whose closure is contained in &lt;math&gt;U_1&lt;/math&gt;. In general, inductively define for all natural numbers n and for all natural numbers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;2^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;U_{\frac{2a+1}{2^n}}&lt;/math&gt; to be a set containing &lt;math&gt;U_{\frac{a}{2^{n-1}}}&lt;/math&gt; whose closure is contained within the complement of &lt;math&gt;U_{\frac{a+1}{2^{n-1}}}&lt;/math&gt;. This defines &lt;math&gt;U_p&lt;/math&gt; where p is a rational number in the interval [0,1] expressible in the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; where a and n are whole numbers.

Now define the function &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; [0,1] to be f(p)=inf{x|&lt;math&gt;p \in U_x&lt;/math&gt;}.

Consider any element x within the normal space X, and and consider any open interval (a,b) around f(x). There exists rational numbers c and d in that open interval expressible in the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; where p and n are whole numbers, such that c&lt;f(x)&lt;d. If c&lt;0, then replace it with 0, and if d&gt;1, then replace it with 1. Then the intersection of the complement of the set &lt;math&gt;U_c&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;U_d&lt;/math&gt; is an open neighborhood of f(x) with an image within (a,b), proving that the function is continuous. 

Conversely, suppose that for any two disjoint closed sets, there is a continuous function f from X to [0,1] such that f(x)=0 when x is an element of U, and that f(x)=1 when x is an element of V. Then since the disjoint sets [0,.5) and (.5,1] are open and under the subspace topology, the inverses &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}([0,.5))&lt;/math&gt;, which contains X, and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}((.5,1])&lt;/math&gt;, which contains Y, are also open and disjoint.

==Exercises==

It is instructive to build up a series of spaces, such that each member belongs to one class, but not the next.

* The indiscrete topology is not &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the unit interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T} = \{ [0,x) | x\in [0,1] \}&lt;/math&gt;, then this space is &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;.
* Consider an arbitrary infinite set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and every finite subset be closed sets, and call the open sets &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Determine whether &lt;math&gt;(X, \Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, is a topological space which is &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;. Hint: Consider the intersection of any two open, non-empty sets.

Verify that
* &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T_3&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; (hint: use theorem 3.1.1)

==Continuity==
Continuity is the central concept of topology. Essentially, topological spaces have the minimum necessary structure to allow a definition of continuity.  Continuity in almost any other context can be reduced to this definition by an appropriate choice of topology.

{{TOC right}}
=== Definition ===

Let &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; be topological spaces.

A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for all open neighborhoods &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is continuous at all points in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

The function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is said to be continuous over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is continuous at all points in its domain.

&lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if for all open sets &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, its inverse &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; is also an open set.&lt;br /&gt;
''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. Let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be an open set in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Because it is continuous, for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;, there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;x\in A\subseteq f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;, since B is an open neighborhood of f(x). That implies that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt; is open.&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
The inverse image of any open set under a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is also open in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be any element of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then the inverse image of any neighborhood &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;, would also be open. Thus, there is an open neighborhood &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(B)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the function is continuous.


If two functions are continuous, then their composite function is continuous. This is because if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; have inverses which carry open sets to open sets, then the inverse &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}(f^{-1}(x))&lt;/math&gt; would also carry open sets to open sets.

=== Examples ===
*Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; have the discrete topology. Then the map &lt;math&gt;f:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous for any topology on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.
*Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; have the trivial topology. Then a constant map &lt;math&gt;g:X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous for any topology on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

== Homeomorphism ==
When a homeomorphism exists between two topological spaces, then they are &quot;essentially the same&quot;, topologically speaking.

=== Definition ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt; be topological spaces&lt;br /&gt;
A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;is said to be a '''homeomorphism''' if and only if &lt;br /&gt;

(i)  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection&lt;br /&gt;
(ii) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous over &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(iii)&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous over &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If a homeomorphism exists between two spaces, the spaces are said to be '''homeomorphic'''

If a property of a space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; applies to all homeomorphic spaces to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, it is called a '''topological property'''.

=== Notes ===
#A map may be bijective and continuous, but not a homeomorphism. Consider the bijective map &lt;math&gt;f:[0,1) \rightarrow S^1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f(x)=e^{2\pi ix}&lt;/math&gt; mapping the points in the domain onto the unit circle in the plane. This is not a homeomorphism, because there exist open sets in the domain that are not open in &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;, like the set &lt;math&gt;\left[ 0,\frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
#Homeomorphism is an equivalence relation

== Exercises ==
#Prove that the open interval &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is homeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.
#Establish the fact that a Homeomorphism is an equivalence relation over topological spaces.
# (i)Construct a bijection &lt;math&gt;f:[0,1]\to [0,1]^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (ii)Determine whether this &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a homeomorphism.

== Relating the Einstein equation to Newtonian physics ==

I have not studied general relativity (but I am an engineer, so I have a reasonably good physics background) and a look at the Einstein equation baffles me.  Would anybody be able to creating an example that shows how the Einstein equation simplies to something that would be taught in a sophmore physics class.

R_ab under &quot;Vacuum Field Equations&quot; should be R_munu for consistent notation, right? I'm not confident enough to change this myself.</text>

further information about the Edit can be found in the talk page.  Previous discussion material is nearly entirely irrelevant as little of the original text is left. Archival information shall be preserved below--[[User:JoliePA|JoliePA]] ([[User talk:JoliePA|talk]]) 17:13, 28 October 2008 (UTC)

== GRAMMER AND SPELLING ==

*Without doubt, grammar and spelling is rough.  It was always one of my greatest weakness  of my writing styles.  Hopefully in time it will improve.

== INTRODUCTION ==
*Introduction is rough and not succinct.

== PALEOINDIANS ==
*Considerable controversy about the Bering ice bridge theory.  Many professionals most espacially cultural linguists and anthropologists feel there were significant connections to early cultures, espacially by boats.  (which were known to exist in this early time).  Unfortunately evidence seems sketchy and proven.  This is Not a exhuastive account of 'models of migration into the American Continents'.  Thus NPOV, in my opinion demands that I include the well tested bering land bridge theory.  While it my not be the only (or even the primary (espacially in South America) it is nearly certain THAT some civilizations came to North America via the bering land bridge.  This was probably the Clovis people.  

== MAYANS AND AZTECS ==
*No talk about the end of the world and the aztec calender.  that is needless gibberish.  if the mayan did correctly forecast the end of the world in 2010; perhaps my book will barely be written (LOL).  The mayans (nor any other ancient civilization) did not study or understand the nature of asteroids. 

*Diminished tales of Human sacrifice which was needlessly sensational.  Not exactly the most important or finest accomplishment of either Mayan or Aztec civilization. (and also not isolated to those two cultures either).

*The tale about sacrificing 84,000 people is considered by most experts to be highly exagerated.  but somehow, it says something significant about Aztec culture that they claimed to kill 84,000 when they didn't.

*I fail to see the relevance of Aztec, Incan or Mayan cultures on the development of the US.  however, I am strictly following the college boards selection of topics.

== NORTH AMERICAN GROUPS (disclaimer) ==
*Discussions about a civilization, culture, tribe, or group all fall short in North America.  frequently, authors stress that these loosely allied groups fall short of many of these definitions.  Thus the Anazani could be considered, a culture, a way of life, a civilization...but not a coherent group, Nation, Tribe, or City.  Within many of these loose groups; groups such as a Nation, tribe, city DO exist they just don't include everyone.
:* the mound builders are perhaps more frustrating to describe, because they dominate a huge area and time and are in places and at time more (and less) unified.

*One could argue that I am excessively focused on the urban centers and buildings.  these large structures are well understood cultural accomplishments that IMHO say much about the power and influence of a civilization.

== NATIVE AMERICANS AFTER EUROPEAN CONTACT ==
*The last section feels weak and unneccessary.  The college board requires that discussions of several large cultures then includes a general blurb &quot;American cultures at the time of European contact&quot;- That has me puzzled having given the history of the most significant American cultures; I have already told the reader there status at &quot;European contact&quot; (and actually briefly discussed what happens after european contact as well).  My only guess is some kind of generalized statement about what European contact did to the native american cultures as a whole.  Its weak!  any ideas would be appreciated.----

== ARCHIVE: General style issues ==

As a teacher who is considering the use of alternative textbooks (rather than those from the traditional mainstream publishers), I was disappointed by the quality of the writing. The information may be fine, but phrases like &quot;an isthmus made of land&quot; and &quot;from whence&quot; are unacceptable in an academic text. I don't mean to be so harsh, but students need all the help with grammar they can get. &quot;[A]n isthmus made of land&quot; is redundant (an isthmus is *always* made of land), as is &quot;from whence&quot; (&quot;whence&quot; essentially means &quot;from where&quot;).

You might as well write, &quot;A strip of land made of land&quot; and &quot;from from where.&quot;

I plan to make a Wikibooks account for myself when I get home tonight (writing from a cafe), but wanted to drop this note as a reminder to everybody that textbooks are typically used in academic settings, so grammatical errors stick out much more than they would in a novel or a newspaper article.

Students don't read history texts because they want to learn how to write, but for anybody whose grammar is in good shape, these sloppy mistakes reflect poorly on the authors, and therefore call into question the quality of the material.

== ARCHIVE: Non sequitur in this section ==

The paragraph copied below contains a major non sequitur, clearly the result of sloppy editing. I can't fix it because I don't know the content.

Offending paragraph:

Such evidence is made even more ambiguous by the traces of DNA that span the Pacific Ocean from Australia to Papua New Guinea, across Micronesia to east Asia. This opens the possibility of sea travel hugging the coast; unfortunately evidence of such a theory that would be left on the shores would be eliminated over time due to sustained coastal erosions and sea level changes. The DNA facts significantly negate, and arguably eliminate, the Bering Strait theory, which is not supported by any conflicting physical evidence. The flint points are used on a flatboard (like bristles on a toothbrush) on the Asian mainland, rather than mounted on spears like the Clovis points, thereby calling into question the idea of tool migration, a major source of this post-Ice-Age migration theory.

[[User:68.40.192.159|68.40.192.159]] 13:03, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

The bering strait ice bridge migration theory is now known to not be supported by any real world evidence, and also is directly contradicted by DNA and archeological evidence. The second editor seems to be refuting the points made at the beginning of the chapter, and introducing the evidence.

== ARCHIVE: Editorial material moved from main article==

The following material was moved by this author from the main article to this discussion page since it contains commentary that, although having merit, is more appropriate for discussion (the original conclusions, however, remain in the main article): The Bearing Strait hypothesis has a number of things wrong wtih it:(1) it is a bigoted, racist 19th century European egocentrist view that aboriginees were ignorant heatherns and therefore just too dumb or stupid  to construct boats to cross oceans. Contrary to this:the earliest boats have been found to date back some 30,000 years and possiblely earlier all over the world. Certainly by 20,000 years ago; boat building had reached  the point that man could cross oceans. The evidence for this comes from Japan et al. (2)Climatological(Ice cores) and wood ring studies do not support the hypothesis because it assumes that humans came down what was then a great ice field blocking easy travel further south where the Alaskan Highway is today.  (3) The theory ignores the fact that people could have used the Aleutians to arrive in North America and many Inuit still travel in such manner from Nome,Alaska back and forth from Little Diomede Island to Big Diomede.  (4)The Bearing Strait theory has a major problem in that if true then some millions of people arrived instantly all at the same time all over North, Central and South America---something not quiet possible.  Humans do not reproduce as fast as bacteria do to arrive at that population level in so short at time and would have needed modern transportation to have distributed so widely in so short of time.[[User:Lottamiata|Lottamiata]] 21:49, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

== ARCHIVE: Redundant material. ==

The following material was removed because it had been mentioned earlier in the article.  Also, some of the detail is too great for a treaty on United States history and Wikipedia links have been provided instead:  These people intermarried with  the descendents some of the first aboriginees  who were alledgely composed of about 5 men and two women. . . .  Such evidence is made even more ambiguous by the traces of DNA that span the Pacific Ocean from Australia to Papua New Guinea, across Micronesia to east Asia. This opens the possibility of sea travel hugging the coast; unfortunately evidence of such a theory that would be left on the shores would be eliminated over time due to sustained coastal erosions and sea level changes. The DNA facts significantly negate, and arguably eliminate, the Bering Strait theory, which is not supported by any conflicting physical evidence.[[User:Lottamiata|Lottamiata]] 23:20, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

Hi, if I could make a suggestion to change this book to International Relations, that could cover a much broader range of subjects. J

== That doesn't make sense ==

Diplomatic history and international relations are two different fields, although related. International relations tries to explain the actions of states and non-state actors through models and formulae. It is a division of political science. It often draws on Diplomatic history to illustrate or illuminate concepts, but exists to a large extent in the abstract.

Diplomatic history is, at its core, historical: What state did what when, and how did that lead to a certain state of world affairs? Diplomatic history is a detailed discipline, that (at its best) does not apply the broad strokes of IR.

So, no, it wouldn't be appropriate to change the name. There's already an IR wikibook anyway.

Best,

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the second example of &quot;Building a Chain from Nodes&quot; nodes are created while intergers are input, then the nodes are iterated over in a while loop. Inside the loop, the current node value is accessed--get-value(nodes)-- then the nodes object is updated--nodes := get-next(nodes)--.

It seems the while loop would exit after the first iteration as the nodes reference is still the last item added and the get-next(nodes) call would return a null. I would have expected to a reference to the first item stored and the nodes object reset to this original reference before the while loop in question was entered. Is this a typo or am I missing an obvious concept?

:The last item added is the front of the list, not the back of the list. I thought about perhaps having some &quot;head&quot; pointer and a tail pointer, but that might be more complicated than this way. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 14:31, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::Thank you, that completly clears up my confusion. I looked at the example for a long time, but missed that the first item in the list starts off with a null reference and all further items reference the previous item. I just couldn't see it. Thanks for the prompt feedback and the great resource.

In this section, the book makes reference to the term &quot;node&quot; as a data type, but isn't singly linked list the more technically correct term? I always thought a linked list was made up of nodes, but the data structure itself was called a linked list.

In the list of node operations is set-next method with return value Node. But in the implementation, there is no return value. set-next is used in the example where data are stored in not reversed order. According to this example, set-next should return Node that has been set as next in original Node.

: I'm thinking the exact same thing. &quot;nodes := set-next (nodes, make-node (i, null)) // append new node to the end of the list&quot; makes no sense in this context, and the current program would malfunction by dropping all but the last two inputs. Also, the line's comment contradicts the discussion above, in which it is stated that the list should be created in reverse order. I'd also add that the implementation smells of bad design: when making a custom data structure for this, why make it mutable? There's no reason to even allow forward creation, since the problem is order-independent. The code becomes longer and harder to reason about for no apparent benefit.

I'm introducing a paragraph in the introduction that explains big-oh notation. I think most people are oblivious to the notation until they start studying data structures and a quick explanation is valuable, especially before it's used in the node structure. I'm also a little confused about the organization. Shouldn't nodes be introduced after arrays since they lead into lists so nicely?

One of the most difficult parts of making a movie is the acquisition of adequate funding for production.  One method to receive the requisite monies is to bring your script concept before an entity that grants funding to third-party production houses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Refraction in a ripple tank.svg|thumb|right|When light travels from one medium to another, it bends.]]

'''Refraction''' is the change in direction and phase velocity of a wave due to a change in the medium in which the wave is traveling. A wave which undergoes this phenomenon is said to have been refracted. This phenomenon is most commonly observed when a wave passes from one medium to another at any angle other than 90° or 0°. Refraction is described by Snell's law (also known as the Snell–Descartes law and the law of refraction), which states that for a given pair of media and a wave with a single frequency, the ratio of the sines of the ''angle of incidence'' ''θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''angle of refraction'' ''θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is equivalent to the ratio of phase velocities (''v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'') in the two media, or equivalently, to the opposite ratio of the indices of refraction (''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin\theta_1}{\sin\theta_2} = \frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1} .&lt;/math&gt;

When a wave travels across an interface and into a medium with a higher index of refraction, the wave bends towards the normal. If a wave travels across an interface and into a lower index of refraction, the wave bends away from the normal. If a wave travels across an interface and into a medium with the same index of refraction, the direction of the wave's propagation does not change. The two most common indices of refraction used when first exploring the topic of refraction are air (n=1.00029) and water (n=1.33). To simplify calculations, the index of refraction of air is typically approximated to be n=1.00 (which is actually the index of refraction of a vacuum).

[[File:Refraction internal reflection diagram.svg|thumbnail|right|Demonstration of no refraction at angles greater than the critical angle.]]
As the angle of incidence increases, the angle of refraction also increases. There comes a point in which the angle of refraction is 90° and means that the wave refracts parallel to the interface. This angle is called the ''critical angle'' and for angles greater than or equal to the critical angle, refraction does not take place and all of the light is reflected; this phenomenon is called ''total internal reflection'' and will be covered in the next section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">School is a place where students, often children, go to learn. The students, also called pupils, learn in groups called classes. A teacher (or teachers) instructs (teaches) each class. Students listen to the teacher and do schoolwork while at school and then homework in the evening at home. 

== Types of schools in the United States ==
In the United States, most children go to public schools for the levels  K-12 (kindergarten &amp; grades 1-12). Public schools are operated by the local government and controlled by a local Board of Education (BOA). Members of the BOA are paid representatives who are elected in each city or township. Public schools in each community are supported by local property taxes and are free to the students. Each state, as well as the federal government, has educational regulations that the local schools must follow. 

Many people criticize the quality of learning in the local school systems, and are looking for new ways for their children to get an education. Some alternatives to public schools are private schools, magnet schools, Montessori schools, home schooling, for-profit schools and web- or Internet-based schools. 

Most private schools are Catholic schools, other Christian schools or private academies. Private schools are usually not free. Students or their families must pay tuition,  which can be very expensive. Some parents send their children to private schools to avoid the bad influences of other students. Many people hope that private schools will offer their children more attention or a better education. 

Magnet schools are public or private schools that focus on a specific area of studies, such as the visual arts, performing arts (drama), or the sciences. 

Montessori schools are learning environments where students can help direct their own studies. Students learn individually, guided by a teacher. 

Home schoolers are students who learn at home with the help of a parent or a tutor, often with religious motivations. This method has been criticized for a long time as inadequate. However, a high percentage of these students are above-average performers, demonstrating academic excellence in comparison to their peers. Some people are concerned that home schoolers miss out on socialization, but parents answer that their children get plenty of social contact at church and in the family, and at neighborhood or community events. In addition, many of these parents desire to avoid the socialization that comes specifically from most public schools, and would prefer their children only to have their socialization from the aforementioned sources.

For-profit schools are schools set up by businesses to make money. Like public schools, these schools usually receive tax money from the government. For-profit schools are relatively new and the schools only exist in a few cities.

Internet-based learning is more common among university-level courses but is starting to be used by some students at the K-12 level.

== Education ==
The goal of schools is to educate their students. Schools use teachers and teaching (didactic) materials to prepare their students with knowledge and skills for future work and life. Education is important for society to function and be productive. By law, American students are required to complete their education (go to school) through high school unless their parent or guardian signs a release note giving them permission to quit school before finishing 12th grade. The great majority of adult Americans have finished high school, and most have gone to at least some college (university-level studies). 

== People at the school ==
There are many people with many jobs at a school besides just students and teachers. The head of the school is called the principal. The principal is in charge of the teachers, administration of the school and the well-being of the students. The principal of each school answers to the superintendent of schools, who is in charge of the entire school system and works with the BOA to make sure that the students can learn effectively in a safe and positive environment. Janitors, custodians, groundskeepers and other maintenance workers clean the schools and make sure that the school grounds are clean, safe and tidy. Guidance counselors help students make decisions and counsel troubled students. The school psychologist helps when the problems are serious or abuse is involved. The school nurse helps sick students and helps assure their health. In many schools there are now police or security officers who maintain security for everyone at the school. The school secretaries help the principal, parents and students with various tasks. Teacher’s assistants are paid to help out in the classroom and often volunteers also help in the classroom in lower grades. Bus drivers pick children up from home in the morning and take them back home in the afternoon in long, yellow school buses. Substitute teachers (subs) teach or take care of classes when the regular teacher is absent. Cafeteria workers (lunch ladies) prepare and serve lunch and sometimes breakfast in the cafeteria. And sometimes other people come to visit the school to give presentations.

== Vacations ==
Students traditionally attend school for five days a week, about six or seven hours a day, for most of the year. They have vacations, or time without classes, for a few months in the summer and a few weeks around Christmas/New Year’s. Summer vacation is a favorite time for children to relax and have a good time, although they tend to complain of boredom. Others use the time for activities such as athletics, and a somewhat smaller group feels the need to do independent studies over vacations.

Schoolwork is usually made up of writing papers, reading books, doing worksheets, solving mathematical problems, researching different topics, doing special projects, and so on. Of course, the type of schoolwork that a teacher assigns to his or her students depends on the level of the class and the topic under study, as well as the preference of the teacher. Homework is sometimes called assignments, which refers to a task that is assigned.

== Classes ==
Students are divided by ages and ability levels into grades, which are usually subdivided into different groups or classes. “Class” can refer to the group of about 25 students who meet together habitually, even if together they study various topics, as is the case in lower grades. “Class” can also mean course, an academic topic or subject that lasts for a school year or part of a school year. A class of this sort only meets together certain hours of the week, for example one hour every day or three times a week. The other common meaning of the word “class” is everyone who is in the same grade level. In high school especially, the students in one grade are collectively known as a class, identified by their year of graduation. The students who graduate in 2006 are called the class of 2006.

One teacher teaches one class at a time. In lower grades, the same teacher usually has the same group of students, or class, all or most of the day. In higher grades, pupils have a different teacher for each class, or subject. Even in lower grades, specialized instructors usually  teach certain courses like art, music, and gym.

Examples of “classes” as courses are reading, general science, and computer class. Students can take classes in the following areas: math (mathematics), including pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics; sciences, including biology, chemistry, physical science, physics, and laboratories (labs); language arts including English, literature, composition, and foreign languages like French or Spanish; music including band, orchestra, and choir; social studies, health, gym, government, art, shop, accounting, and home economics, and many more, depending on the school. Other classes or periods of the day include lunch, recess, and study hall.

== Parts of the school grounds ==
The classroom is where most of the learning takes place, the office is where the principal and other school administrators and the secretary or secretaries work. The gym (gymnasium) is where students have gym class, and the locker room is nearby, where the students change clothes and shower after gym. The playground is where kids go for recess, and everyone who drives parks in the parking lot. Everyone eats lunch in the cafeteria (lunch room) except maybe the teachers, who &quot;hide&quot; in the teacher’s lounge and are believed to complain about the students. In reality, most teachers will have lunch, a discussion, and/or may grade schoolwork of the students. The cafeteria is often considered a social vice, because what often happens is that specific groups of children will sit at specific tables and permit only similar children at their table. Many can remember tables with &quot;cool&quot; people, and its opposite. Still, in some schools, this is less severe or nonexistent, while at others, extremely defined. Kids with problems (or a desire to get out of a class, as the case sometimes is,) can visit the school nurse in the nurse’s office or a guidance counselor in the guidance office. You can imagine what happens in the art, band and choir rooms. Many science rooms, especially at higher levels, have defining features, although they may vary. (ex. chemical storage, non-wood desks, tool storage, emergency features, etc.) The rooms are connected together by halls (hallways). Often, there are main hallways lined with lockers to store books and the like for the students. Many classrooms exist for teaching various subjects. Often, one teacher or group of teachers will have predominant use of the classroom for teaching, and will put posters and diagrams up throughout the room, often making the teacher(s) and/or subjects taught somewhat identifiable from a glance. As with most public establishments, there are often bathrooms throughout the school, and they are often subject to vandalism and lack of care in certain schools.

== Levels of school ==
(Preschool and daycare); ages 0-5, 3-5
Elementary school (grade school): K-5 (kindergarten and grades one through five); ages 5-11
Middle school (junior high school): Grades 6-8; ages 11-14
High school: Grades 9-12; ages 14-18

The above is not status quo as one changes schools by any means. Often children may start late or early, or may stay back and skip grades. State and Local laws usually dictate ages for starting school. In some places, it may be four years and a certain number of months before one can enter elementary schools. There are also school systems that may split up their grades as K-6 to elementary and change other grades.

=== Preschool and daycare ===
Many children attend a sort of day-care or preschool before they are old enough to go to kindergarten. Preschool is usually only a few hours a day and may not be every day. Preschool and daycare can help working mothers be free to go to work. They also can help small children begin to build social skills. Preschool is not a standard part of public education. Preschools are usually small, private institutions run in the neighborhood. 

=== Elementary school ===
Children begin school at age five or six when they enter kindergarten. Kindergarten in the United States is one year long and children typically attend half-days or every other day. Teachers are usually women and are with one class all or most of the day. Teachers’ assistants and classroom volunteers, usually parents, often help out with routine tasks in the classroom. 

Classes may be as small as fifteen students to as large as thirty-five. Both boys and girls of about the same age are taught together in the same room. Subjects include basic reading, math, writing, and cultural issues. 

Younger students tend to spend a large part of their day playing. For example, a kindergartner's play time is mixed in with time for learning basic concepts such as the alphabet, telling time, and how to read basic words. In later grades, play time is reduced to recess, an unstructured time where students can play or do sports or games for an hour or so. 

== Grading ==
Each student gets letter grades in each subject, which range from A to F with A being the best and F being the worst. Pluses (+) and minuses (-) are sometimes used to divide one letter into distinct levels. For example, “B” can be divided into B+, B and B-.

Normally, one must achieve a certain grade measured out of 100 to get a certain letter grade. The scales for what numerical grade constitutes what letter grade often differ by school and teacher(s). Usually, one must have a 92 or a 90 for an &quot;A&quot; range grade, and the letters usually change at a rate of one every ten points with some exceptions. &quot;F&quot; is usually placed at 60-72 percentage points, often at 65. Some systems might not even use &quot;E&quot; as a grade, and skip from &quot;D&quot; to &quot;F&quot; on such a scale.

A GPA (Grade Point Average) is sometimes done out of four points. Usually, achieving an &quot;A&quot; gets one a four, and anything less usually gets a lower point value. These point values are then averaged for this number. Sometimes, for more difficult levels of classes, these numbers are &quot;weighted&quot; in their point values as such.

Sometimes one will get a straight percentage grade, but it is rare to receive this without a letter grade as well.

Some schools now give &quot;L&quot; as a grade to all students, meaning &quot;learning&quot; and the practice is scorned upon. At that point, a grade doesn't matter, since one can not get something otherwise, and the system does not reward those working harder than their peers.

In order to weight assignments, many teachers at higher levels give a certain number of assignments and give them different point values. At the end of the grading period, the points earned is divided by the maximum point total and then multiplied by a hundred to give points out of one hundred.

== Discipline ==
Sometimes students misbehave and must be disciplined. Each school has its own methods, which usually include trips to the principal’s office, notes or calls home to the parents, and after-school detentions. Typical offenses are smoking, fighting, cheating, cursing (cussing or swearing), picking on (bullying) other students, inappropriate clothing (violation of dress code), inappropriate touching or displays of affection, stealing, talking back (insolence), lateness (tardiness), skipping class (cutting class), vandalism, plagiarism or otherwise causing trouble or breaking the rules. Especially serious infractions of student conduct can result in long- or short-term suspension from school, expulsion, or even court dates and jail time, although this is less likely for juvenile offenders.

Several systems of discipline exist, as stated earlier. One common system is to divide the offenses into groups, levels, or tiers. Each one of these has its own unique punishments involved. In such a system, the lowest might be a minor offense, like talking in class, and may be met with a warning, but a repeat offense will put it in the next grouping. The highest usually involves federal offenses and are met extremely seriously.

One system would involve a unique punishment for every situation, but is often difficult to figure out in a school large and/or disorderly enough to prevent a central figure from doing such things, requiring someone such as the teacher to enforce such things on a lower level and decide this. A more efficient method than this case-by-case basis would be some set of rules or a code that would mandate unique punishments for every crime.

Younger children are often subjected to a small set of simplified rules in their classrooms that the teacher places, sometimes with the help of the students. This is in addition to whatever the school requires, but often includes what the school requires, as is relevant to a young child.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Core&quot; maths is no longer the correct term. It is now called &quot;Pure&quot; and the module is no longer called C1, it is P1. Further Pure 1 is FP1 etc...
:I could swear that it was the other way around - they changed it ''from'' pure and it became '''core''' in the process. Hence schools have purchased books for &quot;Core&quot;. - [[User:Estel|Estel]] 20:39, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Estel is correct, for OCR at least. See the specification that is linked to on the actual page. [[User:Mattrix|Mattrix]] 16:21, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Further that. Estel is correct. C1~P1, C2,3,4~P2,P3 as I understand it. This is the last any person will be able to do old 'Pure', such as those who are doing further maths. Those who are doing single maths are, in my school, forced to retake equivalent core modules. Secondly, I am currently taking some Maths exams (p3,4 ; m3 ; d1), and may write something on them here. Unfortunately I have no experience of the new system, so some fiddling around may be needed. --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 22:39, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::Correction, I'm taking the edexcel syllabus, so cannot really contribute fully, other than formulae etc.
:::You should still be able to contribute if you want as the syllabi are broadly similar and you can look at the OCR specification linked to on the main page for more information. [[User:Mattrix|Mattrix]] 15:42, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Congrat Matt :D. This Wikibook is number 21 when it comes to a Google search of &quot;C1 maths OCR revision&quot; - [[User:Estel|Estel]] 15:03, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

Um well I think we should copy the syllabus as closly as possible, it clearly states CORE, and well, just leave it. --[[User:Mitchc|Mitchc]] 07:00, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

In my AQA syllabus, it is called &quot;Pure Core Maths&quot; - maybe that would be a good compromise? [[User:Guiltyspark|Guiltyspark]] 11:02, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

== Is this the correct structure? ==

I was reading in the discussion on another page that this needs to have a mulitple refrence system, so that what is covered in P1 or C1, isn't repeated all over the place. I also question the DE section, does this need its own section or should more be filled in?--[[User:Mitchc|Mitchc]] 06:46, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

:Yes a multiple reference system would be useful eventually, but will be quite difficult. I think the best strategy would be to get the book close to completion based solely on one specification, and then work on an adaption for the most similar specification, and so on. A completed book for one or two specifications is much better than a half-empty structure for lots of specifications. -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 20:10, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

:: I agree with [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]], lets finish the content before we mess about with different contents pages. --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 19:00, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

:I have a suggestion for an improved structure to this wikibook --- separate the contents into pure maths, mechanics, statistics, etc. Within each of these categories, we introduce the concepts in a complete manner, and highlight (colour coding perhaps?) the different demands of the specification modules. --[[User:The.ginkgo.nut|The.ginkgo.nut]] 16:24, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

:: I think this would be handier, but only once the content is much more complete. Then we can expand it to be more of a ''general'' A-level wikibook with pages linking to the exact parts you need to know for each syllabus. --[[User:Avxxv|Avxxv]] 19:26, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

Not that there's really much debate over it now, but the current structure seems to me to be the one which seems most useful, with the information broken down into the modules and topics on the OCR specification. [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 20:51, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

==  Worked problems? ==

Would it be a good idea to provide a couple of good worked problems for each section of the content? Ideally, the problems should be modeled after what might be expected in the actual exam. --[[User:The.ginkgo.nut|The.ginkgo.nut]] 01:12, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

:That's a good idea, so far, I've been using small examples to show certain concepts, but exam style answers with working would be a great help to students. --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 19:59, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

== Mathematics vs. Further Mathematics ==

Briefly: should Mathematics and Further Mathematics come under the same WikiBook, as they are different courses? If not, would at least some restructuring on this page make it clearer which parts are for which? [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 20:45, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

:Further mathematics requires you to take the further pure modules, and any one of the applied modules (Stats, mechanics, or decision), so there is quite a bit of overlap between both courses. I think something saying like &quot;further pure 1 + 2 and an applied module are required for the further maths course&quot; and &quot;the four core modules with two applied modules are required for a qualification in A-level mathematics&quot; should be fine.--[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 21:25, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

----

&quot;A module may only be taken as part of a Mathematics or a Further Mathematics course. A student must therefore take 6 unique modules to be awarded an AS (Advanced Subsidiary) Level qualification in Further Mathematics.&quot;

Is that true?  Can you do AS Maths and AS Further Maths, without doing A2 Maths?  Surely C3 and C4 are prerequisite for FP1.  I did the edexcel course, and did it before the P's became C's, so it may be different, but it seems odd if this is true.  Why do 2 AS's rather than 1 A-Level? [[User:Tango|Tango]] 20:59, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

:You certainly can. FP1 only requires GCSE-level maths, as it is all new (harder stuff), taught at the same time as C1 and C2. And one would rarely choose to take two AS's, the 9 module option would be more common. [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 03:49, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

::Depends on which board you are taking, It seems with OCR the maths and further maths can be taking side by side, conversly for edexcel the further maths modules are dependant upon the entire A level sylabus, and as such the modules are completely different and orderdered to the OCR modules.--[[User:82.153.238.161|82.153.238.161]] 15:17, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

== Differential Equations ==

Is this really a module for OCR? [[User:Aleksev|Aleksev]] 13:33, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

*I can't see it as a seperate module, although the subject is part of Further Pure Mathematics 3 (FP3), and Core Mathematics 4 (C4). [[User:Silverfish|Silverfish]] 17:19, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

*It is a module, I'm currently taking it. [[User:CardboardCup|CardboardCup]] 14:15, 12 March 2006 (UTC)

==High school applications==
I'm a high school teacher, and would like to contribute.  It would be useful to me if this mapped onto high school courses.  Does it, or, can we work on that?  Let me know if/how I can help! [[User:70.26.230.177|70.26.230.177]] 04:35, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
:Sure, A-levels are taken between the ages of 16-18, so I think this is the same sort of material as high school. You can have a look at the syllabus on the front page of this book to see what topics need to be covered. From there you should be able to find out which parts of the books map onto high school courses. [[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 12:40, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

== is CS1 complete? ==
All pages in CS1 are marked as complete (4 green squares), shouldnt CS1 be marked as complete on this page as well?

PS. great job with this A-level book, it looks great, so much of this stuff isnt taught in the Canadian High School Curiculum.

--[[User:24.141.251.98|24.141.251.98]] 20:33, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

== Answers to textbooks ==

When I was going through the course, I did some of my homework on the computer (in LaTeX, no less), so I can assemble things like [[User:Odd_bloke]] with relative ease. I've checked out the legality of this before (it falls under 'an annotated text'). Do people think this would be a valuable addition? [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 03:52, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

== Proposed name change ==

All other books dealing with A-level subjects are styled with the first ''l'' of ''level'' being lower-case. In order to gain consistency throughout our A-level series, this book should be renamed [[A-level Mathematics]]. I trust this will be an uncontroversial change, but before asking [[User:Tsca.bot]] to help out, I thought I'd note it here to allow for any comments others may have, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:14, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
:I agree, go ahead with the change.--[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 19:03, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

== Uncategorised pages ==

I have added on the contents page a couple of modules that were listed as orphaned. Please either integrate these modules into this book, or alternatively mark them for deletion. Thanks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:14, 3 July 2006 (UTC)


== Broken Link ==

--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] ([[User talk:Billymac00|talk]]) 04:28, 15 March 2008 (UTC)
:I've replaced the link with what seems to be a link to the same (or an updated) file. The file name is the same. [[User:Silverfish|Silverfish]] ([[User talk:Silverfish|talk]]) 15:30, 12 July 2008 (UTC)

== Statistics 1 - OCR(MEI) ==

This page is currentely being edited, it is not as the query suggests, a page created in error. Could this be removed? Thanks. --[[User:Nothingtosomething|Nothingtosomething]] ([[User talk:Nothingtosomething|talk]]) 18:25, 13 April 2008 (UTC)

== A question ==

I was thinking about adding to some of the AQA AS modules (C1 and FP1). Should content be written as prose, or as a summary of course content? Does each section deserve a (sub-)page of its own, or should it all be summed together in one document?

Never done anything on Wikibooks, so any advice/thoughts would be appreciated! =D  --[[User:DTR|DTR]] ([[User talk:DTR|talk]]) 21:10, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

== Thank you ==

To whoever created this, thank you very much. It's been a big help for me whilst studying polynomials for a-level. I hope you finish the job because I'm sure others would love to use the whole thing, and I will continue to use it if other parts I now need are added.
Excellent job, big pat on the back!!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Origin of Counting ==
Perhaps, counting began when early men did something like put a stone in a bowl or a pit in the ground for each of his flock that went out to graze.  When the flock returned he would take out a stone for each returning animal. If there was a stone or stones left after the last animal returned he would know that he needed to find out what happened to that or those animals.

It is possible that he would begin to give a name for each group of stones, that is one stone, would have a name, two stones would have a name and so-forth.  It is also probable that he already had a name for numbers based on counting with fingers.  Counting on fingers might have been the beginning of dividing numbers into groups of ten.

== Learning to Count ==

Watching a three year old learn to count there a number of apparent stages.  

First they learn to repeat a series of sounds they hear
&quot;aye-bee-cee-dee...&quot; and &quot;one-two-three-four...&quot;

Second they associate the sounds &quot;one-two-three-four...&quot; with pointing at a group of objects, but don't yet make the one to one association.

Then they start to learn the one to one association between the objects and the words.

Finally they start learning the rules needed to count accurately,

# Point at each object as you say the next word.
# Point at the object only once and move to the next.
# Don't randomly select the next object, but proceed sequentially.
# Remember where you've started and what you've already counted.

=== Demonstration ===

Given a set of objects,

[[Image:Red ball.png]][[Image:Red ball.png]][[Image:Red ball.png]]
[[Image:Red ball.png]]

start at one side 

[[Image:Blue ball.png]][[Image:Red ball.png]][[Image:Red ball.png]]
[[Image:Red ball.png]]

and proceed until

...

[[Image:Blue ball.png]][[Image:Blue ball.png]] [[Image:Blue ball.png]] [[Image:Red ball.png]]

each has been counted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:Note: This creative work by WikiBooks editors is based on the Toki Pona language, currently published in the official '''[https://www.createspace.com/4802024 Toki Pona book]''' and website: http://tokipona.org

'''[[w:Toki Pona|Toki Pona]]''' is a [[w:constructed language|constructed language]] designed by [[w:Canada|Canadian]] [[w:translation|translator]] and [[w:linguistics|linguist]] Sonja Lang. Toki Pona is a minimal language. Like a [[w:pidgin|pidgin]], it focuses on simple concepts and elements that are relatively universal among cultures. It was designed to express maximum meaning with minimum complexity. The language has 14 [[w:phoneme|phoneme]] and 118 words. It was not designed as an [[w:international auxiliary language|international auxiliary language]], but instead inspired by [[w:Taoism|Taoist]] philosophy, among other things.

The language as of 2010 has been in continuous use for about ten years, and more than 50,000 words have been written in this language by hundreds of people.  The corpus is large enough to do a field linguistics survey based on this corpus.  Please feel free to contribute to the writing of any section.  Keep in mind that this is an objective document describing toki pona usage and not a creative document of language construction.  Please briefly quote the toki pona and give due credit to all sources to support your analysis.

In sections where toki pona &quot;lacks&quot; a construction, explain what periphrasic techniques have been observed to express the same thing. Very frequently when one reads that a language lacks tense or grammar, what is being expressed is that the tense or grammar is isolating, periphrasic or lexical and not inflecting. toki pona is almost entirely isolating, so it will be tempting but incorrect to fill in all the sections with &quot;toki pona does not have comparatives, datives, etc&quot;

It is hoped that readers and contributors will both learn about field linguistics and better understand how toki pona has been used.

The solution is wrong.  The number sequence portrayed goes 3, 3-1=2,2*2+4, 4-3=1, 1*5=5, 5-6=-1,-1*6=-6...


It's nonsensical.  The number 4 is skipped, then the number 6 is repeated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Tale of Two Cities has a number of prominent themes.  A theme is a central idea that is explored through a novel.

Rebirth is a good theme in a tale of two cities

==The unnecessary bloodshed in the revolution==
In A ''[[w:Tale of Two Cities|Tale of Two Cities]]'', [[w:Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens]] tries to convey the message that a revolution is necessary in France by using the Marquis Evrémonde as an archetype of the French aristocrats, and also by causing the reader to sympathize with the peasants.  He engages in a few exceptionally cruel acts, such as running over a child, and complaining: “‘It is extraordinary to me,…that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children.  One or the other of you is for ever in the way&quot;.

Although the revolution was so incredibly necessary due to the cruelty of the aristocrats, it is also evident that many of the revolutionaries were also equally cruel. Any rational person would certainly realize that, if anything, Darnay should be rewarded by the revolutionaries for willfully giving up the fortune that he inherited.  In addition to plotting to kill Darnay, Madame Defarge also pursues Lucie Manette, who is clearly a kind woman who poses no threat to anybody.  The only reason for pursuing her is because she is, by marriage, related to the Marquis Evrémonde.  However, these feelings against the Evrémonde's are only because of her personal issues with them, and not in the interest of the Republic.

'''Archaeology''' or archeology (American English) is the study of human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains, including architecture, artefacts, biofacts, human remains, and landscapes. The goal of archaeology is to shed light on long-term human prehistory, history, behaviour and cultural evolution. It is the only discipline which possesses the method and theory for the collection and interpretation of information about the pre-written human past, and can also make a critical contribution to our understanding of documented societies. Other subfields of anthropology supplement the findings of archaeology, especially cultural anthropology (which studies behavioural, symbolic, as well as material dimensions of culture) and physical anthropology (which includes the study of human evolution and osteology). Other disciplines also supplement archaeology, such as paleontology (the study of prehistoric life), including paleozoology, paleoethnobotany and paleobotany, geography, geology, history, art history, and classics.

Archaeology is an approach to understanding lost cultures and the mute aspects of human history, without a cut-off date: in England, archaeologists have uncovered the long-lost layouts of medieval villages abandoned after the crises of the 14th century and the equally lost layouts of 17th century parterre gardens swept away by a change in fashion. In downtown New York archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the Black burial ground.

Archaeology has been described as a craft that enlists the sciences to illuminate the humanities.

==Subdisciplines==
===Biblical Archaeology===
Focuses on the period of the bible, but embracing all of the ancient Near East and was originally concerned with validating historical events and personages from the bible.

===Classical Archaeology===
Focuses on the Classical World (Greece, Rome, and the Mediterranean).

===Historical Archaeology===
Focuses on the most recent half millennium of human existence, particularly the expansion of European powers into the rest of the world and the impacts of the industrial revolution.  Although this has become the standard meaning of historical archaeology, there are many situations where archaeology works as only one of the tools to discover the past, complementary to written or oral historical traditions.  The archaeology of Ancient Egypt, Han China and many other places is also a historical archaeology.

===Historic Site Archaeology===
In the Americas, historical archaeology, or more properly, &quot;historic site archaeology&quot; is the term generally used to encompass the archaeology of Euro-Canadian/Euro-American and aboriginal/First Nation sites dating to the period of first European settlement or later. Sites attributable to the era of European exploration from Columbus to the advent of first settlement are often deemed to be &quot;proto-Historic&quot; in age and may be further categorized as being either pre-, post-, or proto-Contact in nature (the time of &quot;Contact&quot; between European and aboriginal/First Nations peoples being locally or regionally defined).

===Near Eastern Archaeology===
Focuses on the Ancient Near East (the early civilizations that arose in the area known as the fertile crescent).

===Mesoamerican Archaeoloy===
Study of the pre-columbian societies inhabiting much of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, parts of El Salvador and Honduras. This area comprises shared cultural traits and were made up of many complex sites over thousands of years. Most famously, this area includes the ancient Maya, the Olmec, and the Aztecs. 

===New World Archaeology===
Focuses on the Americas. Very broadly defined, this includes the study of all cultures from North and South America, including the many culture areas such as Mesoamerica, Amazonia, the Andes, the American Northeast, Southeast, Northwest and Southwest. Inuit and Native Canadian Archaeology is also part of this very broad term.

===Prehistory===
Focuses on the period before written history

===Underwater and Maritime Archaeology===
The specialty field of conducting archaeological investigations in submerged and maritime environments. This can include prehistoric sites, shipwreck sites, and other nautical/ maritime related contexts.

===Zooarchaeology===
The study of animal bones recovered from archaeological sites. Zooarchaeological research involves the identification and interpretation of animal bones recovered from archaeological contexts in the effort to gain information on the diets and patterns of animal exploitation of the people whose activities resulted in the formation of the site(s) under study.

Zooarchaeology involves much more than just the creation of so-called 'laundry lists' of animal species represented among the food remains recovered from an archaeological site (usually listed by taxa in order of abundance), although that was typically the limit of the extent to which the zooarchaeological data was cited in many archaeological reports until relatively recently. While such lists can be extremely useful to both archaeologists and zoologists, in more recent times zooarchaeological data has been used in the reconstruction of diet, seasonal scheduling of hunting/fishing activities, hunting and fishing methods, methods of butchery and food preparation, the use of animal bones and related materials for the production of tools and other artefacts (see: [[w:osteodontokeratic industry]]), the process of animal domestication and use, and much more.

==Dating Techniques==
===Dendrochronology===
As trees grow they create annual growth rings, which can be counted to determine the age of the tree when it was cut. The thickness of these rings is determined by annual climactic factors, and certain distinctive ring patterns found in several pieces of timber can be used to verify their contemporaneity.

===Obsidian Hydration===
Obsidian is a volcanic glass used by many cultures in tools and weapons. When a fresh surface is exposed (during the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flintknapping flintknapping] process, for example), it attracts water from the surrounding atmosphere. This water diffuses into the obsidian and creates a hydration rind on the exposed surface. This rind can be viewed using a microscope, and its thickness can be used to determine how long ago the surface of the tool or weapon was produced by flintknapping.

#Sydney Carton
#:At the beginning of the novel, Sydney Carton was a drunkard who did not have any real goals in life.  While his physical resemblance to Charles Darnay is astounding, he is, at the beginning at least, his opposite.  However, Carton's genuine love for Lucie Manette cause him to selflessly give up his own life to help Lucie, thereby rising him to a moral status that is higher than his physical counterpart.
#Charles Darnay
#:Charles Darnay is a member of the Evremonde family.  He renounces his future title of the Marquis, and tries to convince his family to stop being so cruel to the people of the country.  We first see Darnay after he has moved to England and is being tried for treason.  He later becomes a Tutor and marries Lucie Mannette. He is often considered the main protagonist.
#Lucie Manette Darnay- daughter of Doctor Manette. 
#Madame Therese Defarge
#:A cruel and heartless woman, Madame Defarge embodies and epitomises the cruelty and relentlessness of the peasants in the revolution.  She coldly knits names into a register of people who are doomed to die for the revolution.  Defarge eventually dies symbolically by her own gun 
#Monsieur Ernest Defarge
#Monseigneur the Marquis St. Evremonde
#:Monseigneur the Marquis is part of the Evremonde family and has inherieted the title of Marquis.  He is the uncle of Charles Darnay and is very cruel to the people in his country.  His cruelty is shown when he runs over a child in the street and gives a coin as compensation to the father.  He is killed by a Revolutionist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Environment sensors are sensors that detect and interpret things in the outside world (such as obstacles, sounds, and signs) or about the outside world (such as temperature, pressure, and viscosity).

Some of the more common kinds of environment sensors are discussed here.

== Object Sensors ==
There are several sensors that are designed to determine the location and size of various objects in the world.
* [[../Sensors/Computer Vision|Digital cameras]] can, with enough processing power, locate specific objects in their field of view.
* [[../Sensors/Tactile Sensors|Tactile sensors]] can detect how much force is being applied to a specific point.
* [[../Sensors/Distance Sensors|Distance sensors]] use various methods to determine the distance to the nearest object in a given direction.

== Media Sensors ==
Some sensors detect properties of the immediate environment, such as:
* [[../Sensors/Thermal Sensors|Temperature]]
* [[../Sensors/Pressure Sensors|Pressure &amp; Sound]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">A [[../Digital_image_Acquisition|digitally acquired image]] comes in the form of a matrix of vectors.
Each of these vectors is called a '''pixel''' and represents a specific color.
If the matrix is displayed with each cell filled in with the corresponding color, it creates a picture of the scene from the point of view of the camera.

==Camera Calibration==
Cameras are devices which are used to convert 2-d or 3-d reality into 2-d representations. While post processing can re-create 3-d representations from the initial 2-d images, the camera output is a projection of reality on a 2-d plane. Because light is used as the projection mechanism, anything that alters the path or character of the light rays from the object to the sensor plane will affect the fidelity of that initial 2-d representation on the sensor plane.

Cameras are not perfect devices. Because they are built with real-world components having real-world characteristics, their ability to represent reality is limited by the physical properties of their constituent parts. Broadly speaking, there are three kinds of distortions that can occur:

* Geometric - Spatial shifting of object representations on the sensor plane due to the design and characteristics of the optical system
* Radiometric – Errors in the reported “brightness values” recorded on each pixel due to variations in pixel sensitivity, occurrence of “hot” or dead pixels, and varying pixel full well capacity.
* Spectral – Errors in the reported “brightness values” due to the varying response of the sensor to different wavelengths of light.

The focus of this chapter is on Geometric Distortion – its causes and remedies.

==Exterior Orientation==
Exterior Orientation is defined as the position (x,y,z) and angle (tip, tilt, yaw) of the camera relative to the object scene. Even with a perfect camera, distortions due to the exterior orientation will be introduced. These can easily be removed by knowing these six elements of exterior orientation and employing techniques of solid analytical geometry. Solving for unknown exterior orientation elements is covered under the topic of photogrammetry and is generally considered part of the calibration of the entire camera system (which includes its object scene environment). Camera calibration, per se, usually refers to correcting for a camera's interior orientation. 

==Interior Orientation==
Interior Orientation is defined as the relative orientation and characteristics of components within the camera proper. These include:

* Calibrated focal length – the distance between the rear nodal point of the lens and the image plane when an object at infinite distance is brought to precise focus on the image plane.
* Optical properties of the lens system – the ability of the lens to alter normal “pin hole” geometry by clever optical designs. For example, telecentric lenses behave like telephoto lenses in their ability to “compress depth” and eliminate scale errors due to perspective, yet are designed for near-range applications.
* Principle point – where the optical axis intersects the sensor plane (not always in the center).
* Angle of the optical axis to the sensor plane. Normally, the optical axis is perpendicular to the sensor plane. If it is not, the resulting image will have a characteristic distortion. There are times, however, when this angle is deliberately altered to achieve some other objective. For example, some cameras are capable of employing the “Scheimpflug condition” - whereby the image plane, object plane, and lens plane all intersect upon a common line. Assuming the lens law is observed, this configuration ensures that all points on the object plane will be in focus, even though it is not perpendicular to the optical axis. Although this configuration preserves focus, it introduces additional geometric distortions.
* Flatness of the sensor plane – more of an issue with analog film than modern digital sensors.
* Lens Distortion – properties of a lens that alter the ideal “pin hole” model. Lens distortion and lens / sensor plane orientation are typically the largest contributors to geometric distortion within interior orientation.

==Lens Distortion==
Lens distortion causes image points to be displaced from their ideal “pin hole model” locations on the sensor plane. These displacements can be further described as:

* Radial – displacements either towards or away from the center of the image. Technically, displacements are radial to the principle point location. Radial displacements can be modeled with a polynomial, where the first few terms describe most of the effect. 
* Tangential – displacements occur at right angles to the radial direction. Typically, tangential displacements are much smaller than radial displacements.
* Asymmetric Radial or Tangential – the error functions vary (different radial functions for different radials, different tangential functions for different locations on the image plane)
* Random – displacements that cannot be modeled by any mathematical process.

===Ideal Pin-hole Model===
The pin hole model is used to represent the ideal lens. It simply enforces the idea that rays of light travel in straight lines from the object, though the pin hole, to the image (sensor) plane.

Expensive lenses approximate this pin-hole model behavior. 

[[Image:Pinhole_geometry_1.gif]]

==Goals of Camera Calibration==
The goal of camera calibration is to correct the image displacements which occur due to elements of the camera's interior orientation. There are two general approaches used for camera calibration:

* Model-based approaches – specific elements of the error are modeled and corrected for.
* Mapping-based approaches – the focus is on generating a comprehensive reality-to-image (or image-to-reality) mapping function, without regard to understanding the underlying contributing causes.

===Model-based Approaches===
With a Model-based approach, one attempts to identify a few predominant factors contributing to error, model them, measure them, and correct for them. For each contributing factor, a mathematical equation is proposed to model the error. For example, radial lens distortion can be modeled with a four-term polynomial of the form: 

delta r = (k1 * r) + (k2*r^3) + (k3*r^5)+ (k4*r^7)+ (k5*r^9) + .............

Usually, the first two or three terms are sufficient to completely describe the radial error. Note that this is a model of the error, not the actual error. Models can approximate the error, but never fully correct for error effects.

After determining the appropriate model (assume we pick the first three terms above to model radial lens distortion), the next step is to determine the values of the coefficients which best model the observed error. This can be accomplished in one of two ways:

* Explicit Approach – Use of targets with known (x,y), (x,y,z), or angular positions. Precision calibration frames, field approaches, stellar observations, or collimator banks can be used to generate targets of known position. 
** Pros: Precise
** Cons: Expensive and time consuming
* Implicit Approach – Use of objects with known geometric properties, but no known positional or angular orientation. Examples include the checkerboard approach, where the property that all the control points lie in a plane is exploited. Similarly, the Plumb-line approach exploits the fact that a series of physical plumb lines hung from a straight bar not only define a plane, but also produce a series of straight parallel lines which could be imaged. If the lines in the resulting image are not straight, the error can be attributed to lens distortion.
** Pros:
*** Relatively simple, fast, cheap
*** Simple models can usually account for most of the error
** Cons:
*** Not as precise as explicit approach, but usually good enough

====Summary of Model-based Approaches====
;Pros
* Relatively simple, fast, cheap
* Only a few factors influence geometry – mostly optical configuration and lens distortion
* Simple models account for most of the error
;Cons
* Can only remove errors represented by terms in the model
* Unknown causes of error are ignored, or simply result in higher residuals

===Mapping-based Approaches===
With a mapping-based approach, no attempt is made to understand the individual contributing causes of error. The entire focus is on generating a comprehensive reality-to-image (or image-to-reality) mapping function. Simple rubber-sheeting would be an example of such a transformation.

For example, imagine setting up a high precision x-y plotter in front of a camera, oriented so it is perpendicular to the camera's optical axis. Next, a pin-hole light source is mounted on the plotter pen holder in such a way as it can be moved to any location in its plotter-based x-y plane. Further, imagine that for every possible position of the light source, we can capture the row and column of the single pixel illuminated.

For a VGA format image (640 columns by 480 rows), there are 307,200 pixels. If we were to drive the plotter to each of 307,200 positions, and record what real world (x,y) coordinate mapped to each and every pixel, we would have achieved the building of an explicit mapping function. 

With this approach, all potential causes of errors come out in the wash – whether they're known or not. All that matters is having the explicit image to reality mapping preserved.

In reality, nobody bothers to separately illuminate 307,200 pixels. However, the process can be approximated by collecting similar measurements on several hundred patches (16 * 16 pixels in size, for example) and employing a piece-wise transformation for each patch. This process could be further automated by driving the plotter to the hundreds of control point locations.

====Summary of Mapping-based Approaches====
;Pros
* Can handle any and all distortions – even those unanticipated. 
* Very precise – sub-pixel accuracy
* Only needs to be done once - if nothing moves in the mean time
* Lends itself to automated approaches
;Cons
* Lots of explicit control required. Control point generator must be a “trusted source” - plotter errors would be passed on.
* Expensive and time consuming

==Summary of Camera Calibration==
By employing either a model-based or mapping-based approach to camera calibration, most of the image displacement errors caused by elements of interior camera orientation can be removed prior to further processing.

==Image Segmentation==
The purpose of image segmentation is to split a source image into multiple destination images or Regions of Interest based on certain criteria. For example, it may be beneficial to find a single part out of a bin. For navigation systems, it may prove useful to extract only floor lines from an image.

===Algorithm: Region Growing===
Start by finding a single set pixel. Search all the pixels around it. For every set pixel around one that is set, search all the pixels around it, and so on. This algorithm is not very efficient in terms of computational power, but it does extract regions with no post-processing required.

===Algorithm: Edge Detection===
Begin by searching for disparities in the image. Once a disparity surpasses a certain minimum size and threshold in luminosity or other characteristic, it is an edge. After all the edges have been found, look for regions bounded by edges. The example image has very well-defined edges, making it simple to process. However, many real world images have smoother gradients, making their edges harder to detect. Edge detection is also vulnerable to many types of noise, which will disrupt the edge detection.

===Algorithm: MultiScaling===
MultiScaling is a useful technique whenever multiple scales of an image can be obtained. Many camera image processors can emit a thumbnail along with the main image. This low-resolution thumbnail can be used as a plan for searching the main image. Specifically, any areas in the low-resolution image lacking in pixels likely represent empty or very sparse areas in the full image. If we are willing to sacrifice detection of small blobs for speed, MultiScaling is an efficient approach.

===Algorithm: Sequential Searches===
The goal of a sequential search is to examine each and every pixel once and only once. When new pixels are found, they are compared against previously found groups of pixels, and inserted into that group. If a pixel is found to be in two groups, the groups must be combined.

Feedback sensors are used to detect the actuator's output so that the control system can correct for external factors.

For example, many robots are propelled forward by wheels connected to DC motors.
The control system specifies the amount of power that should be applied to the motors to make them turn, but their speed is also affected by the amount of load on the motor.
In order for the robot to travel at a constant speed, it is necessary to have a sensor that determines how fast the robot is moving, and adjusts the power level to the motors as needed.

There are several standard kinds of feedback sensor that are used:
* [[/Encoders/]]
* [[/Tachometers/]]
* [[/Accelerometers/]]
* [[/Rate Gyroscopes/]]

== Apple icon ==

I've seen that icon before. I know it's from iMovie or FCP or one of those. It looks awfully familiar; it's from an Apple product. It's altered, but I don't think that makes it legal. [[User:65.35.3.81|65.35.3.81]] 23:13, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

: Hi 65.35.3.81 (!), thanks loads for your comments. This issue was discussed briefly in the Google Groups list a while back... please do get involved in the discussion at the link above. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 10:15 21 Feb 2005 (GMT)

== PC vs. Windows ==

The &quot;Movie Making Manual-PC in film production&quot; section should really read &quot;Movie Making Manual-Windows in film production&quot;. A PC is a ''Personal Computer''. Windows is just one OS that can run on the x86 arch.

: Yeah, good idea. I'll move it... [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 11:18 16 April 2005 (GMT)

== WTF ==

I don't mean to be so negative, but I just read through the whole screenwriting section and it made me sick. It's ''HORRIBLE''. The entire section focuses on futile tips and pointers to get a script accepted by a Hollywood studio and the screenwriter as merely one small cog in the machinery of one of them. The &quot;writing for low budget&quot; part made me laugh. It mentions writing extra scenes to have a &quot;clean&quot; version for when it goes to TV, and how to keep the rating down in order to sell more. In my opinion, this section should focus on ways to make a '''script''' believeable, with more focus on writing for low-budget, DIY projects. Ninety percent of the info here is completely worthless to anyone who isn't practically established in Hollywood.

: Thanks for your comments. I would make two suggestions. Firstly, come and discuss your opinions in the [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/moviemakingmanual MMM Google Group] - we could do with a bit of controversy to spice things up! Secondly, if you don't like the content then edit it! [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 8:55 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)

:: As the person who wrote that section (for the most part) I'll say that it comes from my experience in the industry, dealing with a particular genre and distribution of film, namely action-adventure for the international market. Many other types of scripts exist for many other different demographic groups. I have written and read scripts from these other genres, however I do not feel qualified to run on about it as I have not yet produced these films. I think the section on screenwriting can benefit from your input as to how to makie a film believable, the two subjects do not have to remain mutually exclusive. The section needs more information... please write it. [[User:cauri|cauri]] 10:53 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)

== module naming ==

Hi, I believe you should consider refactoring the MMM to use either:
* A false namespace, like the cookbook. E.g. &quot;Movie making manual:Screenplay format&quot;
* Subpages. E.g. &quot;Movie making manual/Screenplay format&quot;
See [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] for more information about this. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:08, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

: Hi Kellen. Many thanks for your comments. To be honest, we gave quite a lot of thought to the module names (you can read our discussion on the topic [http://groups.google.com/group/moviemakingmanual/browse_thread/thread/0baa2e0067b0c9bd/c68765557a29a31c#c68765557a29a31c here]). Kellen, do you feel our existing naming convention is so bad that it MUST be changed? To be honest, it'll be a fair amount of work to change every module and I'm not eager to go through that hassle unless it's absolutely necessary. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 8:58 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)

:: No, I don't think it ''must'' be changed, but it does look a bit odd in relation to the other books on here; I found myself having to look twice to find what the actual section name was in the title.

::: OK, thanks for letting us know. I've alerted the [http://groups.google.com/group/moviemakingmanual/browse_thread/thread/662f6267f555ca09/4d3a10aa3bf3909f#4d3a10aa3bf3909f MMM Google Group to this issue]. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 10:27 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)

:::: On the topic of naming conventions, are there any naming conventions for categories? We're using quite a few categories for the movie making manual. See [[:category:Movie Making Manual|this root MMM category]] to see our category naming in action. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 11:15 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)

::::: I don't think there are any conventions for categories. There's not really a lot of categorization going on here right now, so I don't think it's been seen as a real issue. The Cookbook has a lot of categories, but we have somewhat inconsistent names for them (fixing that is on my list of TODO's). I am sort of inclined to have a prefix on all the categories related to a particular book, e.g. &quot;Category:Cookbook:Vegan recipes&quot; or &quot;Category:Movie making:Cinematography&quot; because at some point I can see there being difficult overlaps when we have enough books. Who gets to own Category:Tools? or does that category just get polluted with modules from different books? Seems like the &quot;top level&quot; categories (ones w/o a prefix) should be for categorizing books as a whole, then scoped categories (w/ prefix) should be used w/in books.... but that's just me musing about it.

:::::: Humf... OK, maybe I should think about prefixing all our categories. I've asked about categories in the [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Naming_convention_for_categories.3F|staff lounge]]. Kellen, you might like to cut-and-paste your response to the staff lounge. [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 18:37 22nd Sept 2005 (GMT)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Where should we host our Movie Making Manual?

=Reasons for keeping it on WikiBooks=
* It's free
* It's neutral teritory
* It helps keep knowledge in one place
* We're likely to get more hits
* It'll be a real pain to move the book elsewhere
* People are already starting to learn about the book and might be put off if we move it now

=Reasons for taking it elsewhere=
* WikiBooks is SLOW (although they have ordered 5 new servers which may speed things up)
* We can't get access to the MySQL database (not a major problem)
* There's no easy way to backup all our work (although I imagine that wikibooks do run regular backups)

'''Melanzane Parmigiana''' was originally a Sicilian dish called ''Parmiciana di melenzane'', ''parmiciana'' being the slats of a wooden shutter which resemble the layering of the slices of eggplant in the dish. In the form in which it is now known worldwide, it is generally an oven baked dish consisting of aubergine, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella and tomato sauce.

==Ingredients==

* 3 or 4 big [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplants]] (aubergines)
* [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]]
* about 200 or 300 [[Cookbook:gram|grams]] of [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]], sliced
* grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] or breadcrumbs
* [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] to [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

;Optional:
* fresh [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Hard Boiled Eggs| eggs]]

==Procedure==

#Wash eggplants and cut them in slices about 1-1.5 [[Cookbook:Centimetre (cm)|cm]] thick.  
#Salt each slice on both sides and put them on a big plate.
#Cover them with another plate, pressing a bit.
#Let them rest for 60/ 90 minutes or more, time permitting (up to 2 hours).
#Then wash the slices under running water and let them dry a while.
#Alternatively, place salted eggplant slices in a large strainer and place a weight (e.g., a smaller pot of water) on top to help squeeze out the water.
#Dust the slices with flour (and/or bread crumbs) after in the eggs and fry them. (Or, bake them in an oven at 180°C/350°F for ten minutes with a very  small amount of olive oil on each slice to make them somewhat lighter than if fried.) Do not overcook, as they will spend some time in the oven later.
#Take a pan for the oven and make a layer with eggplants slices, then one with the tomato sauce, then one with some slices of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Some cooks add fresh basil leaves.
#Make as many layers as you wish, but 3 or 4 should be enough. Be sure the last one to be completely full of Parmesan cheese, that will make a nice crust when cooked.
#Now everything is finished, put the pan in the oven at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|180°C (350°F)]] for about 20-30 minutes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Variables allow you to store and change information.  Below is an example how to use variables.

== Example Code for Variables ==
'''Example 1 (qBasic)'''
&lt;SOURCE lang=&quot;qbasic&quot;&gt;CLS
ASTRING$ = &quot;Hello World&quot;
ANUMBER% = 10
PRINT ASTRING$
PRINT ANUMBER%&lt;/SOURCE&gt;

'''Example 1.2 (freeBasic)'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;freeBasic&quot;&gt;
Cls
Dim aString As String
Dim anInteger As Integer
aString = &quot;John Doe&quot;
anInteger = 42
Print aString
Print anInteger
Sleep
End
&lt;/source&gt;

==Output==
'''Example 1'''
 Hello World
 10

In Basic, a string variable ends in a $, and whole number variables, known as integers, end with a %.&lt;br /&gt;

'''Example 2'''
 John Doe
 42

If you use ''Dim varName As DataType'' to declare variables, you do not need to use a suffix.&lt;br /&gt;

== Arrays ==
An array is a collection of values.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;freeBasic&quot;&gt;
Cls
Dim aNames(3) as String
aNames(1)=&quot;John Doe&quot;
aNames(2)=&quot;Jane Doe&quot;
PRINT aNames(1)
PRINT aNames(2)&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Repairing Permissions===

The file system in Mac OS X is based on a derivative of UNIX called Darwin.  All UNIX based systems use what is known as &quot;permissions&quot; to manage all the files stored on your drive, from files vital to the operation of the system itself to the photo of your pet rock.

Occasionally, the permissions of some files may become incorrect, and if this happens to system files, you can get problems including a slow down of the system to unexpected crashes or freezing.

Many times, you can &quot;repair permissions&quot; and the problems will stop occurring.

Open Disk Utility (found in /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility) and select your hard drive from the list.  The very first screen you see should have a button marked &quot;Repair Permissions&quot;.  Clicking this will start an automated process that will check the existing permissions on each file, and compare it to what it should be, then try to change the permissions on that file if it is incorrect.  As the application does this, you may notice a lot of text scrolling in the window.  This is the application doing its work.  Once the process has finished, you should get a message stating if the repair was successful or not.  If successful, quit the application and see if the problems you have been experiencing still exist.

===Throwing the .plist===
Applications in OS X use something called plist to save the preferences. For example, when you start an application for the first time, it might ask you if it should look for updates when started and where you want your files to be saved. When you start the application next time, it will remember what you decided the first time. That information is saved in a plist file. Sometimes these files become corrupted, and that can lead to very odd problems like applications not starting and files not being saved correctly. Throwing the applications plist might fix this problem. (Throwing a plist file will not damage the application, but it will delete all your preferences and the application will act as if it's your first time using it the next time you start the application.)

The easiest way to throw a plist file is to search for the application in spotlight using the applications name and put .plist afterwards. For example, the plist for Mail is com.apple.mail.plist and the plist for iPhoto is com.apple.iPhoto.plist. From the spotlight menu, click &quot;Show All&quot; and right-click the plist file. Pick &quot;Reveal in Finder&quot; and a finder window should come up with the plist selected. Drag to the Desktop (and make sure that the plist is no longer in the folder you took it from). Start the application and see if it works better. If it doesn't, you can put the plist you put on the desktop back, that way you didn't lose your preferences for nothing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you use Font Book:

* First close all applications.
* Search for installed copies of the font with the Finder's Search and remove them from all system font files.
* Open the font with FontLab 4.5 or higher (or your own favorite font manipulation application). BTW: This doesn't work with all kinds of file formats.
* Choose from the File menu; Generate Font.
* From the popupwindow Font Format button, change 'FontLab' to 'OpenType-CFF' and save the file.
* By The Way: Do yourself a favour and choose a descriptive name, like TemplateGothicBold instead of temgotbol or something like that and avoid spaces. OS X doesn't have a problem with spaces, but a lot of others systems, like on the internet do. 
* Double-click the new .otf file and install it by clicking the button in the popup window.

Problem: When I type a certain character, the lead of that line - and that line height only - increases.&lt;br&gt;
Solution: This is caused by a lack of the typed charater in the font you are using. &lt;br&gt;

In this example, as soon as we type a eurosign, the line height increases, only in that line. The cause of this is the lack of a eurosign in the font we are using, the Templete Gothic. Flash MX 2004 tries to help out by putting in a eurosign from another font and this causes the difference in line height. Avoid this character, use a different font or recompile your font with eurosign in it.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Some Important Constructions== 

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===[[w:Closure_(topology)|Closure]]===
*  A point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''point of closure''' of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if for every neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U \cap A \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
* Define the '''closure''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be the intersection of all closed sets containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; (some authors use &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}&lt;/math&gt;). The closure has the nice property of being the smallest closed set containing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Each neighborhood (nbd) of every point in the closure intersects &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

===[[w:Interior_(topology)|Interior]]===
* We say that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an '''internal point'''  of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; [[w:iff|iff]] There is an open set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; U \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;
* Define the '''interior''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be the union of all open sets contained inside &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt; (some authors use &lt;math&gt;A^\circ&lt;/math&gt;). The interior has the nice property of being the largest open set contained inside &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Every point in the interior has a nbd contained inside &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

''Note that'' a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is Open [[w:iff|iff]] &lt;math&gt;A = Int(A)&lt;/math&gt;

===[[w:Exterior_(topology)|Exterior]]===

* Define the '''exterior''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be the union of all open sets contained inside the complement of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int} (X \setminus A)&lt;/math&gt;. It is the largest open set inside &lt;math&gt;X \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;. Every point in the exterior has a nbd contained inside &lt;math&gt;X \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;.

===[[w:Boundary_(topology)|Boundary]]===

* Define the '''boundary''' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)\setminus\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Bd}(A)&lt;/math&gt; (some authors prefer &lt;math&gt;\partial A&lt;/math&gt;). The boundary is also called the '''frontier'''. It is always closed since it is the intersection of the closed set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and the closed set &lt;math&gt;X\setminus\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. It can be proved that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is closed if it contains all its boundary, and is open if it contains none of its boundary. Every nbd of every point in the boundary intersects both &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X \setminus A&lt;/math&gt;. All boundary points of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are obviously points of contact of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

===[[w:Limit_point|Limit Points]]===

* A point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''limit point''' of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if for every neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(U\setminus\{x\}) \cap A \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. All limit points of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are obviously points of closure of the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

===Isolated Points===

* If a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math&gt;x\in S\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that &lt;math&gt;N\cap S = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, then x is called an '''isolated point.'''

===[[w:Density_(topology)|Density]]===
Definition: A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called dense if any point 
&lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, or if the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a limit point of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Definition: In a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is dense if &lt;math&gt;Cl(A)=X&lt;/math&gt;.
:Example: The set of rational numbers is dense in the set of real numbers.

Definition: In a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a set &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is nowhere dense if &lt;math&gt;Cl(A)&lt;/math&gt; has no nonempty open sets.
:Example: The set of natural numbers is nowhere dense in the set of real numbers.

Definition: Suppose ''X'' is a topological space. Then for &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, ''A'' is dense in ''X'' if &lt;math&gt;\bar{A} = X&lt;/math&gt;.

Definition: Suppose ''X'' is a topological space. Then for &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, ''A'' is nowhere dense in ''X'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;int (\bar{A}) = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

Definition: A ''G&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;'' set is a subset of a topological space that is a countable intersection of open sets.

Definition: An ''F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;'' set is a countable union of closed sets.

&lt;b&gt;Theorem&lt;/b&gt;

(''Hausdorff Criterion'') Suppose ''X'' has 2 topologies, ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. For each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, let B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; be a neighbourhood base for ''x'' in topology ''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and B&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; be a neighbourhood base for ''x'' in topology ''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then, &lt;math&gt;r_1\subseteq r_2&lt;/math&gt; if and only if at each &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; (B^1 \in B^1_x)(\exists (B^2 \in B^2_x)( B^2 \subseteq B^1).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Theorem&lt;/b&gt;

In any topological space, the boundary of an open set is closed and nowhere dense.

''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt; Let ''A'' be an open set in a topological space ''X''. Since ''A'' is open, int(''A'') = ''A''. Thus, σ''A'' ( or the boundary of ''A'') = &lt;math&gt;\bar{A}/   int (A) &lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt; \bar A/A =  \bar A \cap A^c &lt;/math&gt;. The complement of an open set is closed, and the closure of any set is closed. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\bar A \cap A^c &lt;/math&gt; is an intersection of closed sets and is itself closed. A subset of a topological space is nowhere dense if and only if the interior of its closure is empty. So, proceeding in consideration of the boundary of ''A''.

::::::::::The interior of the closure of the boundary of ''A'' is equal to the interior of the boundary of ''A''.
::::::::::Thus, it is equal to &lt;math&gt;int (\bar{A} \cap A^c)&lt;/math&gt;. 
::::::::::Which is also equal to &lt;math&gt;int (\bar{A}) \cap int (A^c)&lt;/math&gt;.
And, &lt;math&gt;int (A^c) = \bar{[(A^c)^c]}^c&lt;/math&gt;.
So, the interior of the closure of the boundary of ''A'' = &lt;math&gt;int (\bar{A}) \cap int \bar{(A^c)}&lt;/math&gt;., and as such, the boundary of ''A'' is nowhere dense.

==Types of Spaces==

We can also categorize spaces based on what kinds of points they have.

===[[w:Perfect space|Perfect Spaces]]===

*If a space contains no isolated points, then the space is a '''perfect space.'''

== Some Basic Results ==

*For every set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq \mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;. If a closed set &lt;math&gt;\alpha\supseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x\in\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)=\displaystyle\bigcap_{\alpha\subset X} \alpha&lt;/math&gt; for closed &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; we have &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt; being arbitrary, &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq \mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; be open. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x\in A\forall x\in U&lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)=\displaystyle\bigcup_{U\subseteq A}U&lt;/math&gt; for open &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;; we have &lt;math&gt;x\in \mathrm{Int}(A)\forall x\in U&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; being arbitrary, we have &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{int}(A)\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;


*A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is open if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)=A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; ''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\Longrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is open and &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt;. But we know that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)=A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\Longleftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;br /&gt; As &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a union of open sets, it is open (from definition of open set). Hence &lt;math&gt;A=\mathrm{Int}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is also open.


*A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is closed if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)=A.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt; Observe that the complement of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;X\setminus \mathrm{Cl}(A)=\mathrm{Int}(X\setminus A)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the required result is equivalent to the statement &quot;&lt;math&gt;X\setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is open if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(X\setminus A)=X\setminus A&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is closed implies that &lt;math&gt;X\setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is open, and hence we can use the previous property.  


*The closure &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is closed&lt;br /&gt; ''Proof:''&lt;br /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; be a closed set such that &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Now, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)= \displaystyle\bigcap_{\alpha\subset X}\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for closed &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. We know that the intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed, and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is closed.

#Prove the following identities for subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;:
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A\cup B)=\mathrm{Cl}(A)\cup\mathrm{Cl}(B)&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A\cap B)\subseteq\mathrm{Cl}(A)\cap\mathrm{Cl}(B)&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)\cup\mathrm{Int}(B)\subseteq\mathrm{Int}(A\cup B)&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A\cap B)=\mathrm{Int}(A)\cap\mathrm{Int}(B)&lt;/math&gt;
#Show that the following identities need not hold (i.e. give an exaple of a topological space and sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; for which they fail):
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}(A\cap B)=\mathrm{Cl}(A)\cap\mathrm{Cl}(B)&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Int}(A)\cup\mathrm{Int}(B)=\mathrm{Int}(A\cup B)&lt;/math&gt;
