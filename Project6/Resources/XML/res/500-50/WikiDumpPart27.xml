      <text xml:space="preserve">==C==
''looking for the story of C here''
===Type===
C is a full, procedural language.
===Execution Entry Point===
An executable starts with the main() method.
===General Syntax===
The typical statement is completed by a semi-colon.  For the assignment of b to a use:
 a = b;
===Comments===
Block comments are specified by a starting /* and ending */  They can span multiple lines.
 /*
  * this is a block comment 
  */
===Variable Declarations===
Declarations need to appear at the top of the scope.

Declare i as an integer: 
 int i;
Declare i as an integer and give it an initial value of 0:
 int i = 0;

===Method Declaration/Implementation===
Methods are declared by specifying the interface for the method.  

 return_type function_name(argument_1_type arg_1_name, 
                           argument_2_type arg_2_name);

Method implementation repeats much of the same information

 return_type function_name(argument_1_type arg_1_name, 
                           argument_2_type arg_2_name)
 {
     // work with arg_1_name, arg_2_name, and default_arg_name
     // depending on the argument types the variables are passed by 
     //   value, reference, or are constant
     // don't forget to return something of the return type
     return 36;
 }

===Scope===
Scope is defined by curly braces.
 { // this the the beginning of a scope
     // the scope is about to end
 }
===Conditional Statements===
If and only if A is equal to B assign C to D, otherwise, assign E to F.
 if( A == B )
 {
     D = C;
     // more code can be added here.  It is used if and only if A is equal to B
 }
 else
 {
     F = E;
     // more code can be added here.  It is used if and only if A is not equal to B
 }
or
 if( A == B ) 
     D = C; //more lines of code are not permitted after this statement
 else
     F = E;

Alternatively, a switch statement can be used for multiple choice operations.  This sample converts a number input to text.
 switch( number_value )
 {
     case 37:
         text = &quot;thirty-seven&quot;;
         break; // this line prevents the program from writing over this value with the
                //   following code
     case 23:
         text = &quot;twenty-three&quot;;
         break;
     default: // this is used if none of the previous cases contain the value
         text = &quot;unknown number&quot;;
 }

===Looping Statements===
This code counts from 0 to 9, adding up the contents of the array.
 int i = 0;
 for( int index = 0; index &lt; 10; index = index + 1 )
 {
     i = array[index];
 }

This code repeats until the number 4 is found.  If this runs off of the end of the array, there could be a problem.
 int index = 0;
 while( 4 != array[index] )
 {
     index = index + 1;
 }

This code increments the counter before the check is made, so that it starts with element 1.
 int index = 0;
 do
 {
     index = index + 1;
 }
 while( 4 != array[index] );
===Output Statements===
 printf( &quot;%s&quot;,&quot;Hello world!\n&quot; );

===Containers===
struct
===Algorithms===
Implement your own, or find a library.
===Garbage collection===
Garbage collection is manual.
===Physical Structure===
Generally, the interfaces are defined before the implementation in header files (often *.h) or above the implementation.  The implementation files are often named *.c.  Useful collections of classes can be compiled into libraries, often *.dll, *.a, or *.so, which can be compiled into executables (statically linked) or used on the fly (dynamically linked).
===Tips===
Don't confuse these two:
 =  // assignment
 == // comparison, is equal to
Often using the one you don't want will compile, and will produce results you did not expect.

A good practice is to write; if(CONSTANT == variable) rather than if(variable == CONSTANT) since the compiler will catch; if(CONSTANT = variable) but not if(variable = CONSTANT).

Use a compiler that generates lots of helpful warnings, even if the code is valid.  You could also / instead use a program such as 'lint'. This will help you avoid simple bugs such as the above-mentioned bug &quot;if ( x = 1 )&quot; instead of &quot;if ( x == 1 )&quot;.

Arrays start with index 0.

==Perceptual &quot;filling in&quot;==

Perceptual &quot;filling in&quot; occurs when visual properties such as textures, colours, brightness or motion are extended in the visual field to areas where they do not have corresponding events in the world. 

The filling in of the blind spot by the properties of the field in the contralateral eye has already been discussed. The part of the visual field represented by the blind spot is also &quot;filled in&quot; in the case of monocular vision.

[[Image:Constudblindill.png]]

Shut the right eye and focus on the pink cross with the left eye, if the head is moved towards the pink cross there is a point at which the yellow disk disappears but the white lines are still present. In this &quot;filling in&quot; the visual field does not appear to be distorted. 

Fiorani ''et al.'' (1992) developed a technique for probing the cortical blind spot using vertical and horizontal bar stimuli. Matsumoto &amp; komatsu (2005) used this technique on macaque monkeys.  In the monocular case they found that as a bar was moved across the visual field so that it crossed the blind spot there was a sudden change in neural activity in the deep layers of the neurons in the blind spot area of V1. When the bar was moved across the same part of the visual field of the contralateral eye the neural activity in the blind spot area increased steadily as the bar was moved. The authors found that there were neurons in the deep layers of blind spot cortex that had elongated receptive fields that could respond to stimuli outside the blind spot and transfer this activation into the blind spot cortex. 

Filling in of a slightly different type occurs in &quot;scotoma&quot;. In scotoma an area of the retina is damaged and unresonsive to visual stimuli, immediately after the damage patients report an area of visual field that is unresponsive to stimuli. After several months patients report that the area of field represented by the scotoma contains visual properties related to the physical world surrounding the area that would have formed an image on the scotoma. This results in a distortion of the visual field. (see for instance Gilbert(1993)). Direct measurements of activity in cortical area V1 show that the neurons that represented the area of the scotoma become sensitive to activity in the surrounding visual field. At the cortical level the scotoma is literally &quot;filled in&quot;.

There are many stimuli that cause &quot;filling in&quot;. These stimuli are known as &quot;illusions&quot; because they produce phenomenal experience that has no correlate in the world outside the body. In the &quot;neon colour spreading illusion&quot; a lightly coloured circle appears where there should be a white background. Sasaki and Watanabe (2004) used fMRI to show that the part of the topographic map in cortical area V1 corresponding to the light coloured circle was activated.

==Binocular Rivalry, Pattern Rivalry and Binocular Fusion==

Sir Charles Wheatstone (1838) was the first scientist to systematically investigate binocular rivalry. Binocular rivalry occurs when different images are presented to the left and right eyes. The subject sees successively one image, a combined image and then the other image. The swapping of images can take a second or more. Binocular rivalry is of interest in consciousness research because the parts of the brain that contain the dominant image should also be those parts that are contributing to conscious experience. Binocular rivalry involves at least two components; the first switches from one image to a merged image and then to the other image and the second permits the view to be part of conscious experience. 

[[Image:Constudrival.png]]

The switching of one image for another may involve selecting one of the images as the percept or selecting one of the eyes. Blake ''et al.'' (1979) performed an experiment in which subjects could change the image at a given eye by pressing a button. When a particular image became dominant they pressed a button to change the image at the eye receiving the dominant image for the non-dominant image. They found that the subjects immediately experienced the second image as the dominant image. This suggests that binocular rivalry is selecting between eyes rather than images. Lehky in 1988 proposed that the switching may be occurring as a result of feedback between visual cortical area V1 and the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (a thalamic relay - see Carandini ''et al.'' 2002) and Blake in 1989 also proposed that the switching occurred at the level of area V1. (Visual cortical area V1 receives visual input direct from the LGN.) 

Tong (2001) has argued that, in humans, the switching of images in binocular rivalry may occur at the earliest levels in the visual cortex. In particular, Tong and Engel (2001) used an elegant technique measuring the activity in the visual cortex that represents the blind spot of the eye to show that almost complete switching to the dominant image occurs at the level of visual cortical area V1. In support of this idea of switching at the level of V1 or even before the cortex, Kreimann ''et al.'' (2001, 2002) used direct electrode recordings in human cortex and found that the activity of most neurons changed with the percept. Other experiments have not shown a single locus in the brain where the suppressed sensory information gets switched out (Blake &amp; Logothetis 2002, Leopold &amp; Logothetis 1996, Gail et al., 2004).

Functional MRI has also shown cortical activity outside of sensory visual cortex related to both images in binocular rivalry. Lumer ''et al.'' (1998) found that only the fronto-parietal areas of cortex switched with the percept, Fang &amp; He (2005) found that activity relating to both suppressed and unsuppressed images were present in the dorsal stream of the visual system. Wunderlich ''et al.'' (2005) and Haynes ''et al.'' (2005) have both found suppression at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus using fMRI in humans.

Pasley ''et al.'' (2004) have shown that, even during suppression, fearful faces can produce activity in the amygdala (see Pessoa (2005) for a review).

Rivalry alternations seem to be the result of widespread activity changes that cover large parts of the brain, including but not necessarily originating at the earliest sensory stages of visual processing. &lt;!-- Full reference needed in reference section for this sentence: This is also reflected in several psychophysical results that are incompatible with eye-based suppression (see: Lee, 2004).--&gt; Most investigators have found that, once switching has occurred, there are areas of the brain that contain activity that is solely related to the percept but this varies from most of the cortex to largely more frontal regions depending upon the study. The most likely explanation for binocular rivalry is that the switching occurs at the level of the LGN as a result of feedback from the cortex.

Pattern Rivalry is also of interest in consciousness research for the same reasons as binocular rivalry. In pattern rivalry a figure may have two or more forms that replace each other. Typical examples of such figures are the Necker cube and Rubin's face-vase. The similarity of the time course of the switching between percepts in binocular rivalry and pattern rivalry has led many authors to suggest that these involve the same mechanism. Logothetis ''et al.'' (1996) used novel dichoptic stimuli (different images to each eyes) to produce a form of rivalry that seems to involve switching at levels in the cerebral cortex that are more distal to the sensory stimulus than V1. Leopold and Logothetis (1999), on the basis of their work with monkeys, state that &quot;..many neurons throughout the visual system, both monocular and binocular, continue to respond to a stimulus even when it is perceptually suppressed.&quot;. Kleinschmidt ''et al.'' (1998) investigated pattern rivalry with MRI and found activity in higher order visual areas during change of dominant pattern. Pettigrew (2001) also describes effects on rivalry due to thought and mood that may require involvement of large areas of cortex in the switching operation and stresses the way that V1 represents different visual fields in different hemispheres of the brain so that inter-hemispheric switching must also be considered.

It seems likely that the change of dominant pattern or percept is associated with higher level cortical activity but once the dominant percept is established many of the visually responsive neurons in the cortex are switched over to the new percept. This might account for the similarities in timing of binocular and pattern rivalry and the disparate results found by the various groups of authors. In the words of Kleinschmidt ''et al.'' (1998):

&quot;The transient activity fluctuations we found suggest that perceptual metastability elicited by ambiguous stimuli is associated with rapid redistributions of neural activity between separate specialized cortical and subcortical structures.&quot;

Which permits both the idea of selecting particular eyes or percepts, perhaps by feedback that switches a thalamic relay on the basis of cortical processing of patterns. Once the cortex has switched the thalamic relay most of the neurons in V1 would become exposed to the dominant percept but there would still be a few neurons in the cortical visual system receiving data from the non dominant image.

The investigations of binocular and pattern rivalry provide evidence that conscious visual experience is probably distal to V1 (i.e.: cortex or thalamus). 

Perceptual rivalry may be part of complex decision making rather than being simply a switch to blank out unwelcome input. It is clear from the Rubin face-vase that pattern rivalry is linked to recognition and would involve a complex delineation of forms within cortical processing. This would suggest that many areas of cortex should be involved before a particular percept is made dominant. Pettigrew (2001) argues that rivalry is the result of a complex phenomenon rather than being simply a switching event. Pettigrew's discovery that laughter abolishes rivalry also points to a complex cortical system for switching percepts. Pettigrew proposes that complex cortical processes control rivalry and that the actual switching of percepts is performed sub-cortically in the Ventral Tegmental Area. He concludes his review of the problem by noting that &quot;Rivalry may thus reflect fundamental aspects of perceptual decision making..&quot; Pettigrew (2001).

Another effect, known as &quot;binocular fusion&quot;, provides further compelling evidence for the non-conscious nature of the cerebral cortex. In binocular fusion images from both eyes are fused together to create a single image in experience. Moutoussis and Zeki (2002) used a form of binocular fusion in which images of faces were flashed at 100ms intervals to both eyes simultaneously. When both eyes received images of the same colour the subject could see the faces but when one eye received a green image on a red background and the other a red image on a green background the subjects reported seeing a uniform yellow field that contained no faces. 

fMRI scans of the subject's brains showed that when both eyes were exposed to images of the same colour the part of the brain that deals with faces was active and when each eye received images of different colours the same areas of brain showed activity. In other words the cortex contained strong activity related to faces whether or not faces were experienced. Moutoussis and Zeki found a similar effect when they used images of houses instead of images of faces. The authors concluded that: &quot;The present study further suggests that there are no separate processing and perceptual areas but rather that the same cortical regions are involved in both the processing and, when certain levels of activation are reached and probably in combination with the activation of other areas as well, the generation of a conscious visual percept&quot;. 

This conclusion does not seem to be supported by the data. There is no evidence that any area of cortex contains the percept itself. The experiment shows that the cortex contains data relating to both red and green faces which suggests that the cortex is not the site of the conscious percept. The percept is most likely distal to the cortex perhaps in the thalamus or some other area that receives cortical sensory output.

It is interesting that Fries ''et al.'' (1997) found that neurons that were activated by the dominant image in binocular rivalry fired synchronously whereas those that were activated by the non-dominant image did not. Thalamocorticothalamic oscillations are the most likely source for synchronising neurons over whole areas of cortex, suggesting that the conscious percept is located in the thalamus rather than the cortex.

==Synchronisation of Neural Processes==

Our experience seems to contain entities with their attributes attached to them at the correct places in space and time. When a dog barks we see its jaws open at the same time as the bark and both jaws and bark are at the same location. We take this for granted but the brain must be engaging in some complex processing to achieve this synchronised and appropriately positioned set of objects and events. The illustration below shows the two basic processes that might be used to synchronise events between the different specialised processors in the cerebral cortex and brain in general.

[[Image:Constudsynch.gif]]

In the first option a complete model of sensation, dream etc. may be created and then allowed to become part of conscious experience. In the second model events are released into experience as fast as possible but are synchronous when recalled, having been synchronised in a storage buffer. There is a third option in which there is no synchronisation of events so that the output from different processors would occur at different times.

The 'experience buffer' would be a volume of brain in which a succession of events could be recorded. The buffer might either be updated in steps, the previous content being discarded, or continuously updated with the oldest content being lost continuously.

In the first option events from different processes would always appear to be simultaneous unless the experience buffer were updated as a series of steps in which case any changes at around the moment of updating might appear in successive buffers. For instance, if change of position were processed before change in colour a circle on a screen that changed from green to red at the start of a motion might seem to be briefly green during the motion and then turn red.

In the second model events from different processors might appear asynchronous at the moment of experience but synchronous when recalled.

Colour vision and motion vision are processed in different parts of the visual cortex and in distinct parts of visual cortical areas V1 and V2. They are different processes and hence ideal for studying the synchronisation of cortical activity. Moutoussis and Zeki (1997) presented subjects with moving coloured squares on a computer screen that changed from red to green or vice versa as they changed direction of movement. It was found that subjects seemed to perceive changes in colour some 70-80 msecs before they perceived a change in the direction of motion of the squares. Further work by Arnold ''et al.'' (2001) and Arnold and Clifford (2001) have confirmed that colour changes seem to be perceived before motion. Arnold and Clifford (2001) also found a quantitative relationship between the colour/motion asynchrony and the direction of change of motion, complete reversals of direction giving rise to the greatest asynchrony between the detection of colour and motion changes. 

Moutoussis and Zeki (1997) conclude by stating that the asynchrony of neural processes shows that &quot;..the perception of each attribute is solely the result of the activity in the specialised system involved in its processing..&quot;. It seems more likely that the experiments simply show that slow neural processes are not synchronised before they become percepts (the third option above). The experiments are excellent evidence for the concept of the cortex as a set of specialised processors that deliver their output asynchronously to some other place where the output becomes a percept. 

These experiments on colour and motion suggest that there is no synchronisation between the processes that deal with these two aspects of vision. Another set of experiments by Clifford ''et al.'' (2003) supports this idea of processing being asynchronous. They asked subjects to perform a variety of judgements of when visual events occurred and found that the degree of synchrony of one visual event with another depends on the type of judgement. Different judgements probably use processors in different areas of cortex and the output from these arrives asynchronously at the part of the brain that supports the percept. 

When the percept is formed there must be feedback to the cortical processes that create its content. Otherwise it would not be possible to report about the percept and the cortex would be unable to direct processing to the percept in preference to other, non-conscious cortical data.

Although slow processes (20 milliseconds to 1 second) do not seem to be synchronised there is some evidence for very rapid synchronisation. Andrews ''et al.'' (1996) revisited a problem raised by the famous physiologist Charles Sherrington. Sherrington considered the phenomenon of 'flicker fusion' in which a flickering light appears to be a continuous steady light if it flashes on and off at frequencies of about 45 Hz or higher. He reasoned that if the images from both eyes are brought together to form a single image then the frequency at which a flickering light appears to be steady should depend on whether one or two eyes are used. Flicker fusion should occur if each eye receives alternate flashes at only half the normal flicker fusion frequency. The flicker should disappear if the left eye receives flashes at 23 pulses per second and the right eye receives alternate flashes at 23 pulses per second. When Sherrington performed the experiment he found that this was not the case, using approximate figures, each eye required 46 pulses per second for fusion to occur. Sherrington proposed that the flicker fusion in alternate binocular presentation was occurring &quot;psychically&quot;, outside of normal physiological processes.

Andrews ''et al.'' duplicated Sherrington's result but investigated it further. They found that when lights were flashed in each eye alternately at low frequences (2 Hz) the experience was the same as a light being flashed in both eyes at this rate. At frequencies of four Hz and higher the subjects began to report that the lights being flashed alternately in both eyes seemed to flicker at the same rate as lights being flashed in both eyes at half the frequency. It seemed as if a flash in one eye followed by a flash in the other eye was being perceived as a single flash or &quot;conflated&quot; as the authors put it. The authors explained this effect by suggesting that the brain activity corresponding to the flashes was sampled for a short period and any number of flashes occurring during this period became perceived as a single flash. The maximum rate of sampling would be about 45 Hz. This idea is similar to option (1) above, where the buffer is filled and emptied 40 - 50 times a second. 

An experience buffer that is refreshed at 40-50 times a second might also explain the results obtained with colour and motion asynchrony because synchronisation between processes may well happen too quickly to affect processes that occur at very slow rates. Singer and Gray (1995), Singer (2001) have proposed that synchronisation between neurones at about 45Hz is the discriminator between those neurones with activity that contributes to conscious experience and activity in other neurones. A rapid refresh rate in a sychronising buffer agrees with the results found by Fries ''et al.'' (1997) in which visual cortical neurones that represent a percept underwent synchronous oscillations in the gamma frequency range (39-63 Hz). Tononi ''et al.'' (1998) have also found synchronisation of neural activity in neurones that represent the percept.

The gamma frequency oscillations are intrinsic to the cortex but are triggered by the thalamus and are part of the 'arousal system'.  Readers should be wary of the term 'arousal system' because it evokes the idea of something waking up a conscious cortex.  The cortex can be fully active during sleep and even during pathological unconsciousness such as persistent vegetative state so it is possible that the arousal centres themselves or nearby structures actually host phenomenal consciousness.

==EEG and synchronisation==

If electrodes are placed on the scalp varying electrical potentials of a few tens of microvolts can be recorded between the electrodes. Recordings of potentials from electrodes on the scalp are known as electroencephalograms (EEGs).

The potentials recorded in the EEG are due to postsynaptic potentials in nerve cells. The EEG is insensitive to the activity of single cells and occurs as a result of relatively slow, '''synchronised''', changes in large areas of cells.  The differences in potential between two scalp electrodes are largely due to depolarisation and hyperpolarisation of the dendritic trees of cortical pyramidal cells. The folding of the cortex (gyri) is problematical for recording and interpreting EEGs because opposing layers of cortex can cancel any net potentials.

The EEG shows rhythmic activity.  This is conventionally divided into the following frequency bands:

Delta waves 0-4 Hz

Theta waves 4-8 Hz

Alpha waves 8-12 Hz

Beta waves &gt;10 Hz

Gamma waves (also called fast beta) 25-100 Hz

EEGs also contain short bursts of activity called spindles and very fast oscillations (VFOs). Spindles last for 1-2 seconds and contain rhythmic activity at 7-14 Hz. They are associated with the onset of sleep. The VFOs consist of short bursts at frequencies of over 80 Hz.

When the eyes are closed the amplitude of activity from most pairs of electrodes is increased compared with when the eyes are open.  When subjects are awake the EEG consists mainly of alpha and beta activity with considerable low amplitude gamma when the eyes are open. In stage 1 sleep the EEG consists of theta waves, in stage 2 sleep of varied activity and spindles, in stage 4 sleep of delta and during REM sleep of beta and theta activity. In epileptic seizures there tends to be high amplitude activity with pronounced synchronisation between many pairs of electrodes.

The rhythmic electrical activity is due to cortical feedback loops, cortico-cortical synchronisation, thalamic pacemakers and thalamo-cortical synchronisation. VFOs have been attributed to the activity of electrical connections between cells (dendro-dendritic gap junctions) (Traub (2003)).

The gamma activity, centred on a frequency of 40 Hz appears to be related to activity in cortical interneurons that form electrical connections between their dendrites  (Tamas ''et al.'' 2000).  These oscillations can be triggered by high frequency stimulation of the posterior intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus  (Barth and MacDonald 1996, Sukov and Barth 2001)  and as a result of activation of the reticular system (Munk ''et al.'' 1996).  This suggests that stimulation of cortex by thalamic sensory relays triggers gamma band activity in the cortex. A shift from gamma to beta waves can occur in human event related potentials after about 0.2 secs (Pantev 1995, Traub ''et al.'' 1999).

The alpha activity is related to thalamic pacemakers, perhaps as a result of intrinsic oscillatory activity in thalamic sensory relays (see Roy &amp; Prichep 2005 for a brief review). Theta activity, which occurs during some cognitive tasks and mental arithmetic involves a loop from the cortex to the non-specific thalamic nuclei. Delta activity seems to be endogenous to cortex when input is suppressed during sleep. Beta activity is due to cortico-cortical interactions, often after a brief period of gamma activation. It should be noted that gamma and beta activity can be expressed as impulses in cortico-thalamic pathways and that when cortical and thalamic activity is correlated there is a conscious state. In other words gamma or beta waves in the cortex are not correlates of consciousness on their own - see for instance Laureys ''et al.'' (2002).

==Event related potentials==

After a sudden event there are a characteristic set of changes in EEG activity known as '''event related potentials''' or ERPs. The time course of the ERP is shown in the diagram below.

[[Image:Constudevent.png]]

ERPs occur in response to novel stimuli and are also produced by brief transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)(Iramina ''et al.'' 2002). The slow component is known as the P3 or P300 phase of the ERP. It is due to activation of areas of the brain that are relatively remote from the primary sensory areas of brain. 

Nieuwenhuis ''et al.'' (2005) have reviewed the origin of the P300 ERP: &quot;To summarize, convergent evidence suggests that P3-like activity can be recorded in several, widely separated brain areas. These include some medial temporal and subcortical structures (e.g., the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and thalamus), but these structures are unlikely to contribute directly to the scalp-recorded P3.&quot;. According to Nieuwenhuis ''et al.'' (2005) the recorded P300 may be due to temporo-parietal and prefrontal cortical activity. Linden (2005) has also concluded that widespread, but specific, cortical activation is correlated with the recorded P300 ERP.

The generator of the P300 is still obscure. Nieuwenhuis ''et al.'' (2005) consider that the Locus coeruleus, a nucleus in the pons that regulates task related attention and part of the sleep-wake cycle, may be responsible. In line with this, Mashour ''et al.'' (2005) have discovered that TMS induced P300 activity is reduced in unconscious states. 

Whether the P300 is related to Libet's 0.5 second delay is still obscure but the discovery that the P300 occurs in association with subliminal stimuli (stimuli that do not enter awareness)(Bernat ''et al.'' 2001) suggests that it is associated with non-conscious cortical processing. Williams ''et al.'' (2004), in an investigation of subliminal and supraliminal fear perception, found that &quot;conscious fear perception was distinguished by a more prominent N4, peaking around 400 msec&quot;; the N4 component follows the P300 component in the succession of phases of the ERP. Williams ''et al.'' considered that the earlier phases in the ERP are probably related to non-conscious processing. In contrast Vogel ''et al.'' (1998) found that suppression of the P300 was associated with suppression of awareness.

==The integration delay==

Psychological experiments often involve binary decisions where subjects give one of two outputs in response to stimuli.  It is found that if the stimuli are made increasingly noisy or complex the response time tends to increase. Psychophyicists have developed various mathematical models to explain the increased response times due to noise such as the Integrator and Accumulator models (cf: Luce(1986)). These models have been fairly successful when explaining experiments such as judging the net direction of movement of sets of dots on a screen when the dots are given semi-random paths and different brightness etc. In these circumstances it can take up to 2 seconds for an accurate decision.

There are many tasks however where the accuracy of decision making does not improve after about 300 milliseconds. The accuracy of the performance of rats when choosing between two alternatives when reacting to odours peaks at about 300 ms (Uchida and Mainen(2003), Abraham ''et al.'' (2004)). The accuracy of humans when performing vernier acuity tasks, line detection, contrast sensitivity, motion velocity discrimination and stereoscopic depth discrimination seems to peak at 300ms (Uchida ''et al.'' 2006).

Uchida, Kepecs and Mainen (2006) suggest that &quot;rapid and short integration time is a sensible strategy for rapid processing of low-level sensory information in order to form more complex sensory images, both in vision and olfaction.&quot;  Whether these authors regard these derived sensory images as the content of consciousness is not mentioned. The authors propose that the 300ms optimal integration time may be partly due to the mechanics of sniffing (a sniff takes about 125-200ms) and the nature of optical fixation (inter-saccade intervals are typically 200-400 ms ). The authors note that the animal or human could, in principle, choose to integrate over longer intervals but if it is moving this may not lead to information that is current for changed circumstances.

An optimal processing time of about 300 ms would be consistent with the delays observed before conscious awareness occurs in response to a stimulus - an interval required to form &quot;more complex sensory images&quot;.

==Global Workspace Theory==

Global Workspace Theory is the idea that somewhere in the brain there is a facility that integrates the processes that occur in the various separate areas of the brain.  The theory was first proposed by Descartes as the ''sensus communis'', the common sense, but the modern form of the theory dispenses with the idea of a point soul looking at the brain. In modern Global Workspace theory it is proposed that an area of brain receives input from most of the cerebral cortex and broadcasts its outputs to all of the unconscious modular information processors in the brain.

Modern Global Workspace Theory has been championed by Baars (1983, 1988).

There is increasing evidence for a Global Workspace or Global Workspaces in the brain. Much of this evidence comes from fMRI, single unit and magnetoencephalography studies in which it is shown that non-conscious or subliminal processing mainly occupies primary, sensory cortex whereas conscious processing occupies large areas of cerbral cortex.

In binocular rivalry the stimulus that is consciously perceived is responsible for relatively intense activation of large areas of brain whereas the non-conscious stimulus is often suppressed (see above and Sheinberg &amp; Logothetis (1997), Tononi ''et al.'' (1998)). The suppression is likely to occur in the Lateral Geniculate Nuclei which suggests a role for the Thalamic Reticular Nuclei, which modulate LGN activity, in the control of the percept. 

===Masking and visual awareness===

Word masking has also been used to investigate the idea of a Global Workspace. When a word is presented on its own for a few tens of milliseconds it remains readable but if it is immediately succeeded by, or accompanied by, another word it becomes indistinct or invisible. This effect is known as &quot;word masking&quot;. Vogel ''et al.'' (1998) have investigated a version of word masking known as the &quot;attentional blink&quot;. They found that when stimuli became invisible the P3 component of the Event Related Potential, which peaks at around 300-500 millisecs after a stimulus, was completely suppressed. The P3 component of the ERP has been related to the lodging of data in working memory and also to gamma band activity in the EEG.  This strongly suggests the involvement of a cortico-thalamic loop in the &quot;attentional blink&quot;. The delay of 0.3 to 0.5 secs is typical of the time required for conscious awareness (see above).

Word masking in conjunction with fMRI and Event Related Potential (ERP) recordings has been used by Dehaene ''et al.'' (2001) to expose control by a central mechanism.  It was found that masked words activate mainly the visual cortex and ventral stream (inferior temporal lobe) whereas visible words also activated distant parietal, prefrontal and cingulate sites.

Dehaene ''et al.'' (2003)  and found that the dynamics of the loss of visibility of words in an attentional blink experiment could be modelled by a simulated cortico-thalamic loop. In their simulation a distributed cortical process determined which events would receive attention and the system used the thalamic gating systems to exclude those that did not receive attention. 

Tse ''et al.'' (2005) have used purely visual stimuli in masking experiments and concluded that, in the case of purely visual stimuli, the neural correlates of awareness were limited to the occipital cortex:

&quot;We suggest that there are both lower and upper bounds within the visual hierarchy for the processing of visual masking and the maintenance of visual awareness of simple unattended targets; the lower bound is at least as high as the border between V2 and V3, and the upper bound is within the occipital lobe, possibly somewhere downstream of V4.&quot;

This discovery would mean that activation of large areas of cortex are unnecessary for awareness.

Melloni ''et al.'' (2007) compared compared the electrophysiological responses related to the processing of visible and invisible words in a delayed matching to sample task. Both perceived and nonperceived words caused a similar increase of local (gamma) oscillations in the EEG, but only perceived words induced a transient long-distance synchronization of gamma oscillations across widely separated regions of the brain. After this transient period of temporal coordination, the electrographic signatures of conscious and
unconscious processes continue to diverge. Only words reported as perceivedinduced (1) enhanced theta oscillations over frontal regions during the maintenance interval, (2) an increase of the P300 component of the  event-related potential, and (3) an increase in power and phase synchrony of gamma oscillationsbefore the anticipated presentation of the test word. We propose that the
critical process mediating the access to conscious perception is the earlytransient global increase of phase synchrony of scillatory activity in the gammafrequency.

===Attention and the global workspace===

Baars (2002) in his review of evidence for the Global Workspace Theory quotes many other experiments that show activation of larger areas of cortex in response to conscious stimuli compared with unconscious or subliminal stimuli.The effect is also seen in change blindness, learning and attention.  Newman and Baars (1993) consider that the &quot;workspace&quot; is fairly global in the brain: 

&quot;This Neural Global Workspace (NGW) model views conscious processes in terms of a globally integrative brain system. The neural circuitry contributing to this system is not only widely distributed across the neocortex, but includes key corticothalamic and midbrain circuits as well. These cortico-subcortical circuits are hypothesized to be critical to understanding the mechanisms of attentional control that provide an essential basis for the conscious processing of information&quot;. 

However they focus particularly on the role of the thalamic Reticular Nucleus and cortico-thalamic connectivity in the control of attention.

Other ideas for the location of the Global Workspace are the idea of Singer et al. that gamma synchrony controls access to the content of consciousness and  Llinas et al. (1998) that the thalamus is the hub through which communication occurs between areas of cortex.

One of the problems with Global Workspace theory is that it suggests that attention, working memory, cognitive control and consciousness may all be in the same area of the brain.  It is likely that the mechanisms of attention, working memory, and cognitive control may involve several, interlinked systems perhaps co-opting the basal ganglia in the process. In view of this Maia and Cleeremans (2005) propose that &quot;.. attention, working memory, cognitive control and consciousness are not distinct functions implemented by separate brain systems. Attempting to find separate neural correlates for each may therefore be the wrong approach. Instead, we suggest that they should be understood in terms of the dynamics of global competition, with biasing from PFC (prefrontal cortex).&quot;.  The inclusion by Maia and Cleeremans of consciousness with distributed attention, working memory and cognitive control is reminiscent of Zeki &amp; Bartel's idea of microconsciousness.

It should be noted that, in common with Libet's data, the percept seems to be available to phenomenal consciousness some 0.3 to 0.5 secs after a stimulus; this suggests that whatever determines the content of phenomenal consciousness operates before events become part of phenomenal consciousness. This relegates phenomenal consciousness from being a controller of attention to being the recipient of content that is the subject of attention.  This finding is consistent with the philosophical problem of the '''apparently''' epiphenomenal nature of phenomenal consciousness. 

Given the data on the timing of conscious awareness it seems that there may be two &quot;workspaces&quot;, an active workspace that models the world, discarding and suppressing data during rivalry, and a passive workspace that receives the final, edited product. The active workspace would correlate with the cortical systems stressed by Dehaene ''et al.'' and Maia and Cleermans although, given the results of Tse et al., the workspace would be limited to small zones of cortex.  The loading of the passive workspace with the output of the active workspace would correlate with thalamo-cortical activity during component P3 of the ERP in which data is transferred from the cortex to the thalamus. This workspace might constitute the source for reports of the content of phenomenal consciousness. 

Llinas ''et al.'' (1998) have proposed two parallel cortico-thalamic attentional systems, one of which is related to the thalamic specific nuclei and the other to the thalamic non-specific nuclei, especially the ILN. The non-specific system would be related to consciousness itself.

==The &quot;cognitive map&quot; and the neural basis of perceptual space==

Our bodies appear to be mobile within a constant space. We walk around a room; the room does not rotate around us. The constancy of the location of things gives us the feeling that we are directly viewing a constant world. But how does the brain provide a constant world rather than a world that rotates with the movement of the sense organs? Why is our view of the world when we move our eyes so different from the disturbing flow of images that occur when a video camera is waved around? Do our brains contain a constant &quot;cognitive map&quot; (O'Keefe and Nadel 1978) of our surroundings?

Mittelstaedt &amp; Mittelstaedt (1980, 1982) discovered that female gerbils were able to recover their pups in darkened surroundings by searching in a semi random fashion on the outbound journey and then proceeding directly back to the nest on the inbound journey. The direct journey back to the nest seemed to be due to an integration of the various directions taken on the outward journey ('''path integration'''). If the equipment being explored by the mother gerbil was rotated very slowly the mother would make an error equivalent to the amount of rotation. More rapid rotations that activated the vestibular system of the rat (acceleration measurement) did not cause errors in navigation. This demonstration that rodents could navigate accurately on the basis of '''idiothetic''' cues (cues that are due to internal senses) led to research on the neural basis of the navigation. 

As early as 1971 O'Keefe and Dostrovsky had discovered that there are particular cells in the hippocampus that fire according to the position of an animal in the environment. This has been complimented by research that showed that changes in visual cues within the environment caused changes in the firing rate of place cells in hippocampal area CA3 (.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Theories of Consciousness==
Some recent scientific theories of consciousness are tabulated below. The extent to which they account for the phenomenon of consciousness is shown.

It is remarkable that many of the theories are consistent with one another.  As in the tale of the 'blind men and the elephant' some of the theories seem to describe the trunk, some the tail etc. but they all seem to be part of the same elephant! The convergence of the theories is shown in the illustration below:

== Conversion ==

A solar cell converts light directly into electricity using the “Photovoltaic Effect”.  There is no fuel, steam or thermodynamics involved.  When light hits a solar cell, it instantly produces electricity.  Solar cells today do not store electricity.  In other words, when the light is taken away from the cell, it stops producing electricity.  It is very common to store the electricity from a solar cell in a battery.

You can store electricity generated from a solar panel in a battery such as a typical car battery or you could use a Deep Cycle battery for more storage capacity. Typical car batteries are not recommended for use in solar power systems.  They have a very small range of operating voltage and if discharged too deeply, the battery will be irrepairably damaged.  Deep cycle batteries have a wider operating voltage range and are more suitable for use in solar power systems. If you are using a large solar panel to charge your battery, it would be wise to purchase a charge controller to regulate the current flow.

Once the battery is charged you can connect an inverter to the terminals. Connect the negative terminal first. An inverter will convert the battery's DC current to usable AC current which you can use to power AC appliances.

== Ac vs Dc ==

AC and DC voltage waveforms.  Alternating Current (AC) is the type of electricity found in the outlet in your home.  DC Direct Current is what you would find in the outlet of your car.  DC electricity is also the type of electricity stored in batteries.  Generators at big power plants use rotating alternators to produce AC electricity while the dynamo found in your bicycle (still a rotating machine) produces DC.   Solar Cells only produce DC electricity and their excess power output is most readily stored in deep cycle batteries.  In order to run most appliances in your home, you will need to use a power inverter which changes the DC voltage to AC.  Invertors range in size from the very small 50 watts all the way up to 5Kw.  You should consider what appliances and equipment you intend to run off your power inverter.  Cheaper power inverters will typically use a square wave output signal to create the AC voltage.  More sensitive equipment such as computers will require pure sine wave outputs.  Pure sine wave power inverters are typically more expensive.

Temperature can be an interesting parameter to measure. The temperature of the surroundings might not be very useful for a mobile robot, the temperature of a motor or battery back is.

==What is temperature?==
&quot;Temperature: A measure proportional to the average translational kinetic energy associated with the disordered microscopic motion of atoms and molecules. The flow of heat is from a high temperature region toward a lower temperature region.&lt;ref&gt;
-Courtesy of the references cited below but mostly based on the operational definition on the HyperPhysics pages at Georgia State University by R. Nave. and the discussion in &quot;Traceable Temperatures&quot; Second Ed. by Nicholas and White-See the discussions and definitions below for our rationale.&quot; Note, the Hyperphysics page is located at: [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/temper.html#c1]
From the page at [About Temperature Sensors entitled &quot;What is Temperature&quot; (http://www.temperatures.com/wit.html) ].
Permission to reproduce this definition has been granted by its author and the webpage copyright holder.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Units and their conversions==
The most used units for temperature are Degrees Celsius, Kelvin, and Degrees Fahrenheit .

===Degrees Celsius===
This temperature scale is defined around water. It defines 0°C as the temperature on which water freezes at standard atmospheric pressure. 100°C is defined as the temperature at which water boils.

'''Conversion:''' 
:To Fahrenheit: Tc * 9/5 +32
:To Kelvin: Tc + 273,15

===Kelvin===
Kelvin is a temperature scale with one defined temperature: 0 Kelvin is the lowest possible temperature, which is about -273,15°C. An increase of 1 Kelvin has the same size as an increase of 1°C.&lt;BR&gt;
The Kelvin (note it's not '''degrees''' Kelvin) temperature scale is used in science and engineering, most formulas containing temperature require Kelvin, unless it involves temperature differences, then one can use both Celsius and Kelvin as the difference between 10 and 20 Kelvin and between 10 and 20°Celsius are equal. 

'''Conversion:'''
:To Fahrenheit: Tk *9/5 -459,67
:To Celsius: Tk - 273,15

===Fahrenheit===
This scale uses the lowest temperate that could be measured at the time when this scale was developed and the temperature of the human body. The first temperature is defined as 0°F the latter as 100°F. This places 0°C at 32°F and 100°C at 212°F. A difference of 1°F isn't the same size as a difference of 1°C.

'''Conversion:'''
:To Kelvin: (Tf + 459,67) * 5/9
:To Celsius: (Tf - 32) * 5/9

==Methods of measuring temperatures==

===Non-electric methods===
''Are any of these non-electric methods useful for robotics?''

The old fashioned way to measure temperature uses the expansion of mercury in a glass capillary tube. Newer thermometers use other liquids like alcohol.
Other methods use two thin metal strips with different thermal expansion rates fused together and are called bimetal or bimetallic.

Yet another way uses the expansion of gas or liquid or a gas-liquid combination in a closed metal capillary tube system, called gas thermometers and filled systems.
Other ways use the change of phase of some materials, such as paints and pastes whereby their reflectivity or color changes permanently when a specific temperature is reached. These are often called temperature or thermal paints and labels.

Another method uses the variation in reflectivity of certain liquid crystals with temperature.
One of the original thermometers, named after Galileo, uses several precision weights in labeled small glass globes, of known volume, all placed in a vertical cylinder of liquid like water, sufficient in size to allow all the globes to fit and with sufficient width to enable the globes to move freely past one another. As the temperature of the assembly changes, the density of the water changes and the globes assume differing heights in the cylinder according to their density with the globe in the highest position indicating the temperature to be at or below its labeled value.&lt;p&gt;

===Electric or thermoelectric methods===
====Thermocouples====
Thermocouples consist of a pair of wires of different metals connected together at both ends and insulated but kept thermally close to each other over their length. When they encounter a temperature gradient form one end to the other, an electrical current flows through the circuit due to the Seebeck Effect. If one of the wires is opened and the voltage between the open ends is measured with a suitably high impedance voltmeter, a voltage nearly equal to the average relative Seebeck coefficient times the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends will be measured.

Thermoelectric properties of many material combinations have been developed over the past hundred years or so and also have been standardized for several of them, more commonly known by their ISA letter designations, as standard. Their electrical outputs for cold end reference temperature at 32 Deg F and 0 deg C are widely published in ASTM Standard E230. Many sources on the web provide these tabular values including the National Institute for Science &amp; Technology (NIST) in the USA.

====Temperature sensitive resistors====
Many electrically conductive materials have a resistance that varies with temperature -- they are temperature sensitive resistors.

There are two generic types of temperature sensitive resistors: Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC) devices and Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) devices.

Usually the PTC devices, if made of metal, are termed Resistance Temperature Detectors or RTDs. Ones made from other materials are usually called Thermistors, short for Thermal Resistors.

RTDs are a highly developed technology worldwide and several international standards exist for the most widely used type, those made of pure Platinum. They are usually called Platinum Resistance Thermometers, or simple PRTs. Very special PRTs are used as interpolating devices in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90), these and similar devices sold commercially are often known as Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometers, or SPRTs.

Tables for the most commonly used RTD materials, Platinum, Nickel and Copper, can be found in several International and national standards as well as many locations on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.temperatures.com/rtds.html &quot;Temperatures.com: Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs)&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermistors are also very highly developed, but there are no uniform standards for their properties. Each supplier makes their own products and provide their own calibration tables. Some of these tables have been cataloged on the measurement database website.&lt;ref&gt;
http://measurementdb.com/
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular thermistors are manufactured using material with a B of 3300 K or a material with a B of 5133 K or some other material with an intermediate value.

Independent of the material, most thermistors are manufactured such that the resistance at room temperature (298.15 K = 25 °C) is one of these [[Wikipedia: preferred value| preferred value]]s: 1 k&amp;Omega;, 2 k&amp;Omega;, 5 k&amp;Omega;, 10 k&amp;Omega;, 20 k&amp;Omega;, 50 k&amp;Omega;, 100 k&amp;Omega;, 200 k&amp;Omega;, 500 k&amp;Omega;, 1 M&amp;Omega;.

* [[PBASIC Programming/RCTIME]] and [http://reprap.org/wiki/ExtruderIO &quot;RepRap: ExtruderIO&quot; ] have more details on measuring the RC time constant of a capacitor + thermistor circuit; then from that time calculating the temperature.
* [[Embedded Systems/Low-Voltage Circuits]] and [http://reprap.org/wiki/thermistor &quot;RepRap: Thermistor&quot;] have more details on measuring the output voltage of a &quot;resistor divider&quot; resistor + thermistor circuit; then from that voltage calculating the temperature.

====Semiconductor====
Semiconductors, such as diodes and transistors have properties that vary greatly with the temperature. This arises from the temperature sensitivity of the bandgap in such devices which is highly repeatable and very stable, especially in Silicon semiconductors. 

Several Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturers, such as Analog Devices, Dallas Semiconductors and National Semiconductors manufacture many variants of the basic diode temperature sensors with additional circuitry to scale the output for use with simple digital display meters.

====Radiation Thermometer &amp; Optical Pyrometer====

The popular ear thermometer and low cost &quot;laser&quot; thermometer of today are variants of the radiation thermometer (pyrometer) that began its development in the 19th Century. The devices are all based on the thermal radiation properties of literally everything in nature, whether it be gas, liquid or solid. The physical processes at work inside all materials includes emission of electromagnetic radiation that is a function of the temperature and optical properties of an object.

The physical emission of thermal radiation was first described correctly by Max Planck in the last year of the 19th Century. His theory led to the quantum revolution in Physics. It has stood the test of time as an accurate and reliable theory of thermal emission of radiation and enables instrument designers to develop instruments that can measure temperature without contacting the object that is being measured with remarkable levels of accuracy and repeatability. There are very few standards for such devices.&lt;ref&gt;The only radiation thermometer standards of which we are aware are described on the webpage: INFRARED RADIATION THERMOMETER and THERMAL IMAGER STANDARDS [http://www.temperatures.com/stds-rts.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ability to measure pressure is very beneficial to the subject of robotics. The density of the atmosphere changes with altitude. If the air pressure is known then the altitude can then be established.
If the robot contains fluids under pressure (for example, hydraulic systems), pressure sensors can be used to detect faults in the system. Pressure sensors can also be installed in a compressed tank of gas to measure the amount of gas left.

==Measuring Pressure==
                                   
===Analogue Methods===
[[Image:Manometer_104026.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A Bourdon gauge]]
A Bourdon gauge uses a coiled tube which causes a rotation of an arm connected to the tube as it expands due to pressure increase. However, this is not particularly useful in Robotics unless you design a way to get voltage to vary with respect to needle displacement.

[[Image:Strain gauge.svg|thumb|Typical foil strain gauge.  The gauge is far more sensitive to strain in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction.  The markings outside the active area help to align the gauge during installation.]]

===Electric Methods===
* Resistive (Strain Gauge) - As the object is deformed, the foil is deformed, causing its electrical resistance to change. This resistance change, usually measured using a Wheatstone bridge, is related to the strain by the quantity known as the gauge factor.  Foil strain gauges are only useful to detect large pressure changes and are not very precise over small changes.

* Capacitive - The deflection of the piston is often one half of a capacitor, so that when the piston moves, the capacitance of the device changes. This is a common way (with proper calibrations) to get a very precise, electronic reading from a manometer, and this configuration is called a capacitive manometer vacuum gauge.

* Piezoelectric/Piezoresistive - For measurements of small strain, semiconductor strain gauges, called piezoresistors, are often preferred over foil gauges. A semiconductor gauge usually has a larger gauge factor than a foil gauge. Semiconductor gauges tend to be more expensive, more sensitive to temperature changes, and are more fragile than foil gauges.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are going to write a book on Borland Pascal, can you at least mention the fact that it is Borland Pascal ? The first programs I looked at here were not valid Pascal.--[[User:67.180.160.45|67.180.160.45]] 4 July 2005 17:35 (UTC)

Disregarding the date, all of the code looks relatively fine - everything should compile with Free Pascal 2.2.2. [[User:Lostvoid|Lostvoid]] ([[User talk:Lostvoid|talk]]) 03:18, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

==Um...==
I plan on adding a category regarding Units and I plan to elaborate the 'Getting Started' section with the basic format (program, type, const, var, begin, end.) My experience is limited so I do not understand Units very well - I only have 'Essential Pascal' to rely on as a source. 

Also, I personally do not yet understand the following code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;Function WindowProc (Window:HWnd;AMessage : UINT; WParam : WParam; LParam:LParam): LResult; stdcall; export;&lt;/source&gt; I presume the export refers to DLL's (which is another subject I'm unfamiliar with.) [[User:Lostvoid|Lostvoid]] ([[User talk:Lostvoid|talk]]) 07:11, 9 November 2008 (UTC)


==Content==
* Discuss each of the three main compilers more. Provide basic install assistance?
* Beginning: Basic structure, Comments, Code Clarity.
* Variables and Constants: should include data types. Include custom data types?
* External Libraries: DLL's, etc.
* Units: Structure, Usings, Makings.
* Control Structures: Include label..goto?

==Organization==
* Split Syntax from Function/Procedures? Place syntax near the beginning?
* Keep arrays and pointers seperate? Elaborate each.
[[User:Lostvoid|Lostvoid]] ([[User talk:Lostvoid|talk]]) 12:24, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

== Different dialect of Pascal (Object Pascal)==
As pascal programming languages are improved beyond its standard, there are different dialect of pascal programming language , Delphi, Free Pascal and GNU Pascal have differences in their implementation. As an example Delphi supports Interfaces () from version 7 and has for each loop from Delphi 2006 and these are not developed in Free pascal or as another example GNU Pascal has some result definition syntax which is not implemented in other pascals. I think it should be mentioned in this book about different dialects and If a specified implementation is going to be used.</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Basic_foodstuffs|Basic Foodstuffs]] | [[Cookbook:Vegan_Substitutions|Vegan Substitutions]]

==Ingredients==
* 1 1/2 cup shredded dried [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]]
* 4 cups water
* 3 very large cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed but not peeled.
* 1 1/2 tbsp. black [[Cookbook:Peppercorn|peppercorns]]
* 1/2 cup dark Chinese [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* Extra boiling water as needed

==Procedure==
# Place the seaweed in a pot and add 4 cups of water. 
# Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to keep it bubbling along. 
# Cook for 20 minutes.
# Add the rest of the ingredients and enough water to make about 6 cups total in the pot. 
# Bring back to a boil, then boil fairly high for at least 1/2 hour. 
# At that point, begin to taste (just a little, though--it's strong). 
# When the stock is reduced by about half, it will be almost too salty to eat, and that means it is ready. 
# Strain through fine mesh or a coffee filter and allow to cool.

==Ingredients==
*1 large fish (weighing about 2 lbs/1 kg) 
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*2 cups uncooked [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] 
*1 1/2 cups chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] 
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] and water 

== Procedure ==
# Fry fish in olive oil until well cooked. Remove the fish and allow to cool.
# Fry the chopped onions in the same oil until well browned. Meanwhile, bone the fried fish, reserving the cooked fillets to be served over the rice. 
# Add the head, bones and skin of the fish to the fried onions and cook with four cups of water in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes, or for a longer time in an open pan. 
# Strain the broth and boil the rice in it using 1-4 cups of broth for each cup of rice (this will depend on the absorbency of the rice you use). 
# Simmer the rice on a low fire so that most of the broth will be absorbed. 

Some of the broth may be flavored with a few drops of lemon and served on the side as a sauce for this dish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

== What is a database? ==

A '''[[w:database|database]]''' is a collection of [[w:information|information]] stored in a computer in a systematic way, such that a [[w:computer program|computer program]] can consult it to answer questions. The [[w: software|software]] used to manage and query a database is known as a [[w: database management system|database management system]] (DBMS).

For the purposes of English law, s.3A [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_1.htm Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988] defines a database as a collection of independent works, data or other materials which are:
* arranged in a systematic or methodical way, and
* individually accessible by electronic or other means

As such, under English law, a database includes data held electronically and, notably, data held in a non-electronic format, e.g. paper records.

== Legal protection of databases in England &amp; Wales ==

The law in England and Wales recognises the existence of two separate legal rights in databases: (i) '''[[Database_Law#Copyright | copyright]]'''; and (ii) '''[[Database_Law#Database_Right | database right]]'''.

Copyright is available to certain, but not all, databases. The key criterion for determining the availability of copyright to a database is whether the database qualifies as a &quot;literary work&quot;. 

Database right is available to all databases.

== Copyright ==

Copyright in England and Wales is governed by the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_1.htm Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]. For the purposes of this wikibook this will be referred to as the 1988 Act.

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv1 s.1(1)(a)] of the 1988 Act, copyright is stated to &quot;subsist&quot;, i.e. exist, in &quot;original literary works&quot;.

&quot;Literary works&quot; are defined in [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv3 s.3(1)] of the 1988 Act as being &quot;any work, other than a dramatic or musical work, which is written, spoken or sung&quot;. 

Copyright will exist in database if it is sufficiently original; in order to be a literary work, “the selection or arrangement of the contents of the database” must constitute the author's own intellectual creation [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--b.htm#6 s.3A] of the 1988 Act.

===Existence===

Copyright arises automatically in a work that meets the criteria outlined below. There is no need to register copyright in a database with a central organisation.

====Originality====

[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv1 s.1(1)(a)] requires the database to be original.
 
&quot;Original&quot; for the purposes of copyright means that the database is the author's own work, i.e. not copied from the work of another party. 

A common misconception is that an idea can be protected by copyright. This is not correct. Copyright protects that expression and form of an idea, not the idea itself. It is equally the originality of the expression and form that matters, not the idea.

====Minimum effort====

A literary work does not require significant effort in order to obtain copyright protection. Any writing will attract copyright, provided it is substantial enough to constitute a work.

====Recorded====

In order to obtain copyright, data must be recorded. The nature of databases is such that this requirement will always be satisfied.

===Ownership===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv11 s.11(1)] of the 1988 Act, initial ownership is owned by the author or co-authors of a database. 

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv11 s.11(2)] of the 1988 Act, if the author of the database is an employee, copyright in the database is owned by his employer. This is subject to the following provisios:

* the database must have been created in the course of the employee's employment
* there must be no agreement to the contrary between the employer and employee, e.g. an agreement granting the employee copyright in the database 

If a database is commissioned, copyright rests with the author, not the person, company or organisation whom commissioned the database. An agreement whereby a third-party is commissioned to create a database should contain a clause providing for assignment or licence of copyright work. In the case of [http://legal.wikicities.com/wiki/Law_reports/197121qb78 Blair v Alan S Tomkins &amp; Anor (1971) 21 QB 78] it was held that in the absence of licence, one will usually be implied. 

Note, in [http://legal.wikicities.com/wiki/Law_reports/2003ewhc2914 R Griggs Group Ltd v Evans (2003) EWHC 2914]. it was held that the party who commissioned a database may be entitled in equity to beneficial title in the database if a mere licence may not give them enough rights to stop the work being used by a rival.

===Duration===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv12 s.12] of the 1988 Act, copyright will protect a database for the life of the author (or employee) plus 70 years.

===Rights===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_2.htm#mdiv16 s.16] of the 1988 Act, copyright provides the owner of a database with the right to prevent another party copying the database. 

[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv16 s.16] equally provides the owner of a copyright with exclusive rights to:

* copy the work (see [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv17 s.17])
* issue copies of the work to the public (see [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv16 s.18])
* rent or lend the work to the public (see s.18A)
* perform, show or play the work in public (see [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv19 s.19])
* to communicate the work to the public (see [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv20 s.20])

===Infringement===

Copyright in a database is infringed if a “substantial part” of the database is copied by another unauthorised party.

The question of what is a substantial part is qualitative.

====Primary infringement====

A party who commits a primary infringement of copyright in a database is liable regardless of state of mind.

Copying can be indirect – i.e. a result of seeing a copy of the original work – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv16 s.16(3)].

Copyright in a work is infringed by a person who without the licence of the copyright owner does, or authorises another to do, any of the acts restricted by the copyright – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv16 s.16(2)]

There is a rebuttable presumption of copying if the defendant's work is similar to that of the claimant and the defendant has access to the claimant's work.

====Secondary infringement====

Requires knowledge, or reason to believe, that one is dealing with an infringing copy. 

Copies are made without the copyright owner's permission.

Includes:
* people who import infringing goods – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv22 s.22]
* people who sell infringing goods – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_3.htm#mdiv23 s.23]

===Defences===

Fair dealing: 

*for purposes of research or private study – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_4.htm#mdiv29 s.29]
*for purpose of criticism or review – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_4.htm#mdiv29 s.30(1)]
*for the purpose of reporting current events – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_4.htm#mdiv29 s.30(2)]

===Remedies===

Damages for primary infringement – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv97 s.97]
* Note, this remedy is not available if a defendant did not know and had no reason to believe that the database was copyright

Delivery up for primary infringement – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv99 s.99]

The database owner may seize offending copies of the database – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv100 s.100]. 
* Normally this remedy is only used against street traders as the right excludes business premises. 

An infringing party may face criminal liability for making or dealing with infringing articles – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv107 s.107]

Delivery up of infringing copies – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv108 s.108] 

Destruction of offending copies – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv114 s.114]

Order preventing importation of infringing copies – [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_7.htm#mdiv111 s.111]

== Database Right ==

[[w: Database right | Database right]] is a ''[[w: sui generis | sui generis]]'' right that has provided protection for databases in England and Wales since 1997. 

Prior to 1997 the view in England and Wales was that databases were adequately protected by copyright (see previous). This conflicted with the wider view in continental Europe that databases were functional documents, not literary works, and as such could not be protected by copyright.

The European Union passed [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996L0009:EN:HTML Council Directive 96/9/EC on the Legal Protection of Databases] ('the Database Directive') in order to standardise the legal protection provided to databases across the EU.

In England and Wales, the Database Directive was implemented by the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/19973032.htm Copyright and Rights in Databases Regulations 1997 SI 1997/3032] ('the 1997 Regulations'). The 1997 Regulations amended the 1988 Act to limit the extent to which copyright applies to databases (s.3A).  

===Existence===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#13 Reg.13] of the 1997 Regulations, database right subsists in a database if &quot;there has been a substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents of the database&quot;.

In order to qualify for database right in English law, one or more of the creators of the database must reside in the [[w:European Economic Area|European Economic Area]], see [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#18 Reg.18].

Like copyright, database right will arise automatically in databases that meet the criteria provided Regs.13 and 18. The creator of a database right does not need to register the right with a central body.
 
===Ownership===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#15 Reg.15] of the 1997 Regulations, the ''maker'' of the database is the first owner of it.

The ''maker'' is defined in [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#14 Reg.14(1)] of the 1997 Regulations as &quot;the person who takes the initiative in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents of a database and assumes the risk of investing in that obtaining, verification or presentation shall be regarded as the maker of, and as having made, the database&quot;.

Regulation 14(2) provides a caveat that &quot;where a database is made by an employee in the course of his employment, his employer shall be regarded as the maker of the database, subject to any agreement to the contrary&quot;. This is similar to the position with copyright.

===Duration===

[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#17 Regulation 17(1)] of the 1997 Regulations provides that &quot;database right in a database expires at the end of the period of fifteen years from the end of the calendar year in which the making of the database was completed&quot;.

Regulation 17(3) provides further that &quot;any substantial change to the contents of a database, including a substantial change resulting from the accumulation of successive additions, deletions or alterations, which would result in the database being considered to be a substantial new investment shall qualify the database resulting from that investment for its own term of protection&quot;.

In effect, it is possible for databases that are updated regularly to obtain indefinite rolling protection from database right, i.e. every updated version of the database obtains 15 years protection.

===Rights===

Database right gives the owner the right to prevent copying and unauthorised use of the database.

===Infringement===

Under [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#16 Reg.16(1)] of the 1997 Regulations, &quot;a person infringes database right in a database if, without the consent of the owner of the right, he ''extracts'' or ''re-utilises'' all or a ''substantial'' part of the contents of the database&quot;.

Extraction, re-utilisation and substantial are defined in [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#12 Reg.12].

''Extraction'' is defined as &quot;the permanent or temporary transfer of [the] contents [of the database] to another medium by any means or in any form&quot;.

''Re-utilisation'' is defined as &quot;making [the] contents [of the database] available to the public by any means&quot;.

''Substantial'' is defined &quot;in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both&quot;.

Regulation 16(2) further provides that &quot;the repeated and systematic extraction or re-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the contents of a database may amount to the extraction or re-utilisation of a substantial part of those contents&quot;.

===Defences===

Fair dealing - [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--c.htm#20 Reg.20] of the 1997 Regulations:

* extraction by a lawful user - Reg.20(1)(a)
* extraction for purpose of illustration or teaching or for a non-commercial purpose - Reg.20(1)(b)
* the source is indicated - Reg.20(1)(c)

Regulation 20(2) provides further exceptions to database right for public administration. These are detailed in [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/73032--e.htm Schedule 1] of the 1997 Regulations.

== Re: Comfortable Words ==

I haven't even finished the page with the link back to {{Christianity]] the Wikibook I am spearheading and you already put it up for Speedy Deletion, what gives? [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 8 July 2005 20:18 (UTC)
:If it's not a book in its own right, but a subpage of an existing book, it should either be named &lt;code&gt;bookname:subpagename&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;bookname/subpagename&lt;/code&gt; in accordance with [[Wikibooks:Naming_conventions]]. Otherwise, how is a user subsequently going to be able to write a book entitled &quot;Comfortable Words&quot;. Please don't pollute the main namespace, it's bad enough already, but people are slowing converting older books to more recent conventions. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 8 July 2005 20:31 (UTC)

:Update: Also note that using the &lt;code&gt;bookname/subpagename&lt;/code&gt; convention will automatically add a link to the subpage which leads back to the main book. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 8 July 2005 20:34 (UTC)

Sorry, then it's an issue of non-conformity. If I try subpage [[Christianity/The Comfortable Words]] then you delete the other, is that preferable. Or should I or you use redirect?[[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 8 July 2005 20:50 (UTC)

Saw your vote on John 2, thanks. I will redirect all pages to Christianity/... That was the problem and this is the solution, I think. [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 8 July 2005 21:05 (UTC)

:Update: I've moved all the offending pages, and updated the links on the [[Christianity|main page]]. I'll note it in [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 8 July 2005 21:47 (UTC)

Thank you again, when I got back to it, you did all the work. The move function, not redirect, worked for a remaining page [[Palestine map]] and now I understand the naming convention. What a switch, to say, you may have saved Christianity (the book). [[User:Athrash|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] &amp;#45; [[User:Athrash|Athrash]] | [[User_talk:Athrash|&lt;small&gt;{Talk)&lt;/small&gt;]] 9 July 2005 01:30 (UTC)

Update as of September 5 &amp;#8722; Christianity: The Book became The Appendix as calmer influences have the last word. Others may talk til they are green in the face.

==Finalized==
Findings: &amp;#949;&amp;#965;&amp;#961;&amp;#949;&amp;#963;&amp;#953;&amp;#962;&lt;br&gt;
* God so loved the world.
* Start with only a few versions of the Bible, various household references, some ancient manuscripts now available on the Internet and a Wikipedia link. So, begin a new translation with no preconceived notions. The progression is steady just like the early church, in fact parallel. Aramaic and its oral tradition are the backbone. Evidence, the earliest persecutions by Saul of Tarsus were in Damascus, they spoke Aramaic. The Syrian tradition spreads to Egypt, Modernity picks up the earliest Coptic Gospel of John on papyrus which may have come from a trilingual. To ''Koin'' a phrase, early Christianity is to Greek as Shakespeare is to English, making Greek the expansive written language of choice, but something must be said for Latin which would emanate from Caesarea early on. Thus Modernity speaks through Codex D or Bezae of the bilingual Greek-Latin, which some (incl. F.H. Chase) have called Western Syro-Latin text. The introductory Latin Word Picture comes in v. 20 where something was hidden from the light, ironic. The exemplar for the Sub-Achmimic Coptic version would have been 2nd century and for the Codex D, probably 3rd century. Evidence, the Coptic Codex Q (Qua) incorporating the Greek alphabet omits Eccehomo of John 19, but Codex D and Codex B include it, a Latin addition.
::Reference: ''The Gospel of John According to the Earliest Coptic Manuscript'' and Translation by Sir Herbert Thompson, British School of Archaeology in Egypt and Egyptian Research Account. 1923. (Introductory Conclusion, pp. 28-30).
* The conversion of Cephas in Chapter 1 to a tiny wikified image of the screenshot Aramaic rather than ISO numbers which were read differently in different browsers, opened the door to small inline facsimiles of phrasing from ancient manuscripts, a unique placement of Coptic and Latin with the enlargement and more information behind the image link. 
* Something about the laborious method proscribed to recording the Greek Word Pictures and weighing the possibilities for that concise spacing redeems the effort, deepening the thought process. The wordplay seems inevitable.
* Would it be presumptuous to say, if the translator emulates the early church and writes the Word, that such a person becomes possessed and God takes over, setting the rules. Yeshua (Ezra 3: 8) is the simplest Aramism and the name by which the early church would remember Jesus. Every chapter could mention Yeshua in the margin at least once beginning with Chapter 5, only taking liberties in Chapter 15, following the lead of Chapter 1 verse 12 by substituting “name of Jesus” for “name.” This allows the column heading Aramism to stand as a logical extension even when one Latin phrase is cited per chapter, thus bringing to bear the nomina sacra and monumental Latin like pastor for shepherd, paracletus for Comforter, proverbus for figure of speech, yet, confirming the language of Rome plays a minor part overall. Messiah remains the most elevated term, see Chapter 1 and 4 for the only mention of the original word in the N.T. “The Christ” alone is described everywhere else as the Messiah, an Aramism.
* The transition from Latin to Old English is a natural, thus the transition of Iesous from Greek to Latin to O.E. to English reaches an interesting juncture in Chapter 4. Jesus had foreign relations. Modernity opts for universal language at that point. The Coptic version only starts in Chapter 2, first viable sacred name is a preview in 3: 10, unavoidably (the abbreviation &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:overline;&quot;&gt;IHC&lt;/span&gt; represents the unpronounceable name of God already) this shows a mixture of Greek and English translation, an awkward moment, but one of the earliest examples of superlineation and an Aramism of redundant verbage, all in three words, altogether fascinating since the Greek would have required four words adding '''&amp;kappa;&amp;alpha;&amp;iota;''' in between. Latin makes it easier, Codex D starts at John 3: 16, first viable sacred name John 4: 1. The last leaves or pages in both codices are missing bringing the Latin phrases to a dramatic conclusion in Chapter 20 and 21, even more so the Aramaic in Chapter 20.
* Gender issue, double entendre in v. 6 comment. Issue, whether to pursue gender neutral at all? Why tick some people off, because the clock has been ticking long enough and, God willing, the time may have arrived. Issue (meaning, definition number 30 in the Random House, offspring), the birth itself is to issue forth and all human offspring are the bodily issue of a woman. The alternative, flesh, is only skin deep, yet beauty is … This too, a mind, body, and spirit exercise as in v. 9. If the process becomes at all cumbersome then a retraction can be issued. She/he designation (v. 5) is not appropriate for these times, but see nothing wrong with an occasional his/her. The Wikipedia article on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Revised_Standard_Version NRSV] is of interest, commenting:
:''Gender-inclusive language does represent a change from the traditional translations, however, in many cases, the original language, Koine Greek, is gender ambiguous. For example, adelphoi, can be translated as either &quot;brothers&quot; or &quot;brothers and sisters.&quot;''&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bonding==
Dogs are social animals; they live in packs. They will, very soon after you bring them into your home, regard your family as their pack.  This trait is what makes it so easy to train a dog.  

Instinct makes dogs defer to the leader of the pack. This does not mean that they fear the leader, but that they ''respect'' and /or ''love'' him/her.  And it is so much easier for all concerned if that respect and love is reciprocated.

It is cruel to isolate a dog from the pack.  A dog that is tied on a leash (or a chain) in a yard all day long is an abused dog, and he will soon exhibit behavioral problems.  The same is true of a dog that is left in an apartment all day, while its master is at work. If you can't provide comapanionship to a dog, how can you get companionship from him?  If you must leave the dog during the day you should have one or two other animals to keep him comapany.  And they must have adequate space to attend to their needs.

Remember that your dog is a person too, although of a different species.

==Training==
It is perhaps not too extreme to say that every dog needs a job, and that if you don't give him one he will invent one of his own, and you might not like the job he chooses.  So it is essential that your dog must be trained.  He will enjoy doing the jobs you give him, no matter how small or large.  And you will be proud of him.  

You should start with simple things and very gradually progress to more complicated ones.  

Dogs, like people, have varying degrees of ability and varying likes and dislikes.  Some dogs love to swim all day long, others will not even let their feet get wet, though all dogs ''can'' swim if they must.  It is almost as cruel to try to have a dog do something he really doesn't like as it is to lock him in a dark room all day.  And throwing or pushing a dog into the water (for example), in an effort to teach him to swim, will only make him hate water all the more.

===Communication===
Most of the effort in training a dog is spent in communication.  He ''and'' you must learn each other's language to some extent.  Shouting at him will '''''not''''' make him understand you any better.  It will, however, hurt his feelings until he learns that it just your meaningless way of barking, and learns to ignore it.

He will, however, understand your '''''tone''''' of voice almost immediately, so, if you want to tell him &quot;no&quot;, do it in a deep, growl-like way, and if he does the right thing, be happy about it, and tell him so.  But his hearing is very keen, and you can almost whisper.

===Focus===
When you are training your dog, especially if it is something new, you must not allow yourself or him to become distracted.  If something comes up that you '''''must''''' deal with it is better to drop the training entirely, and take it up at a later time.

===How to start===
====First Lessons====
If you have a new puppy, you will want to house-break it as soon as possible.  This can be a very easy process.  The very best way is to teach the puppy to urinate and/or defecate on command.  Don't despair, it is '''''easy'''''.</text>

'''Spinal radiosurgery''' is the one or a few fractions and high doses per fraction for primary or metastatic tumors involving a vertebral body with close proximity to the spinal cord.  It is often used in a site of prior irradiation, so IMRT can be used to limit the dose to the cord.

== Gears ==

Gears are mechanical parts with cut teeth designed to mesh with teeth on another part so as to transmit or receive force and motion. The cut teeth are also sometimes called cogs.
In Robotics Gears are used to transfer rotational forces between axles. They can change speed and direction. The axles can stand in any orientation, however not all orientation can be done with 2 gears. Commonly gears are used to reduce the speed of a motor. When they reduce the speed, the torque of the output axle increases.

Common types of gears as used in Robots are explored below. 
Each type of gear is used for different purposes and it has both advantages and disadvantages.

See [[w:Gear|this Wikipedia article]] on gears. This page will cover how each gear is used specifically in robotics.

=== Spur gear ===
[[image:gears_large.jpg|thumb|Spur gears found on a piece of farm equipment]]
Spur gears are the best known gears. These are the simplest form of gears and are commonly used in light machines as bikes, mixers, etc,...&lt;BR&gt;
They aren't used in cars as they are very noisy and their design puts a lot of stress on the teeth.

You might use them to transfer rotation from a motor output shaft (coming directly from the motor or from the gear box) to the axle on which the wheels are attached. This poses a limitation: the motor output axle and the wheel axle have to be parallel.

=== Bevelled gear ===
Bevelled gears are used when you wish to transfer work between two perpendicular shafts that are on the same plane (if the axles were to be extended they would hit). They can have straight, spiral or hypoid teeth.

=== Worm Gear ===
This is a gear that resembles a screw, with parallel helical teeth, and mates with a normal spur gear. The worm is in most cases the driving gear, there are however a few exceptions where the spur gear drives the worm. The worm gear can achieve a higher gear ratio than spur gears of a comparable size. Designed properly, a built in safety feature can be obtained: This gear style will self-lock if power is lost to the drive (worm) however this feature doesn't work if the pinion is powered.
[[Image:Worm Gear and Pinion.jpg|thumb|An Example of a Worm Gear and Pinion]]

===Rack and Pinion===

Torque can be converted to linear force by a rack and pinion. The pinion is a spur gear, and meshes with a toothed bar or rod that can be thought of as a sector gear with an infinitely large radius of curvature. Such a mechanism is used in automobiles to convert the rotation of the steering wheel into the left-to-right motion of the tie rod(s).

==Internal gear==

==Chains &amp; Belts==

Chains and belts can be used to transfer rotational motion over a longer distance. The main difference between the two, lays in the fact that a belt can slip. This is not necessarily a bad thing as slipping occurs when the output shaft carries a load that is too heavy. In this case the belt slips instead of the motor being stalled. This protects the motor as it could otherwise be damaged by the stall current.&lt;BR&gt;
The disadvantage of belts is that since it can slip, the amount of rotation  doesn't remain the same, e.g., the input axle may turn 4 times, while the output axle may turn only 3.8 times. This should be taken into account if the position of the output axle is important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Video components split up in 2 categories. On one hand you have a video camera, some form of transmission (wire or radio) and a display. On the other hand you have computer vision.

==Camera, transmission, display==
There are very small cameras, some even with built in wireless connection, which are cheap and need hardly any external components. These cameras can be mounted on a robot and let the user see through the robots &quot;eyes&quot;.

If the robot has an on-board computer (single board or laptop) a webcam can be used. This allows robot control over a network or even the internet.

==Computer Vision==
Computer vision is a relatively new area. It tries to provide a computer with eyes and the ability to &quot;understand&quot; what it sees. The first step is easy. Webcams have been around for quite some time. However the second step, understanding the image, is the hard one.

{{AltBookCat}}

Image processing plays a substantial part in robotics where computer vision is used.  There are many aspects to image processing including: demosaicing, image registration, differencing, recognition and segmentation.

==Demosaicing==
Demosaicing is perhaps the first step in image processing as it pertains to computer vision due to the fact that this process occurs just after the image is initially captured.  In general, demosaicing is an algorithm that takes the image after being processed by a color filter array (CFA), such as a Bayer filter, and reconstructs a full color image.  The image shown on the left is the output from the CFA and the image on the right shows the reconstructed image using the demosaicing algorithm.  The result is an overall loss in detail and sharpness leading to a loss in resolution.

==Image Registration==
Image registration is the process used to combine multiple images into a single coordinate system.  Combining images into a single coordinate system makes it easier to process the data contained in images taken at different times or from different perspectives.  There are two main types of image registration based on how the images are combined into a single coordinate system.  The first of which is intensity based, which uses correlation metrics to compare intensity patterns within the images to combine them.  The other method is feature based, which uses points, lines and contours within the images to combine the images.  Image registration has also been used in the realm of digital photography with the process of photo-stitching.

==Image Differencing==
Image differencing is used to obtain the changes between two images and is done by comparing the images pixel by pixel.
A typical application of image differencing is with a traffic camera that needs to determine where cars are located
in an image.  By taking an image and finding the difference between it and the frame before it, the result is an image
similar to the one shown where the outlines of the vehicles are neatly shown.  The problem with this method
is that there is a gap between the images in where the car is located.  To solve this problem,
taking the difference between the current image and a stock image that was taken when no cars were present gives a much clearer image depicted where the cars are located.

==Image Recognition==
The process of image recognition is difficult to pull off in the realm of computer vision.  Nothing comes close to what a human can accomplish, but robots can do simpler tasks.  Some of the simpler tasks that can be accomplished within computer vision are recognizing simple geometric shapes, human faces and fingerprints.
Different aspects of the problems involved with image recognition include: object recognition, identification
and detection.  An implementation of image recognition is known as geometric hashing.  The 
geometric hashing algorithm uses a model image of a particular object such as a computer mouse to see if it is located in a given image.

==Image Segmentation==
The process of image segmentation is used to simplify other aspects of image processing.  This includes breaking an image down into smaller pieces making object detection and edge detection easier.  The K-means algorithm
can be used to segment the image into K clusters.  The basic algorithm is shown below.

// Basic K-means algorithm

1.	Pick K cluster centers, either randomly or based on some heuristic

2.	Assign each pixel in the image to the cluster that minimizes the variance between the pixel and the cluster center

3.	Re-compute the cluster centers by averaging all of the pixels in the cluster

4.	Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence is attained (e.g. no pixels change clusters)</text>

The following is from: Brown, Rupert; Gaertner, Samuel L. Editors. - Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Intergroup Processes - 2002

p. 65 &quot;In particular, two traditionally held views have undergone major revision. One view, that children become gradually more prejudiced with age, is no longer tenable. Empirical research now typically shows an inverted-U relation between age and prejudice. The second view, that children learn stereotypes and prejudice solely from parents and peers, has also not been supported. Rather, children are now seen to play a more active role in the biases they develop. Perhaps the revisions are due in part to a decline in normative forms of prejudice and thus greater variability in attitudes of parents and children.&quot;

p. 66 &quot;Ethnic bias has been particularly harmful in imposing constraints on the social and academic opportunities afforded minority children, and on the social relationships of majority children. Gender stereotypes impose the same harmful constraints on development; however, we know that boys and girls will eventually be dating and mating. The ethnic divide only becomes larger with age, not necessarily because of personal bias, but because of societal structures such as marriage and religion that keep us a Dart.&quot;

p. 67 &quot;A discussion of measurement techniques leads to the question of how children's prejudice differs from adults' prejudice. This question often arises because teachers and parents express disbelief at the early high levels of prejudice reported by researchers. They claim to be unaware of prejudice in all but a few young children. Most people identify spontaneous slurs and stereotypic remarks as indications of prejudice. Children, however, differ from adults in verbal and emotional sophistication. Consequently, they do not frequently express their prejudice in racial slurs. Furthermore, the emotional underpinnings of children's prejudice is less likely to be anger and hostility and more likely to be suspicion, fear, sadness, and expectations or projections of rejection, harm, and avoidance.&quot;

p. 70 &quot;By the time minority children are between 7 and 10 years old, any pro-White bias seems to have disappeared, and they either no longer exhibit any clear bias or express pro-ingroup bias.&quot;

p. 71 &quot;This is demonstrated with measures that highlight a fixation on ethnic classification over multiple classification. For example, children have been asked to sort pictures of people into as many groups as they like, based on whatever criteria are salient to them (&quot;Make groups of children who go together or who are similar&quot;). In some studies, race was a particularly salient cue for sorting, more salient than gender or age (e.g., Davey, 1983; Ramsey, 1991), whereas in others race was less salient (Bennett, Dewberry, &amp; Yeeles, 1991; Bigler &amp; Liben, 1993; Hirschfeld, 1996; Verkuyten, Masson, &amp; Elffers, 1995). When children were asked to reclassify pictures they had already sorted based on one dimension, for example, race, they found this difficult at 4 and 5 years, but generally were able to resort at 6 or 7 years (Bigler &amp; Liben, 1993). More difficult was the simultaneous multiple classification task which requires that the child use two criteria such as race and gender to classify people.&quot;

p. 72 &quot;Most studies do not report the number of children who have close cross-race friends, but when they do, the percentages appear to be less than 50% during pre- and early adolescence (Aboud &amp; Mendelson, 1999; DuBois &amp; Hirsch, 1990; Graham &amp; Cohen, 1997). Although studies generally report gender effects, there has been no consistent finding that girls or boys have more cross-race friends.
&quot;Black, Hispanic, and Asian students have generally, but not always, reported more cross-race friends than White students.&quot;

p. 73 &quot;Several theories have been formulated over the years to explain the development of prejudice. The most commonly held theory of prejudice is that it is learned from parents (Allport, 1954). Most lay people, educators, and psychologists explain the ethnic conflicts and name-calling of young children in this manner. &quot;If children are not born prejudiced, then they must have learned it from their parents&quot; is the logic employed. The alternative cognitive-developmental theory proposes that cognitive maturation leads children at a young age to construct and evaluate categories from available information, and that subsequent maturation leads children to differentiation within these categories (Aboud, 1988; Katz, 1976; Piaget &amp; Weil, 1951). Individual differences in the way children use these categories (Levy &amp; Dweck, in press) may explain why some children maintain prejudice into adolescence. We now describe the theories and the evidence pertaining to them.&quot;
Any guess which side he'll favor?

p. 74 &quot;The simplest way to demonstrate parental influence on the acquisition of prejudice is to correlate the attitudes of parents and children. Some studies have found a small correlation (Carlson &amp; lovini, 1985; Mosher &amp; Scodel, 1960). Others found no significant relationship between White parents and their children (Aboud &amp; Doyle, 1996b; Davey, 1983) or Black parents and their children (Branch &amp; Newcombe, 1986). Children of 10 years could not accurately predict the attitudes of their parents or best friends, but their own attitudes correlated significantly with what they thought were others' attitudes (Aboud &amp; Doyle, 1996b; Epstein &amp; Komorita, 1966). Children generally seem to perceive in others levels of prejudice comparable to their own, either because they egocentrically distort others' attitudes or because they have little real evidence on which to base judgments to the contrary.
&quot;Most children receive very little information about race or ethnicity from their parents. Kofkin, Katz, and Downey (1995) reported that only 26% of White parents of 3-yearold children had ever commented on race, usually for the purpose of teaching their children about equality and appreciating differences, or merely to answer their children's questions. The correlation between parent and child attitudes was .33 in families where race had been discussed, and nonsignificant in families where race had not been discussed. This suggests that children are influenced by their parents' attitudes only when parents explicitly talk about their views. Typically it is in regions where ethnic conflict is high that parents explicitly and emotionally express their attitudes (e.g., Bar-Tal, 1996; Duckitt, 1988), leading to the one-sided conclusion that high prejudice in children comes from parents. However, parents are just as likely to be responsible for lowering the levels of prejudice in their children.&quot;
Informative.

p. 75 &quot;In contrast with gender socialization, which appears to decline with age during childhood, minority ethnic socialization may increase as parents detect their children's receptivity to the more complex aspects of ethnic group membership. Likewise, it is thought that minority children derive important ideas about minority group identity from watching television programs, which to date have not provided the kinds of models that parents find desirable (Graves, 1993).&quot;
I was right in my criticism of Elijah Anderson's work - media is a major influence on youth, minorities in particular.

p. 79 &quot;Intervention experimental studies. Because category formation and outgroup homogeneity appear at a young age, researchers have not attempted to train these skills in order to observe their role in the formation of prejudice. However, a number of cognitive approaches have been used in schools to reduce prejudice. The common one is to provide knowledge about the cultural ways of minority groups. This is unrelated to cognitive developmental theory in that it makes no reference to age-related cognitive structures, but rather to the idea that prejudice is based on ignorance. Typically these studies find no consistent effect of information on reducing prejudice (Pate, 1988; Furuto &amp; Furuto, 1983). In fact, the presentation of information about typical cultural patterns, simplified for young schoolchildren, runs the risk of contributing to group stereotypes. Even if the goal is to instill a positive stereotype, say about the eating habits of Chinese people, it is quite inappropriate to teach children that Chinese Americans use chopsticks, when many of them do not.
&quot;More successful are role-playing programs, where students re-examine their attitudes after experiencing powerlessness or discrimination in a simulation game (McGregor, 1993). Another cognitive approach, called antiracist teaching, seeks to reduce prejudice by discussing the social/historical inequalities that underlie racism and discrimination. Role-playing and antiracist teaching, however, are limited in scope and application. First, they are rarely used with elementary schoolchildren because they require a certain amount of social and emotional sophistication. Secondly, they may unintentionally portray minority members as helpless victims, rather than as potentially respectable friends. Thirdly, they are directed to a White audience only, and the material is often inappropriate for non-White ethnic group members. Fourthly, they may raise feelings of guilt that young children cope with in unproductive ways, for example, by blaming the victim or denying wrongdoing.&quot;

p. 80 &quot;In summary, there may be several routes to the acquisition and reduction of prejudice. Children appear to have a predisposition to create ethnic categories around age 4 or 5, and then to use these to infer group distinctions and homogeneity of members within categories. If evaluations from parents are explicit, preoperational children may adopt these evaluations. However, a more likely scenario is that prejudice is acquired when children identify with one ethnic category and generalize their self-esteem to their group, or without a salient identification they generalize from social attachments to similar others. As a function of age and familiarity, children become more flexible in their thinking and more reciprocal in their social relations; this results in fewer distinctions between ethnic groups, more differentiation within groups, better reconciliation of differences, and use of multiple cross-cutting categories. These social-cognitive abilities, developing in the concrete operational stage, appear to contribute to a post-7 year reduction in prejudice. Minority group children differ from White children only in their greater attitude variability pre-7 years. They may not all follow the ingroup preference route to the extent that ingroup identification is not salient or personal attachments are multiethnic. Why some but not all children develop balanced attitudes in middle childhood is not clear, though there may be individual differences in cognitive assumptions about people or the presence of other controlled, as opposed to automatic, processes such as belief in fairness. Research published over the next decade will address questions about social and cognitive inputs to prejudice by designing experimental interventions to prevent early high levels of prejudice and to reduce prejudice and discrimination in school children (see Aboud &amp; Levy, 2000).&quot;

These look like very reasonable and comprehensive notes and should be added.

== Some examples of specific types of alleged racism ==

*[[w:Afrocentrism|Afrocentrism]] - the belief that black African cultures were historically more powerful and influential than most historians believe, or that certain ancient civilizations were created or maintained by black Africans
*[[w:Anti-Semitism|Anti-Semitism]] - racism directed towards followers of the Jewish faith or people of Jewish [[ethnicity]], the latter often including those who follow other faiths.
*[[w:Apartheid|Apartheid]] - a now defunct, white supremacist system that once existed in [[South Africa]], in which Whites, Blacks and &quot;Coloreds&quot; were segregated; some refer to current Israeli policies towards Palestinians as apartheid as well.
*[[w:Black supremacy|Black supremacy]] - the belief that those of African descent are the superior race.
*[[w:Bumiputra|Bumiputra]] -  A system whereby Malays are accorded economic privileges not available to those of other races.
*[[w:Caste|Caste system]] - (not always considered racist) A system of social hierarchy among various social groups, such as in India often stratified along color lines, with the darkest individuals being members of the most subordinate caste - each assigned a specific occupation and social role.
*[[w:Colonialism|Colonialism]] - a practice of the imperial powers of Europe and Asia, wherein foreign territories were subjugated and minority ruling classes were installed to exploit the natural and human resources of the territory.  Although not explicitly racist by intent, negative consequences due to racism nearly always resulted.
*[[w:Colorism|Colorism]] - a bias against dark skin resulting from an internalization of white racist values, manifested in such things as the [[w:brown paper bag test|paper bag test]]. There seems to be an implicit calculus behind this belief that makes the worth of an individual inversely related to the darkness of his/her skin.
*[[w:Cultural genocide|Cultural genocide]] is a term used to describe the deliberate destruction of the cultural heritage of a people for political or military reasons.
*[[w:Ethnic Cleansing|Ethnic Cleansing]] - the intentional and systematic relocation and/or elimination of different ethnicities to produce an ethnicly &quot;pure&quot; territory or country - for example, recent history in the former Yugoslavia
*[[w:Eurocentrism|Eurocentrism]] - the practice of historically and culturally focusing on white Europeans, to the exclusion of study, or even mention of, significant achievements of other groups of people; and often the appropriation of achievements of people of color as being European in origin
*[[w:Genocide|Genocide]] - the intentional and systematic elimination of different races to produce an racially &quot;pure&quot; territory or country - for example, the history of the Third Reich
*[[w:Institutionalized Racism|Institutionalized Racism]] - the process of purposely discriminating against certain groups of people through the use of biased laws or practices.  Often, institutionalized racism is subtle and manifests itself in seemingly innocuous ways, but its effects are anything but subtle.  An example of this type of racism is the [[w:redlining|redlining]] of districts to keep certain people from moving in to a new neighborhood, pervasive in the financial industry in the 1950s and 60s.
*[[w:Islamist terrorism|Islamic terrorism]] - Political [[w:reverse discrimination|reverse discriminatory]] prejudice and terrorism against non-Muslims, Muslims who do not adhere to their particular brand of Islam, and non-Islamic governments.
*[[w:Islamophobia|Islamophobia]] - the manifestation of hatred and hostility towards [[w:Muslim|Muslims]] and sometimes [[w:Arab|Arab]] people in general.
*[[w:Manifest Destiny|Manifest Destiny]] - a historical form of the belief that asserted that white Americans had the right and duty to colonize the West and &quot;[[w:civilize|civilize]]&quot; the [[w:Native American|Native American]] inhabitants.
*[[w:Model Minority|Model Minority]] - stereotype that [[w:Asian Americans|Asian Americans]] are intelligent and hardworking and should serve as a &quot;model&quot; for other minorities in the United States
*[[w:Nazism|Nazism]] (National Socialism) - a historical form of political organization coupled with extreme racism, that directed its energies against the [[w:Jew]]s, [[w:Roma (people)|Roma]] (the so-called Gypsies), [[w:Poles|Poles]], among other groups. Some adherents of Nazi ideology continue to exist today.
*[[w:Racial purity|Racial purity]] - the belief that the various so-called races should be kept &quot;pure&quot; by not permitting interbreeding
*[[w:Racial segregation|Racial segregation]] - the discriminatory practice of separating groups in society along racial lines, often associated with privilege, power and entitlement for a dominant group and disdvantage and oppression for the subordinate one.
*[[w:Redlining|Redlining]] - the practice of denying marginalized communities services (such as food delivery or taxi service), or access to home or business loans allowing residents to build equity and have a financial stake in their own communities, or refusal to locate businesses or other services in marginalized communities (such as supermarkets, banks, or bus and subway routes).
*[[w:Reverse discrimination|Reverse discrimination]] or [[w:reverse racism|reverse racism]] - the belief that measures designed to correct alleged racism, such as [[Affirmative action]], have in fact simply created new racist policies against the dominant groups. This is a highly controversial idea.
*[[w:White flight|White flight]] - the practice of white residents abandoning a neighborhood or area due to the arrival of black or other residents, often weakening the tax base and reducing public services. The practice is also known as the [[w:tipping point|tipping point]].
*[[w:White man's burden|White man's burden]] - the belief once held by Europeans that they were obligated to civilize and &quot;correct&quot; the great unwashed heathen masses of the world.  Although considered a noble mission by some, in practice its consequences nearly always resulted in more human suffering.  Term coined by [[Rudyard Kipling]].  Similar to &quot;colonialism&quot;.
*[[w:White skin privilege|White privilege]] - preferential treatment enjoyed by [[w:whites|white persons]] in various aspects of society.
*[[w:White supremacy|White supremacy]] - the belief that Caucasians are, as a race, superior or worthy of supremacy, even called by some the &quot;[[w:master race|master race]]&quot;. 
*Attitudes of [[w:suburb|suburb]] and [[w:gated community|gated community]] developers, who are often accused of pandering to racist views by emphasizing &quot;crime risk&quot; in more racially diverse downtowns, especially in [[North America]].

== My Recommendations Regarding Accuracy, Errors and Additional Detail.  ==


Hetep and Respect SuperUnspecial Wiki is a wonderful tool but as all new open tools it is a double-edged sword.  That is, one will find accurate information and errors. This is especially true with respect to cultural information. 

Below you will find my notes regarding this article, which, have been formally submitted to my fellow wikipedians and wikibookians for their consideration as we speak.
 

This book deals with complex subject matter and is useful as an introductory survey of the range of issues associated with notions of ethnicity and the later concepts of Euro-centrism and ‘race” my comments should be of interests to those concerned with sociology, anthropology, psychology, the nature of Cultural Health and social science in general.  

The book like many in their early start up phase contains accuracy, error and the need for more detail. Below you will find my contribution, insofar as with my wikipedian hat on, I can attest to accuracy, point out an error and make a recommendation for the addition of detail. 
'''
Accurate:'''

“…Debates continue in and among academic disciplines as to how race should be understood. Most sociologists believe race is a social construct, meaning it does not have a basis in the natural world but is simply an artificial distinction created by humans. As a result of this understanding, some researchers have turned from conceptualizing and analyzing human variation by race to doing so in terms of populations, dismissing racial classifications altogether. In the face of the increasing rejection of race as a valid classification scheme, many social scientists have replaced the word race with the word ethnicity to refer to self-identifying groups based on shared religion, nationality, or culture…”

“…The understanding of race as a social construct is well-illustrated by examining race issues in two countries, the U.S. and Brazil…”

This is a very useful survey and the contrast between the U.S. with its approximate 13 million African Americans and Brazil with more then 100 million African Brazilians is a good introduction to the subject.  

'''Errors:'''

Here the first ethnographic studies are correctly attributed to “Egypt” But the indigenous name of the Country Kemet is not mentioned and the fact that we are here talking about Classical African Civilization in the same way that Greece is related to Western Civilization needs to be corrected. One must be careful here not to insert or overlook the work of anti-Kemetic Egyptologists. Anti-Kemetic Cultural Poisoning should be avoided and historicity should be maintained. 

“…The division of humanity into distinct races can be traced as far back as the Ancient Egyptian sacred text the Book of Gates, which identified four races according to the Egyptians. This early treatment merged racial and ethnic differences, combining skin-color with tribal and national identities.

Here we have and example of mixing up truth with falsehood. The classical Africans of Kemet (Egypt) did produce the first ethnographic studies but they had no word for “race”. Yet the author talks as if such a concept existed, it did not, and he offers no proof that it did exist. I personally have never seen or heard of any word in the 10,000 year history of metu neter, (hieroglyphics) for “race”. 

The Kemetic people do not ‘identify four “races” ‘ in this ethnographic study from the time of Seti I in the book of Gates. They do identify three major ethnic groups and two Nationalities. Blacks are shown by nationality Kemetian (Egyptian) and Nubian. The other two ethnic groups are Caucasian (White) and Multi-ethnic (Semitic).

There is also an Ethnographic study from the time of Ramosis II that deliniates three major ethnic groups and  Two Nationalities. The study precisely notes the Kemetic nationality as belonging to the Black ethnic group. So the first ethnographic studies in recorded history, c. 1500 - 1200 B.C.E., delineate the three major ethnic groups Blacks, Asians and lastly Whites/Semites. Despite the invention of the word “race” some approximately 2,700 years later.  I have seen no evidence to invalidate the Cultural Health Golden Rule (There is one race the human race and many ethnic groups) established by the first sociologists in recorded history.

'''Recommendation for Additional Detail'''

&quot;...The word race was introduced to English from the French in the late 16th century...&quot;

I do not have the details on the tip of my tongue but this detail should be filled in, as the facts are known. I recommend the following level of detail be added. 

Name of first users of “race”, his book and page number (non racial use)

Name of Second user, book and page number (First racial use)

The 18th century rise of academic Euro-centrism and Racism, at the German university of Gottingen (Bernal 1987).

'''Worcestershire Sauce''', pronounced &quot;Wuh'ster'sher,&quot; can trace its origins back to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]]. The original recipe was brought back by a Lord Sandys from Bengal, and is kept a closely guarded secret. The ingredients include malt [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] (from barley), spirit [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]], [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]], [[Cookbook:Tamarind|tamarind]] extract, [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spice]] and flavourings. The production process includes maturation in oak barrels for several months.

First made by Lea &amp; Perrins in 1835, the company still makes the sauce in the same way today. It is invaluable for spicing up savoury dishes.</text>

Level spelled backward is level,as both ends of a foundation should be! Bubble levels come in many shapes and sizes, the smallest one used to level the longest length. It is a line level and the idea is to stretch a string as taut as one dares to and hang this little 3 inch level on it. These are hard to work with and wind can cause false readings. The best level for long foundations is the water level. Other builders levels are the torpedo, a 9&quot; level, that are great for scaffold building if they are magnatized. There are 18&quot;, 2ft,4ft, and 6ft levels. It is always a good idea to check one level against another by simply stacking one on top of the other to make sure that they read the same.

Iraqi cuisine has changed and evolved since the time of the Babylonians, Sumerians and Assyrians. The cuisine has been influenced by those ancient civilizations, which also had influence Greek and Persian cuisines. With the coming of Islam and the spread of Arab culture, which influenced the region, the food was enhanced to combine old and new sets of tastes.

As Baghdad became the centre of the Islamic world, Muslims from all over (Africa, India, China, Indonesia, etc.) visited Iraq, which gave Iraq new twists to its food. As Iraqis traveled, trading absorbed Mediterranean flavors.

With the Ottoman rule of Iraq, influences of Turkish cuisine also became incorporated into Iraqi recipes.

==First Order Differential Equations==

The simplest types of differential equations to solve are the '''first order equations'''.  These are equations where the highest derivative in the equation is the first. So, a first order equation is a function &lt;math&gt;F(x,y,y^{\prime})&lt;/math&gt;; there are no occurrences of &lt;math&gt;y^{\prime \prime}&lt;/math&gt; or higher derivatives.  

There are two easily solved types of first order equations.  These are equations with '''separable variables''' and '''linear equations'''.  This chapter covers how to solve and graph any equation in one of these forms, or reducible to these forms.  Other types of differential equations, such as '''non-linear equations''', are not covered yet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== book rating ==

There is a template to rate the books: {{stage|75%|Apr 3, 2005}} and {{stage short|75%|Apr 3, 2005}}. Important - in the dynamic wiki environment - is the date when the rating was issued.

In the beginning the rating of pages was just done by a small icon (you know 0%.png, 25%.png) etc. pp. and most pages are still rated this way.

However it is suggested that any new rating is done with the templates above. This templates also show the date when the rating was done.

See [[Help:Development_stages]] for more details on how to rate a book.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Branches of Philosophy ==
In order to narrow the aims of discussion philosophy was broken into branches. Traditionally philosophy has been broken into four main branches; however we would like to add a fifth branch in our text  

=== Epistemology ===
{{cleanup}} 
'''Epistemology, or the Introduction to the Five Branches of Philosophy

Philosophy can be divided into five branches which address the following questions:

Metaphysics	Study of Existence	What's out there?
Epistemology	Study of Knowledge	How do I know about it?
Ethics	Study of Action	What should I do?
Politics	Study of Force	What actions are permissible?
Esthetics	Study of Art	What can life be like?

There is a hierarchical relationship between these branches as can be seen in the Concept Chart. At the root is Metaphysics, the study of existence and the nature of existence. Closely related is Epistemology, the study of knowledge and how we know about reality and existence. Dependent on Epistemology is Ethics, the study of how man should act. Ethics is dependent on Epistemology because it is impossible to make choices without knowledge. A subset of Ethics is Politics: the study of how men should interact in a proper society and what constitutes proper. Esthetics, the study of art and sense of life is slightly separate, but depends on Metaphysics, Epistemology, and Ethics.

e theory of knowledge, from the Greek words episteme (knowledge) and logos (word/speech) is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, origin, scope and possibility of knowledge.'''

=== Metaphysics ===
'''Metaphysics however (derived from the Greek words &quot;ta meta ta physika biblia&quot;) - meaning 'the book that follows the physics book'. It was the way students referred to a specific book in the works of Aristotle, and it was a book on First Philosophy. (The assumption that the word means &quot;beyond physics&quot; is misleading) Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy concerned with the study of &quot;first principles&quot; and &quot;being&quot; (ontology).''' In other words, Metaphysics is the study of the most general aspects of reality, pertaining to subjects such as substance, identity, the nature of the mind, and free will.In other way is a study of nature and the nature of the world in which man lives

=== Logic ===
'''Logic (from Classical Greek λόγος (logos), originally meaning the word, or what is spoken, but coming to mean thought or reason) is most often said to be the study of arguments. Logic is the study of correct reasoning. However, the subject is grounded, the task of the logician is the same: to advance an account of valid and fallacious inference to allow one to distinguish

=== Ethics ===
'''Ethics is a general term for what is often described as the &quot;science (study) of morality&quot;. In philosophy, ethical behaviour is that which is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;right.&quot; The Western tradition of ethics is sometimes called moral philosophy.

===''' Other Branches''' ===


'''Philosophy of Education:' Fairly self-explanatory. A minor branch, mainly concerned with what is the correct way to educate a person. Classic works include Plato's Republic, Locke's Thoughts Concerning Education, and Rousseau's Emile.

'''Philosophy of History:''' Fairly minor branch (not as minor as education), although highly important to Hegel and those who followed him, most notably Marx. It is the philosophical study of history, particularly concerned with the question whether history (i.e. the universe and/or humankind) is progressing towards a specific end? Hegel argued that it was, as did Marx. Classic works include Vico's New Science, and Hegel and Marx's works.

'''Philosophy of Language:''' Ancient branch of philosophy which gained prominence in the last century under Wittgenstein. Basically concerned with how our languages affect our thought. Wittgenstein famously asserted that the limits of our languages mark the limits of our thought. Classic works include Plato's Cratylus, Locke's Essay, and Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.

'''Philosophy of Law:''' Also called Jurisprudence. Study of law attempting to discern what the best laws might be, how laws came into being in the first place, attempting to delimit human laws from natural laws, whether we should always obey the law, and so on. Law isn't often directly dealt with by philosophers, but much of political philosophy obviously has a bearing on it.

'''Philosophy of Mathematics:''' Concerned with issues such as, the nature of the axioms and symbols (numbers, triangle, operands) of mathematics that we use to understand the world, do perfect mathematical forms exist in the real world, and so on. Principia Mathematica is almost certainly the most important work in this field.

'''Philosophy of Mind:''' Study of the mind, attempting to ascertain exactly what the mind is, how it interacts with our body, do other minds exist, how does it work, and so on. Probably the most popular branch of philosophy right now, it has expanded to include issues of AI. Classic works include Plato's Republic and Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, although every major philosopher has had some opinion at least on what the mind is and how it works.

'''Philosophy of Politics:''' Closely related to ethics, this is a study of government and nations, particularly how they came about, what makes good governments, what obligations citizens have towards their government, and so on. Classic works include Plato's Republic, Hobbes' Leviathan, Locke's Two Treatises, and J.S. Mill's On Liberty.

'''Philosophy of Religion:''' Theology is concerned with the study of God, recommending the best religious practises, how our religion should shape our life, and so on. Philosophy of religion is concerned with much the same issues, but where Theology uses religious works, like the Bible, as it's authority, philosophy likes to use reason as the ultimate authority.

'''Philosophy of Science:''' It is the Study of science concerned with whether scientific knowledge can be said to be certain, how we obtain it, can science really explain everything, does causation really exist, can every event in the universe be described in terms of physics and so on. Also popular in recent times, classic works include Hume's Treatise on Human Nature, Kripke's Naming and Necessity, Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Doing Philosophy ==
Many fields can be studied and learned without ever actually working with the tools in the field.  For instance, chemistry can be learned in depth without ever picking up a test tube or mixing ionic compounds.  Philosophy, however, is more about the methodology behind deriving answers than it is about the answers themselves.  As such, students studying philosophy must use the methodology of philosophy on the philosophy they are learning as they are learning it.  Doing philosophy involves asking the right questions, critically examining the work of previous philosophers, truly understanding the works and the reasoning behind the works, and possibly building on the works of previous philosophers by expanding or testing this methodology.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistani Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian Cuisine]]

'''Naan''' is a round [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] made with white [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and is a staple accompaniment to hot meals in central and southern Asia.

==Ingredients==
To make approximately 4 large naan breads:
* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (450g) plain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1 cup (240ml) [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3/4 cup (180ml) water



==Procedure==
# [[Cookbook:Knead|Knead]] the dough by combining all the ingredients and sufficient water (this will be approximately 3/4 cup but some judgement is required).
# Wrap the dough in a damp muslin cloth and leave it to rise for 2-3 hours.
# Divide the dough into small balls.
# Roll out the balls in oblong or round shape with a rolling pin or by slapping and stretching with your hands.
# Smear the surface with water and bake in a tandoor or preheated oven (as hot as your oven will go).
# The naans should puff up a little, and be ready to remove from the oven in 4 to 5 minutes.
# Brush the naan with butter. Serve hot.

==Alternative Recipe Ingredients==
* 1 tsp dried active yeast
* 1 tsp sugar
* 200g/7oz white bread flour
* pinch black onion seeds (nigella seeds)
* ¼ tsp salt
* ½ tsp baking powder
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 2 tbsp natural yoghurt
* 2 tbsp milk

==Alternative Recipe Procedure==
# Preheat the oven to 140C/275F/Gas 1.
# In a small bowl, mix the yeast with one tablespoon of warm water. Stir in the sugar and leave it in a warm place for five minutes until the yeast is covered with froth. This will show that the yeast is ready to use.
# Mix together the flour, onion seeds, salt and baking powder. Stir in the oil, yoghurt and milk, then stir in the activated yeast mixture.
# To knead the dough, clench your hand into a fist, wet your knuckles with a little water, then press them repeatedly into the dough. Continue pressing and kneading until you have a soft, pliable dough. It should take about 10 minutes. Leave to rest for 10 minutes and then knead again for another 5 minutes.
# Place the dough in a mixing bowl, cover it with cling film and leave it in a warm place to rise for 20-30 minutes.
# Divide the dough into four balls and place on a floured surface or board. Roll each into a long oval shape about 0.5cm (¼ inch) thick. 
# Place them on a greased baking tray and put them in the centre of the oven for 10-15 minutes. They are ready when they have puffed up a little. Serve fresh from the oven.

==Notes, tips and variations==
{{wikipedia}}
* To add an extra crispy finish, pop the baked naans under a preheated grill for 30 seconds before brushing with butter and serving.
* To add extra flavour, consider adding finely chopped garlic and coriander to the butter you brush over your cooked naan breads. Then return them to the oven (or place under a grill) for a short time to cook the garlic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When editing this chapter, please make sure to keep in mind that what we consider ''doing philosophy'' is that of reading of ideas. That is we do not whish to have our reader be confused by saying &quot;Wait, you mean I have to read to be a philosopher!? I suppose I am just a deep thinker then.&quot; This is far from the case. We wish our philosophical friends to feel comfortable, but please make sure to inform them that the idea of doing philosophy does lay in the fact of not posing ideas that have already been said. 

That is, please do not forget that there are other people in the world who might have thought the same as you, and they might have thought before you. It is common then to read works to become familiar with ideas in order to perhaps build upon them or relate to them. This way, your idea seems less abstract when trying to relate it to another person.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Cuisine of Italy]] | [[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta Recipes]]

There are as many ways of preparing '''Pasta e Fagioli''' (or ''Basta Fazool'' if you come from southern Italy) as there are Italians. In 1940's Brooklyn, all the Italians would have it every Friday night because it is meatless. Usually it is a soup dominated by tomatoes. This recipe, in contrast, is the consistency of a stew, and is dominated by the umami flavor.

{{see also|Cookbook:Pasta and bean soup}}

==Ingredients==
*1 pound dried white [[Cookbook:Legumes|beans]]
*1 cup of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*a whole clove of [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic]], unshelled
*1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]
*1 teaspoon or more crushed or ground [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|hot red pepper]]
*fresh [[Cookbook:parsley|parsley]]
*½ pound of small diameter [[Cookbook:Pasta|macaroni]], whole [[Cookbook:wheat|wheat]] is best
*[[Cookbook:salt|salt]] to taste.

==Procedure==
#Put washed beans in salted water, 3 parts to 1 part beans.
#Soak overnight  OR bring to boil, boil 2 minutes and let stand, covered, for 1 hour.
#Do not drain beans, but bring to a boil.
#Skim off foam and add oil, garlic and bay leaf.
#Simmer for about 2 hours, or until tender.
#Cook pasta for 6 or 7 minutes, but don't let it get too soft.
#Drain pasta and save some of the water.
#Stir pasta and red pepper into beans and simmer until pasta is eatably soft, adding some of the saved water if necessary.
#Garnish with red pepper to taste and parsley.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Beans: Use whichever sort is the favorite in your neighborhood and likely to be freshest.  In Southern California that would be [[Cookbook:Pinto Bean|pinto beans]], in the deep South, [[Cookbook:Black-Eyed Pea|black-eyed peas]] or perhaps [[Cookbook:Lima Bean|butter beans]]. [[Cookbook:Chickpea|Garbanzos]] might be good. [[Cookbook:Navy Bean|Navy beans]] are always safe.
*Olive oil: Use the best grade you can get:  Cold pressed, Extra Virgin.
*With a salad and some red wine this is a hearty meal, and can be eaten the next day, cold or reheated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../First Order|First Order Differential Equations]]

This section deals with a technique of solving differential equation known as '''Separation of Variables'''. Before we begin discussing separation of variables it is very helpful to recall the theorem behind integration by substitution from calculus.

Which states that if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous function and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; has a derivative that is a continuous function - hence &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; being a function itself, then integrating such chained functions yields
::&lt;math&gt;\int f\big(y(x)\big) y'\,dx = \int f(y)\,dy&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, our integrand &lt;math&gt;f(y(x))y'(x)&lt;/math&gt;  and our antiderivate will be the same if we took the antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and plugged it into &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  This provides a very useful tool to solve many ODE's.

To take an example let's consider the differential equation:
::&lt;math&gt;y'=ay&lt;/math&gt;

We comment the constant function &lt;math&gt;y(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; is a solution.  We will focus on finding solutions that are not zero.  As commented before it is a consequence of the uniqueness of solutions that two solutions can never intersect.  For this problem it means that solutions are always positive or always negative because they cannot cross &lt;math&gt;y(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;. For easier understanding, picture a normal Cartesian coordinate system.  The solutions can only be above or below the x-axis.  

For this reason we are justified for the remainder in assuming that &lt;math&gt;y(x)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus we can divide by &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; as division by zero is undefined, to find that:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{y}y'=a&lt;/math&gt;

Now integrating both sides with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we have that

::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{y}y'\,dx=\int a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Using the theorem about integration by substitution theorem:

::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{y}\,dy=\int a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Or 

:: &lt;math&gt;\ln |y|=ax+C&lt;/math&gt;.
:: &lt;math&gt;y=\pm e^C e^{ax}=Ce^{ax}&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally we comment that, &lt;math&gt;e^c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^c&lt;/math&gt; collapsing to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, so technically speaking the above derivation only shows that we get a solution if &lt;math&gt;C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or if &lt;math&gt;C&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, taking into account &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt;.   Notice on the other hand that if we allow &lt;math&gt;C=0&lt;/math&gt; then we can recover the solution &lt;math&gt;y(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus we can represent all solutions as 
::&lt;math&gt;y(x)=Ce^{ax}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a real number.

This method is known as separation of variables because after we have divided we have one side that is entirely in terms of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and the other side entirely in terms of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  

== Comments about notation and heuristics==
While the change of variables theorem is the mathematical justification, using Leibniz' notation for derivatives allows for excellent mnemonics for remembering how separation of variables works.   

We present two notationally different but equivalent derivations here:

Beginning from the point where we have divided by &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; and using Leibniz notation we have that:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx}=a.&lt;/math&gt;

One might not view this as fully separated because there is still a &quot;dx&quot; on the left hand side.  But one can fully separate the equation by multiplying by &quot;dx&quot;, to get:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{y}\,dy=a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

Then placing an integral in front of each term one gets:
::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{y}\,dy=\int a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.

This arrives at the correct place, but treating &quot;dx&quot; as a number is purely heuristic.

A second mnemonic which is fairly similar uses Leibniz notation to remind us how the change of variables theorem should work.  
Beginning from the step in the original example where we integrated both sides with respect to x, and using Leibniz notation we have: 
::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx}\,dx=\int a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we can &quot;cancel the dx&quot; to get that &lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{\cancel{dx}}\,\cancel{dx}=\int\frac{1}{y}\,dy&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus
::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{y}\,dy=\int a\,dx&lt;/math&gt;.
Again, &quot;dx&quot; is not a number, so it cannot really be canceled.  But the heuristic does correctly give the change of variables formula. 

The reader should use which ever of the above methods seems most clear to them individually.  The book will undoubtedly use anyone of the three at different points in its exposition.

== What is a Separable Equation? ==

An ordinary differential equation is called '''separable''' if it can be rewritten in the form: 

::&lt;math&gt;M(x)+N(y)y'=0&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating both sides with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int M(x)\,dx + \int N(y)y'\,dx = C&lt;/math&gt;

Now by one of the methods we discussed above we can change and simplfy the second integral to 

::&lt;math&gt;\int M(x)\,dx + \int N(y)\,dy = C&lt;/math&gt;

An equation where you can factor out both P and Q into separate functions of x and y

&lt;math&gt;P_1(x)P_2(y)dx+Q_1(x)Q_2(y)dy=0&lt;/math&gt;

is called '''separable''' because the equation can become an equation with separated variables.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac {P_1(x)}{Q_1(x)}dx + \frac {Q_2(y)}{P_2(y)}dy = 0&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac {P_1(x)}{Q_1(x)}dx = - \frac {Q_2(y)}{P_2(y)}dy&lt;/math&gt;

However, attention must be paid to this process of division. The cases when &lt;math&gt;Q_1(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_2(y)=0&lt;/math&gt; will be additional possible integral solutions that will not be found through the integral because of this division.

== Trivial cases ==

There are two special cases of a separable equation that make the solution almost trivial.  These are the cases where either 

::&lt;math&gt;N(y)=k \,&lt;/math&gt;

or 

::&lt;math&gt;M(x)=k, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is a constant.  In either case, the equation changes from being in terms of 3 variables and reduces down to 2.  When we can throw out one of the two variables, the solution can be achieved by a simple integral.

===No ''y'' term: ''N''(''y'') = ''k''===

If ''N''(''y'')=''k'', we can treat ''k'' as part of ''M''(''x''), and turn ''N''(''y'') into 1.  That is, if we divide both sides by ''k'' and let {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''M''(''x'')/''k''}}.  Then we're left with 

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=M(x)/k=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

This is now basic calculus - take the integral of both sides.  The general solution is

::&lt;math&gt;y=\int f(x)dx+C,&lt;/math&gt;

where C is a constant.

Let's take a look at a few examples.

==== Example 1 ====

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=x^2+7&lt;/math&gt;

Here, we have a derivative equaling a function of ''x''. The original function is the '''antiderivative''' of this, that is, we have to integrate to find it. Now we integrate both sides of the equation, w.r.t.''x'' (with regard to 'x'):

::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dy}{dx}\,dx=\int(x^2+7)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{3}x^3+7x+C&lt;/math&gt;

This is the general solution. A function that solves a differential equation is said to '''satisfy''' it, so

::&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1}{3}x^3+7x+C&lt;/math&gt;

satisfies the differential equation

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=x^2+7&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Example 2 ====

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}= \sin x+e^x&lt;/math&gt;

This works the same as before - integrate both sides with respect to ''x''.

::&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dy}{dx}\, dx= \int\sin x+e^x\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y=- \cos x+e^x+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that even in this simple case, it may be impossible to write down a formula for the solution because ''f''(''x'') cannot be integrated in elementary terms.  In this case, writing the integral of ''y'', which is the function we are looking for, symbolically with an integral symbol is deemed to be a solution.

===No ''x'' term: ''M''(''x'')=''k''===

Another special case is when 

::&lt;math&gt;M(x)=k.&lt;/math&gt;

The only difference is how we make it into an integrable form. Our equation is

::&lt;math&gt;N(y)\frac{dy}{dx}= -k.&lt;/math&gt;

This type of equation is called an ''autonomous'' differential equation.  The differential equation has no explicit dependence on the independent variable ''x'' except through the function ''y''.  We will have more to say about this type of equation later, but for the moment we note that this type of equation is always separable. 

Integrating both sides with respect to ''x'' we get

::&lt;math&gt;\int N(y)\frac{dy}{dx}\,dx= \int k\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

We now have two integrals, each with respect to the functions contained in them. The solution is of the form

::&lt;math&gt;\int N(y)\,dy=kx+C.&lt;/math&gt;

You can now try to solve for ''y''. It is possible that the left hand side doesn't have an antiderivative that can be expressed as a nice formula, and in that case, we leave it in a as clean a form as possible, that is with the integral symbol unresolved. Another important concept emerges here. 

==== Example 4 ====

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{k}{y}&lt;/math&gt;

Here we multiply through by ''y'', and multiply through by ''dx''. The rest of the math works as before.

::&lt;math&gt;ydy=kdx \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int ydy=\int kdx \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}y^2=kx+C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y^2=2kx+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, its more convenient to solve for ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; than ''y''.  If we take the square root to solve for ''y'', we change the equation (since the square root of a number is always positive, we would lose half of each solution curve).  In these cases its just fine to leave it in its current form.

You may have noticed that the right hand side of the equation, before solving for ''y'', is the same for both examples.  When ''f''(''x'')=''k'', the right hand side will always be ''kx''+C where ''k'' is whatever constant is in the problem.  It only changes when ''f''(''x'') is not constant.

As before, it may be impossible to do the integral.  Even if it is possible, it may then not be possible to invert the equation to give y explicitly as a function of x, for example if we get tan(y) + 1/y = x.  Again, this does not matter; the result is regarded as a valid solution.

== General Separable Variable Equations==

In the most general case, neither ''M''(''x'') or ''N''(''y'') is a constant.  In this case, we use the same method as before (although the variables might have to be separated first). The only difference is that both sides result in non-trivial integrals, so we a little more work to do.  This can produce some untidy solutions, and ODEs are known for this. This untidiness often means that we might want to check our result at the end.

==== Example 5 ====

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=y^3x&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and multiplying by ''dx'' gives

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{y^3}=xdx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dy}{y^3}=\int xdx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{2y^2}=\frac{1}{2}x^2+C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y^2=-\frac{1}{x^2+C}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 6 ===

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

We multiply by &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{y}&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{y}=\frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dy}{y}=\int\frac{dx}{x} \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\ln(y)=\ln(x)+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y=e^{\ln(x)+C}=e^Ce^{\ln(x)}=Cx \,&lt;/math&gt;

Again &lt;math&gt;e^c&lt;/math&gt; collapsing into &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Example 7 ===

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=xy+y&lt;/math&gt;

This doesn't look separable at first glance.  A little factoring can be applied though:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=(x+1)y&lt;/math&gt;

This is separable.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{y}=(x+1)dx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{dy}{y}=\int(x+1)dx&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\ln(y)=\frac{1}{2}x^2+x+C&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y=Ce^{\frac{1}{2}x^2+x}&lt;/math&gt;

==Problems with Initial Conditions==

Solving an initial value problem is fairly easy.  Solve for ''y'' as we did above. Then once you have the equation, plug in ''b'' for ''y'' and ''a'' for ''x''.  Then, solve for the constant.

=== Example 8 ===

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=ky, \quad y(0)=10&lt;/math&gt;

As we saw in example 3, the general solution to this is ''y''=C''e''&lt;sup&gt;kx&lt;/sup&gt;.  Let's plug in our boundary conditions:

::&lt;math&gt;10=Ce^{0k} \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;10=Ce^{0} \,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;C=10 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;y=10e^{kx} \,&lt;/math&gt;

This is the particular solution.

Unfortunately in some cases care must be used when solving for the constant.

=== Example 9 ===
::&lt;math&gt;2yy'=2x+2\qquad y(0)=-2&lt;/math&gt;
This equation is already separated, so integrating both sides
::&lt;math&gt;\int 2yy'\,dx=\int 2x+2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y^2=x^2+2x+C&lt;/math&gt;

By plugging in we find that:
::&lt;math&gt;C=(-2)^2=4&lt;/math&gt;

So now we have that: 
::&lt;math&gt;y^2=x^2+2x+4.&lt;/math&gt;

But if we continue to solve for ''y'' we must be careful.  One may naively write:
&lt;math&gt;y=\pm\sqrt{x^2+2x+4}.&lt;/math&gt;

But there is a problem, we are looking for a ''function'' ''y''(''x''), which means the function must be single valued (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-valued_function Single-valued function]).  And we should be careful what we mean by &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt;.  
Do we mean that for each different ''x'' there is a different possibility of a sign?

Fortunately since the function has to be differentiable (and hence continuous), the function ''y''(''x'') cannot jump back and forth 
between positive and negative values.  So we must mean there is one choice of sign:
::&lt;math&gt;y=\sqrt{x^2+2x+4};&lt;/math&gt;      Or
::&lt;math&gt;y=-\sqrt{x^2+2x+4}.&lt;/math&gt;

But which one? It is a nice consequence of uniqueness, that only one of the two functions could solve the problem.  Both solve the differential equation, so we can double check the initial condition.  In the first instance ''y''(0)=2, so that is not our solution, but for the second function ''y''(0)=-2 as desired.  Thus the solution is given by:
::&lt;math&gt;y=-\sqrt{x^2+2x+4}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example 10 ===
Another interesting example that illustrates problems that may arise is:
::&lt;math&gt;y'=6xy^{2/3}\qquad y(0)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to solve this initial value problem we begin by separating variables.

::&lt;math&gt;\int y^{-2/3}y'\,dx=\int 6x\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;3y^{1/3}=3x^2+C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2+C)^3&lt;/math&gt;

Now to plug in the initial conditions we have that:
::&lt;math&gt;0=(0^2+C)^3&lt;/math&gt;,  Thus
::&lt;math&gt;C=0&lt;/math&gt;

So we have a solution &lt;math&gt;y(x)=x^6&lt;/math&gt;.  But by inspection we also have the solution &lt;math&gt;y(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  So there are at least two solutions to this problem.  Perhaps there are more, at the moment we have no way to be sure.  Worse, there is nothing that comes up while separating variables to indicate we are in a situation where the situations are not unique.  For this reason we will return to issue and discuss the general mathematical theorems that guarantee the existence of unique solutions.

This may be important for many reasons.  For example, often one believes a real life process is described by a function which satisfies an ODE.  Usually using the ODE, and actual measurements of the process you'd like to deduce what function is governing the process so you can make predictions about future behaviour.  But if the solutions to the ODE are not unique, it is difficult to tell when you have found the one solution which is really giving the behaviour of the real world process.

=== Example 11 ===
In the example above we saw that sometimes a differential equation is not well behaved and admits multiple solutions.  In this example we see that sometimes the problem is perfectly well behaved but if we are not careful we may think we find multiple soluitons.

::&lt;math&gt;y'=4y^{1/2}x\qquad y(0)=4.&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int y^{-1/2}y'\,dx=\int 4x\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;2y^{1/2}=2x^2+C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2+C)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Now by plugging in the initial condition we find that
::&lt;math&gt;4=(0^2+C)^2=C^2&lt;/math&gt;

At this point it is very tempting to claim that:
::&lt;math&gt;C=\pm 2&lt;/math&gt;

And we appear get two solutions 
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2+2)^2&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2-2)^2&lt;/math&gt;

But if we are careful we can see that the second equation is not really a solution.  To see this let's plug it into the equation.

If
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2-2)^2&lt;/math&gt;, then
::&lt;math&gt;y'=4x(x^2-2)&lt;/math&gt;, and 
::&lt;math&gt;y^{1/2}=|x^2-2|&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus when we plug into &lt;math&gt;y'=4y^{1/2}x&lt;/math&gt;  we are trying to equate
::&lt;math&gt;4x(x^2-2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4x|x^2-2|&lt;/math&gt;, 
but notice the first equation is negative for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;x&lt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; while the second equation is always positive.

This doesn't happen for the other function because we end up trying to compare &lt;math&gt;4x(x^2+2)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;y'=4x|x^2+2|&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x^2+2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we can drop the absolute values in the second expression.

So what went wrong?  We introduced the ambiguity when we were solving for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; by squaring both sides of the equation.  We could have avoided this issue if we solved for &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; immediately after integrating, in which case we would have been working with the equation &lt;math&gt;2y^{1/2}=2x^2+C&lt;/math&gt; and: 
::&lt;math&gt;2(4)^{1/2}=2(0)^2+C&lt;/math&gt;, so
::&lt;math&gt;C=4&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this back in and solving for y we get:
::&lt;math&gt;2y^{1/2}=2x^2+4&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y^{1/2}=x^2+2&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;y=(x^2+2)^2&lt;/math&gt;

==Subject-past participle agreement==
This section says: ''When conjugating with être, the past participles of the above verbs must agree with the the subject of a sentence in gender and plurality. Note that there is no agreement if these verbs are conjugated with avoir.''

While this explanation is correct for the type of sentences shown, there is an exception for verbs conjugated with avoir if the participle is preceded by a direct object. In that case, the participle agrees with the gender of the preceding direct object (according to Glanville Price &quot;A Comprehensive French Grammar&quot; p354). Perhaps this is more complication than we need to cover in this lesson, though. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 19:03, 29 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;People began to do things in similar ways (it is a property of human nature to want to belong).&quot;

I'm not sure about this - aren't people more likely to do things the way other people in their civilization do because they've grown up used to that idea and they don't know any other way? For example, people here usually build rectangular doors not because they want to have the same door as everyone else, but because they don't think about any other kind of door. Humans may want to belong, but I don't think that's a main reason behind homogenized cultures. But I didn't edit that because I have no background in psychology or anthropology -- can anyone explain or comment?--[[User:Lady~Macbeth|Lady~Macbeth]] 6 July 2005 20:26 (UTC)

== Persians ==

I found that the section on 'Persians' is under development. I wish to remark here that I'm currently wiriting a book on [[Iranian History]]. You are free to borrow content from my book. Thanks :-) -[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar84]] ([[User talk:Ravichandar84|talk]]) 03:28, 8 February 2008 (UTC)

== Source for dates? ==

According to &quot;Western Civilisations&quot; Lerner,Meacham,Burns 12th ed. [1993] vol. 1 p29 Sargon the Great conquered all of Sumer in 2320BCE and that Sumer gained it's independence in 2130BCE. The date for the conquering in the wikibook is 2125BCE. There seems to be a discrepency here! does anyone know the source for the date and others mentioned in the wikibook?

== Criticism of content priorities ==

In my belief too much information is given regarding Sargon the Great and his descendents and their respective campaigns. This is supposed to be a world history, not a political history of Sumer. The time would be better spent on describing what life was like for the inhabitants of Sumer and on important technical innnovations such as the wheel, the lunar calendar and writing. And whilst we are on the subject of writing: what is all that guff about the Georgian Asomtavruli alphabet. It surely does not deserve a place in a brief History of Mesopotamia

also see my critique of the structure in the talk page of World History

[[User:Zfishwiki|Zfishwiki]] ([[User talk:Zfishwiki|talk]]) 18:38, 28 April 2010 (UTC)

== Sources? ==

Could someone provide sources for the following?

From an anthropological viewpoint Sumerians belonged to the Caucasian, Mediterranean, Balkan European race.

For instance, the ancient Asomtavruli alphabet of the modern Georgian language has ethno-cultural contacts with the Sumerian world.

But Sumerian did not confide the Semites with the Majuscule alphabet, the secret spiritual alphabet that has a lot of similarity to ancient Georgian Asomtavruli alphabet

the Semites inhabiting the town of Akkad conquered Sumer and made the Sumerian scientists create an alphabet for them

 my big question is isn't the Abyssinian kingdom an ancient civilization i have read a lot about abyssinian(ethiopian) kingdom when i wrote my paper &amp; i have read that ethiopian civilization dates many  years back before christ birth. evidences for this are;1, Diodorus Siculus bkii, says that egypt was a colony of ethiopia &amp; the lows &amp; script of both lands were the same but the hieroglyphic script was universal in ethiopia but confined in priestly clasess alone in egypt,2; Herodotuss called ethiopians &quot;wise men occuping upper nile, men of long like, whose manners &amp; customs pertain to the golden age those virtous mortals whose feasts &amp; banquets ownerd by jupiter him self&quot; in greek times egyptians depicted ethiopia as an ideal state
3; the puranas,the ancient historical books of india speaks of the civilization of ethiopia as being older than that of egypt. This Sanskirt books mention the names of old kushite kings that were worshiped in india &amp; who were adopted &amp; changed to suit the fancy of the later people of greece &amp; rome.

==Some of the sentences read confusingly to me==
I feel I am of least average intelligence with decent comprehension.  Yet I feel some of the sentences are incomprehensible.  Too many facts crammed into one sentence perhaps.  For example - 
&quot;
The first known mention of Akkad is in an inscription of Enshakushanna of Uruk, where he claims to have defeated Agade—indicating that it was in existence well before the days of Sargon of Akkad, who the Sumerian kinglist claims to have built it.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transcendence addresses the nature of God to act within history, ''while being above human history''.  The Christian faith in Jesus illuminates this idea.  On the one hand, the presence of Jesus (for the Christian) reflects God's intervention in the world to provide hope and salvation.  On the other hand, Christians also believe that Jesus arose from the dead, and as such is observing human history without directly manipulating it.  So for the Christian, Jesus is considered transcendental.  Prayer reflects the hope that God will once again intervene in the course of human affairs, and influence a favorable outcome.

In developing a deeper understanding of transcendence, it is important for the theist to reconcile additional views of God's intervention in human history with the established idea of humanity's &quot;free will.&quot;

The idea is to try to create a normative index to all these pages, while merging any duplicate content. It should include information on common conventions and practises. This may already exist somewhere else. Add it to the lists and categories of Wikibooks, and try to get it linked from the main page, since the main page doesn't really tell you what the site is all about, and the other pages are somewhat disorganised.

      <comment>popular tools to support configuration management; some related jargon; etc.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is the Wikipedia description of [[Wikipedia:Configuration management | configuration management]].

Assessing the size of the development team and the scope of the
development are two things that need to be identified
very early in the project.  The larger the team, the more important it is to develop a configuration management
strategy that keeps the developers moving without stepping on each
others' toes (having a tool that supports a local developer sandbox,
integration, and release areas automatically as opposed to &quot;making them
by hand&quot;, like we've always done). The more complicated the development, the more complicated the configuration management strategy.  
Specifically, is support of multiple releases of the same product
necessary?  If so, a heavier weight configuration management strategy (one that supports
branching) is more desirable.

Being able to automatically re-create software from the
baseline repository is a ''must'', independent of size of project or team.
It provides product predictability expected of manufacturing processes.

Some popular tools to support configuration management include:
* Makefile and make: Originally these were designed to allow a programmer to tweak one source file and then type &quot;make&quot; to regenerate all the executables, without having to remember the exact name of each and every source file or the exact compile-time options for each one. Today, many programmers also include regression tests in the Makefile.
* distributed version control systems. A programmer uses a VCS to pull the latest version (tip) from the repository into a sandbox (also called a working directory), test it out, make some changes, and then commit any improvements back into the repository.
* ...

I hate postmodernism, I loathe every sentence of it. Nevertheless since it's so prevelant amongst sociologists a nod in the direction of Foccaults views of medicine might be neccessary. 

==Additional Topics Might Include==
*STDs
*Euthanasia
*theory:
**Structural-Functional – defines healthy
**Sick people are exempt from normal responsibilities
**Sick people need to want to get well
**Sick people need to seek help
**Symbolic Interaction
**Illness is socially constructed
**Social-Conflict
**Health care is a commodity under capitalism
**Profit Motive
**Politics of medicine

Please be aware that there has already been extensive work on the [[Portuguese|Portuguese Language Wikibook ]] on grammar. Maybe instead of creating a second book we could combine the two?? - [[User:Serge|Serge]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">This web text is a reference for all topics in the mechanics of multibody systems. A format similar to that of an encyclopedia has been adopted to clearly take advantage of web style referencing and encourage other authors to add new topics or complete existing ones where they are lacking.

A topic is deemed complete when it includes the following elements:
* an overview of the method or operation outlining its application.
* a complete analytical description (and derivation where appropriate).
* example of computational implementation (in a MATLAB and Octave compatible m-file).

1/ Green
2/ Red
5/ Grey
&lt;br&gt; (The 2/ and 5/ are very hard to find.)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1882 Second Sidefaces:

1/2d Black
1d Red
2d Purple
21/2d Blue
3d Yellow
4d Green
5d Grey
6d Brown
8d Blue
1/ Chestnut

==&lt;center&gt;'''1898 Pictorials'''&lt;/center&gt;==

3d Huias
4d Terraces
5d Otira
6d Kiwi (green)
8d Canoe
9d Terraces

2/ Milford
5/ Mt Cook
&lt;br&gt;
Notes: Four stamps from this set can also be found overprinted OFFICIAL: 3d Huias, 1/ Kaka, 2/ Milford and 5/ Mt Cook.
&lt;br&gt;
The 21/2d Wakatipu can also be found with the spelling variation &quot;Wakitipu&quot;, These are not hard to find and are most commonly seen unused.
&lt;br&gt;
The 5/ Mt Cook is not scarce but it is difficult to find in good condition with a regular cancellation. Fiscally used embossed, circular &quot;crown&quot; cancels, or pen cancels are common and worth much less than catalogue value, One leading NZ dealer sells fiscally used copies for $35NZ which is less than 1/20th of the catalogue price. Also beware of &quot;mint no gum&quot; of this stamp as most are fiscally used with the pen cancel cleaned off.

=Separable Variables: Real-World Examples=

This page gives some examples of where simple separable variable DEs are found in the world around us.

__TOC__

== Acceleration, velocity, and position ==

The classic real world example of differential equations is the relationship between acceleration, velocity, and position.

::&lt;math&gt;a(t)=v'(t)=x''(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

So if you're given an equation for acceleration, you can figure out both velocity and position.


===Example 1 - Constant Acceleration ===

Lets say that accelearation is a constant, g  (the acceleration due to gravity, or about 10 m s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.  The initial velocity at ''t''=0 is ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  The initial position is ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Solve for ''v'' and ''x''.

First, you need to solve for ''v''. I.w.r.t.''x''.

::&lt;math&gt;v'=a=g \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int v' dv=\int g dt \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;v=gt+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now plug in to find C.

::&lt;math&gt;v_0=g \times 0+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C=v_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;v(t)=gt+v_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now we solve for ''x''.

::&lt;math&gt;x'=v=gt+v_0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\int x' dt=\int (gt+v_0)dt&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_0t+C&lt;/math&gt;

Again, now we solve for C.

::&lt;math&gt;x_0=\frac{1}{2}g \times 0^2+v_0 \times 0+C&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;x_0=C \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;x(t)=-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_0t+x_0&lt;/math&gt;

Anyone who has studied physics will recognize this as the basic equation for position for an object undergoing a constant force in one dimension.

===Example 2 - Resistive Medium ===

Lets say we're traveling through a medium that resists movement.  In this medium, &lt;math&gt;a=-v^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Solve for ''v'' and ''x'', given that the initial velocity was 10 m/s and the initial displacement was 0 m.

::&lt;math&gt;a=v'=-v^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt}=-v^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{v^2}dv=\int -1 dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{v}=-t+C&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{1}{t+C}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that as ''t'' increases, velocity decreases.  This is what you'd expect if the medium was resisting your movement and slowing you down over time. Now substitute in the initial velocity at ''t''=0

:&lt;math&gt;10=\frac{1}{0+C}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{1}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{1}{t+0.1}&lt;/math&gt;

Now to solve for ''x''.

:&lt;math&gt;v=x'=\frac{1}{t+0.1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{1}{t+0.1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{1}=\frac{dt}{t+0.1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int 1 dx=\int \frac{1}{t+0.1} dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=ln(t+0.1)+D \,&lt;/math&gt;

The position increases throughout, but it increases ever more slowly as time goes on.  This is again what you'd expect for a medium resisting motion.  Since velocity is never less than 0, we never stop going forward, but we go exponentially less far over time. Putting in our boundary conditions,

:&lt;math&gt;0=ln(0+0.1)+D \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;D=-ln(0.1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=ln(t+0.1)-ln(0.1)=ln(10t+1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

== Exponential Growth and Decay ==

One of the most common differential equations in science is 

:&lt;math&gt;y'=ky \,&lt;/math&gt;. 

The solution to this is

:&lt;math&gt;y=Ce^{kt} \,&lt;/math&gt;. 

If ''k'' is positive, this is called exponential growth.  If ''k'' is negative, its exponential decay.  Both are used in science, for very different reasons.

=== Population Growth ===

Lets say we have a group of animals in the wild.  We want to know how many animals there will be in ''t'' years.  We know how many there are now.  We also know the birth rate and death rate.  Can we solve this problem?

Of course we can.  First, we need to figure out the rate of growth.  If the birth rate is B, and the death rate is D, the total rate of change is (B-D).  Since this is the rate, we need to multiply it by the current population to get the population growth.  The final equation looks like

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P=(B-D)P \,&lt;/math&gt;

where P is the population. That looks like the equation for exponential growth, doesn't it?  As a matter of fact, change the 'delta' to a differential, and it is.  The growth factor is (B-D).  

==== Example 3 ====

:In a certain population of rabbits, the birth rate is 10%.  The death rate is 15%.  The initial population is 100.  How many rabbits are there after 10 years?  Will we always have rabbits?

From our solution to the exponential equation:

::&lt;math&gt;P=Ce^{(B-D)t} \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;100=Ce^{(B-D)\times 0}=Ce^0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C=100 \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;P=100e^{-0.05t} \,&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;P(10)=100e^{-0.5}\approx 61&lt;/math&gt;

Unfortunately, we will not always have rabbits.  Since the growth rate is negative, they will eventually go extinct.  (Note:  we will never actually hit 0, but in real life you can't have less than 1 rabbit.  If we were measuring a continuous property instead of a discrete one, we would always have something, it would just get very small).

=== Radioactive Decay ===

Another situation for exponential growth is radioactive isotopes.  If you have a sample of radioactive material, individual atoms will randomly decay or not decay.  While you can't know exactly how many atoms decay and when, you do know the average rate of decay.  Every &amp;lambda; years, half of the atoms left will decay.  This period of time, &amp;lambda;, is called a half life. The ''activity'' of the sample (how many decays per second) is called A. Mathematically, this looks like

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dA}{dt}=\lambda A&lt;/math&gt;

These problems look just like the problem above.  Just like rabbits, we will eventually run out of radioactive atoms as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page provides general information about configuring a wireless hotspot.

== Components ==
Wireless networks require hardware, and to a lesser degree, software.

=== Hardware ===
At a minimum, the following are needed:

*A router — This typically connects to a high-speed internet connection and manages the network's communication with the Internet. If you're dealing with a network not connected to the Internet (Rare), a switch or hub may be used. If you're only connecting two computers to each other (An &quot;Ad Hoc&quot; network), only adapters are needed.
*Adapters for each machine on the network — These will be expansion cards for  desktop computer and [[w:PCMCIA|PCMCIA]] cards for laptops.

If you have a large area to cover, separate antennas and/or access points may be needed.

=== Software ===
All computers on the network need to have an operating system version (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc) that can deal with wireless networking.

* All Windows from 98 on have some degree of ability in this field. 98, ME and 2000 require additional software and drivers. XP with the latest updates from Microsoft will work automatically with many network cards, Vista will work natively.
* Mac OS 9 has some wireless networking ability, 10 will work natively.
* Most recent Linux kernels have built-in wireless networking capability.

=== Notes ===
Most wireless routers also have 4 Ethernet (Hardwired, conventional networking) ports on them. If you have a machine that you don't or can't put on the new network, consider locating it and the router close together so it can get on the network by a cable.

Both adapters, routers and other ancillary parts can range in price from 20 USD up to several hundred. A good advice is to go with a well known brand, the currently dominant three are [[w:D-link|D-link]], [[w:Linksys|Linksys]] and [[w:Netgear|Netgear]].

== Hardware setup ==
Assuming a basic router-and-clients setup, the following hardware will be needed:

# At least one router
# A wireless adapter for each machine that doesn't already have one (Some laptops have built in antennas)
# A cable and adapter for each machine that will be wired into the network
# Depending on the layout of your house and devices, you may need some repeaters. The following section will explain this.

=== Location of equipment ===
Most likely your router will have to connect to your modem (If you don't have an Internet connection, you can disregard this). If this is in a central location for your planned uses, then you will likely not need anything beyond the router and adapters. If you're installing the modem and are planning to have wireless networking, consider installing it in a central location.

If not, you can run more wiring in your house to get it to the router, or accept a weaker signal in the parts of the house farther from the router. If this is an issue, you may want to invest in a repeater that can bring your wireless signal to the far corners of your house.

As discussed previously, wireless signal strength is of significant importance. Some points of information about signals and permeability:

*Wireless signals can pass through drywall relatively easily, but if it must pass through a significant number of walls the signal will degrade rapidly.
*Wireless signals do not travel well through cinder block walls.
*Wireless signals can be disrupted by ducts of a climate control system.
*Water can greatly distort wireless signals.  Take into account aquariums, sinks, and water pipes.  Remember, the human body is 66% water, so locations with a high density of people can distort wireless signals. This also includes rain or humidity, so consider bath/shower rooms or other regularly wet areas.

If you want coverage outdoors (which can be very nice during good weather with a laptop!), consider locating the router or a repeater near a window facing the direction you want to cover. An upper floor can be an excellent place for a router or signal propagator for coverage around the outside of the building, and possibly inside as well.

=== Wiring up the router ===
Most residential routers are fairly simple to set up and have standardized markings. The usual setup is this:

# Plug the Ethernet (data) cable from your cable or DSL modem into the &quot;WAN&quot; port (If your modem has USB and Ethernet ports, use the Ethernet port and don't connect anything to the USB port).
# Plug any computers you wish to hard-wire to your router to one of the &quot;LAN&quot; ports. If every computer is to connect wirelessly, skip this step.
# If possible, disconnect the antenna, or shield it from transmission.
# Shut off/unplug your modem for about 15 seconds
# Restore power to your modem
# Plug in your router

The above steps '''may''' or '''may not''' cause the router to obtain an internet connection from the modem. These are VERY generic steps, which will ''sometimes'' work if the user's Internet Service Provider uses DHCP. If not, the router must be manually configured, and only the physical connections listed here will be of use to the user.

After a few seconds (At most), the router should start up with the default settings. Leave the antenna disconnected/blocked until you've had a chance to change the wireless security settings, as router defaults are notoriously insecure.

===Router configuration===
The vast majority of residential routers are configured by a &quot;web-based interface&quot; (A webpage which you can view with Firefox or IE or whatever you use to surf the web).

To access this webpage, a special address (called an [[w:IP address|IP address]]) is used. This is normally detailed in the users manual or &quot;quick start guide&quot;. The username and password to be used are also listed. If a &quot;quick start wizard&quot; comes up, you can follow it through or dismiss it. The rest of this guide assumes that it didn't appear or was dismissed.

Once logged in to the router, the first steps should be to strengthen the security. See below...

Expansion cards should be installed with the computer turned off. PCMCIA cards for laptops can be inserted at any time. If the operating system doesn't automatically detect and set up the new networking hardware, try using the disc that came with it.

What is the purpose of this article?

Is this article about system behavior and the major types of systems or is it specifically about IT systems?

Is this supposed to be a monlogue against the Great Satan, Microsoft, or is it supposed to be about systems theory?

There appears to be too much emphasis on IT systems with quite a bit of half baked philosophy thrown in.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Oniony. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Oniony~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Robots need some form of artificial intelligence in order to be able to navigate around a room or to solve a problem. Such AI can range from simple, as in following particular rules when a specific input is received, through more complicated, as in fuzzy logic rules or simple neural nets, to complicated, as in state of the art machine learning methods.

How complicated you can make your AI depends on a few factors:
*Processing power: How fast is your microprocessor, is it 8-, 16-, or 32-Bit, How many microprocessors do you use?
*Available memory: Both temporary and &quot;permanent&quot; memory. Limited amounts of memory restrict how much data can be held at a time, e.g. a map of the surroundings, sensor history, movement history. Systems with much permanent storage and little ram are slower than systems with large amounts of ram.
*Your knowledge: AI is a very broad subject. Parts of it are very math intensive and can be tricky to understand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Notation ==

There are several notations; please refer to this
[http://www.vanderblonk.com/tutorial/before-you-start#notation notation guide].

Briefly:

* There are six sides to the cube, presented as Front, Back, Left, Right, Up and Down. They are usually referred to by their one-letter abbreviations.
* In the isometric diagrams below, where a corner points out at you, you see the F, R and U sides. The F faces to the left.
* Movements are presented as one quarter rotation (90 degrees) of an external face per movement. This means that the center tile colors are not changed. In our diagrams, F is blue, R is red and U is yellow. The other three colors are typically orange opposite red, green opposite blue and white opposite yellow
* Quarter-rotations of that face's layer default to clockwise. Counter-clockwise rotations are often referred to as &quot;inverted&quot; and indicated by &amp;prime;, for instance, R&amp;prime;. (The &amp;prime; is commonly read as &quot;prime&quot;, &quot;apostrophe&quot;, &quot;tick mark&quot;, &quot;anti-clockwise&quot;, &quot;anti&quot; or &quot;i&quot; for inverted). Half-rotations (180 degrees) are indicated by the digit &quot;2&quot;, for instance, R2 (meaning 2 quarter-rotations following the one-letter abbreviation).
* To see what is happening on the sides of the other three colors, rotate the cube as a whole, described as rotating along the ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' space axis, all pointing out of the page. ''x'' is R, ''y'' is U and ''z'' is F, but since this sort of move also changes the colors of the center-tiles, it is used sparingly.

== Example solve ==

As an example, let's consider a complete solve. 25 move scrambles are used to mix up the cube. Our sample scramble is:

: U B&amp;prime; R2 D&amp;prime; U&amp;prime; R U2 B R&amp;prime; B2 L2 R F2 R2 U2 R B U2 F2 L2 F2 D R B2 R2 ([http://vanderblonk.com/cube/cubeapplet.asp?alg=UB'R2D'U'RU2BR'B2L2RF2R2U2RBU2F2L2F2DRB2R2&amp;scripttype=Generator demo: scramble])

The solve is:

: R&amp;prime; B R D2 F2 L U&amp;prime; F U R&amp;prime; D R F D F&amp;prime; F&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; F U2 R&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; R U2 U&amp;prime; F&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; F U U B&amp;prime; D&amp;prime; B U&amp;prime; ''y''2 F D2 F2 R F R&amp;prime; B&amp;prime; D F D&amp;prime; B D F&amp;prime; F2 D M D2 M&amp;prime; D F2 (54 moves, [http://vanderblonk.com/wp-content/plugins/rubik/cubeapplet.php?initscript=UB'R2D'U'RU2BR'B2L2RF2R2U2RBU2F2L2F2DRB2R2&amp;alg=R'BRD2F2LU'FUR'DRFDF'F'D'FU2R'D'RU2U'F'D'FUUB'D'BU'y2FD2F2RFR'B'DFD'BDF'F2DMD2M'DF2&amp;scriptType=Generator demo])

*[[/Beginner2|Beginner CFOP]]
--&gt;

== Classical Methods ==

The first widely publicized solutions to the Rubik's Cube appeared in the early 1980s, when quite a number of solutions where published in books and articles. For example, see 
[http://helm.lu/cube/MarshallPhilipp/page_1.htm Philip Marshall's comparison] of various classical methods. Here we mention two solutions from around 1981 by
David Singmaster&lt;ref name = &quot;Singmaster&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Singmaster|first=David|title=Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube|year=1981|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-907395-00-7|location=Harmondsworth, Eng}}&lt;/ref&gt;,
and James Nourse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube]]|last= Nourse|first= James G.|year=1981 |publisher= Bantam|location= New York|isbn= 0-553-14017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

One of the key observations was that the solution can be broken down into several steps. Most of the &quot;standard&quot; classical approaches solve the cube layer by layer. For example, solve
1. all edges in the top layer, 2. the corners in the top layer, 3. the edges in the middle or horizontal layer, 4. the edges in the bottom layer, and 5. the corners in the bottom layer,
which completes the solution. There is a number of relevant variations, for example step 2 and 3 can be combined (see the Fridrich method below), or step 5 is often split into first putting the pieces in the right place and then fixing their orientation. The bottom line is that such steps simplify the solution process because there exist algorithms (sequences of face turns) that can handle the individual steps efficiently. Solution methods differ not only in the steps, but also in the set of algorithms suggested for the individual steps. 

As [http://helm.lu/cube/MarshallPhilipp/page_1.htm Marshall discusses], many of the more recent methods have their roots in these early solutions. This is also apparent in several of the methods that are listed below, which however include a number of improvements. The solution steps have been modified, and the sets of algorithms have been improved and optimized for different solutions steps. Furthermore, some of the early methods were not fully explained (or had gaps), and many improvements in presentation were made.

In the following we comment on beginner methods, where the goal is simplicity (usually at the cost of efficiency), and on advanced methods, which give faster and/or shorter solutions (usually at the cost of increased complexity).

== Beginner Methods ==

The term ''beginner method'' is used differently by different authors. A beginner method should be simple, but what is considered simple depends on the person, and changes quickly as experience is gained. 
As [http://helm.lu/cube/MarshallPhilipp/page_1.htm Marshall] discusses, some of the early simple methods required 10 to 20 algorithms and needed 100 to 150 moves to solve the cube. For example, he reports an average of 110 moves for Nourse's method with 12 algorithms, which comes down to 100 moves adding shortcuts involving 20 algorithms in total.

A modern method could be called simple if it only needs 5 algorithms or less. If you are used to advanced methods with 50 plus algorithms, then 10 or less is also simple. Also, the algorithms should not be too long and complicated themselves. Some of the recent beginner methods with 5 or less moves are surprisingly efficient, requiring less than 100 and in some cases only about 70 moves. This is quite nice compared to some advanced speedcubing methods that require 40 to 60 moves or so on average but use 50 plus algorithms.

=== Recent beginner methods ===

'''Solution guide at Rubiks.com''': The guide at the official Rubik's site seems to be one of the classic layer-by-layer methods. It lists 14 algorithms. The version retrieved was dated 2010. 
[http://eu.rubiks.com/solving-guide/3x3]

'''Heise's beginner method''': This is a representative example of an optimized, classical layer-by-layer method. The original strategy is credited to David Singmaster. It requires four algorithms. 
(Some of the easy steps are labeled intuitive and not counted as algorithms, but this is common practice.) The solution is presented with the help of animations. [http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/beginner.html]

'''Wikibook beginner CF method''': Presented on [[/Beginner|these wikibook pages]], this layer-by-layer method uses 5 to 8 algorithms, depending on how you count them. Although perhaps not optimal in the number of algorithms, it demonstrates a rather successful idea. Only 3 of 4 corner pieces and 3 of 4 edge pieces are solved in the first two layers. Leaving those pieces as free workspace can simplify some of the later steps. See the Petrus method below for the classical example of a block building method that avoids solving certain pieces too early. [Missing an original reference to this &quot;Beginner CF&quot; method.]

'''8355 method''': Another layer-by-layer method using two pieces as workspace. Requires 3 algorithms. In this case the workspace allows a simplification compared to, say, Heise's beginner method.[https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/8355_Method]

'''Philip Marshall's method''': An edges-first method that relies on only 2 algorithms. Reported to require only 65 moves on average by Marshall. Notice that the above layer-by-layer with workspace methods can be turned into edges-first methods if solving the three corners of the first layers is delayed until all edges have been solved. The Marshall method achieves its simplicity by using one particular 4-turn algorithm to do all the edges, and one 8-turn algorithm for the corners. Some elementary setup turns are needed as well. [http://helm.lu/cube/MarshallPhilipp]

'''Single algorithm methods''': The 8355 method and Marshall method can be reduced to single algorithm methods, see the [http://cube.crider.co.uk/beginner.php Single Alg Cube Solution] and the [https://bbprojx.net/cube/summary.html Y-move method]. Basically, there are two elementary 4-turn commutators, the [https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Sexy_move &quot;S-move&quot;] and the [https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Y-Move_Method &quot;Y-move&quot;], which are used in these and other methods to solve the edges. It turns out that these commutators can also be applied repeatedly to replace the corner algorithms in the 8355 and Marshall method. There is a small loss of efficiency, but in this way single algorithm methods are possible. The first single algorithm method was originally developed by Camilo Vladimir de Lima Amaral[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBkka-fhgg4&amp;list=UU--QBHLCtx7kgiukctIjSUQ], who called it &quot;Less is more method&quot; or &quot;Amaral Method&quot; [https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Less_is_More].

Are there zero algorithm methods? The answer is yes since single face turns are not counted as algorithms, and the cube can certainly be solved with those. However, the idea of algorithms is to group single face turns into something manageable by humans. Relying only on &quot;intuition&quot; and single face turns has not led to a beginners method yet.

In conclusion, there are several recent beginner methods that improve on the classical layer-by-layer beginner's methods, although simple can mean different things. Simple methods with just 1 to 4 algorithms are possible, where the main point is that this is less than 10 or 20. Still, a beginner may prefer a printed list of 5 or 10 algorithms over a less explicit method using only a 1 or 2 algorithms. On the other hand, a method with fewer algorithms is easier to memorize and easier to understand than a more complex method.

&quot;Algorithms of last layer&quot;:Some algorithms of fixing last layer- 

1.Making cross-(F R U R' U' F')

2.Matching edge colours-(R U R' U R 2U R')

3.Fixing corners-(U R U' L' U R' U' L)

4.Matching corners-(D R' D' R)

== Faster methods ==

While the above methods may be good for a beginner, they are too slow to be used in [[w:speedcubing|speedcubing]]. The most popular method for speedcubers is very similar to the Beginner CF method above, except steps 2 and 3 are combined, and the last layer is solved in two steps instead of three. The inventor of this common method is [[w:Jessica Fridrich|Jessica Fridrich]]. With this method, speedcubers with good dexterity and memory can average under 20 seconds after a few months of hard practice. However, to learn the method you must learn 78 algorithms. There are methods just as fast that require far fewer algorithms to be memorized. Here is a brief synopsis of several popular [[w:speedcubing|speedcubing]] methods:

=== Layer by Layer methods ===

'''Fridrich Method:''' A very fast First 2 Layers (or F2L) method, start by solving a cross on one face, then proceeding to solve the First 2 Layers pairing up edge and corner combinations and putting them into their ''slot''. This is followed by solving the Last Layer in two steps, first orienting all pieces (one color on the last layer), then permuting them (solving the ring around the last layer). The basic method has 78 algorithms (without the inverse of them), and is recognized as one of the fastest methods currently in use. [http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cube.html]

'''F2L Alternatives:''' Methods that follow the same principle as Fridrich's method, but using different algorithms. Many of the algorithms are shared but there are a few differences, so there should be one to suit your fingers:
* Bob Burton: [http://www.cubewhiz.com/]
* Shotaro 'Macky' Makisumi: [http://cubefreak.hp.infoseek.co.jp/]
* Speedcubing.com Collection: speedcubinglovers.com

'''ZB method:''' [[/ZB|This method]] was developed independently by [[w:Ron van Bruchem|Ron van Bruchem]] and [[w:Zbigniew Zborowski|Zbigniew Zborowski]] in 2003. After solving the cross and three c/e pairs, the final F2L pair is solved while orienting LL edges. This is known as ZBF2L. The last layer can then be solved in one algorithm, known as ZBLL. The ultimate method requires several hundred algorithms. [[w:Lars Vandenbergh|Lars Vandenbergh]]'s site has ZBF2L algorithms, used in his VH system. [http://www.cubezone.be/zbf2l.html] ZBLL algorithms can be found on Doug Li's webpage. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dlli/Hardwick/zbll.html]

'''ZZ method:''' [[/ZZ|This method]] was created in 2006 by Zbigniew Zborowski, the co-creator of the ZB method. It has three basic steps: EOLine, F2L, and LL. [http://cube.crider.co.uk] [http://www.emsee.110mb.com/Speedcubing/ZZ%20speedcubing%20system.html] EOLine stands for Edge Orientation Line. The orientation of edges is defined as either good or bad. Good meaning the edge can be placed into the correct position with a combination of R, L, U, D, F2, or B2, moves. Bad meaning it would require an F, F&amp;prime;, B, or B&amp;prime; move to be moved into its correct position. Any F, F&amp;prime;, B, or B&amp;prime; move will cause the four edges on that slice to change from its current state, good or bad, to the opposite state. The Line portion of EOLine is forming a line on the bottom of the cube that consists of the DB edge and the DF edge in their correct positions. The next step is F2L, First 2 Layers. It uses block building techniques to solve the two remaining 1x2x3 blocks of the F2L using only R, U, and L moves. This allows for very quick solving of F2L as it does not require cube rotation. The final step of the ZZ method is LL, Last Layer, and it can be broken into multiple steps or maintained as one depending on the algorithms used. There are two main approaches to this method OLL [http://cubefreak.net/speed/fourlook.html] and PLL [http://jmbaum.110mb.com/pll.htm], Orientation of LL and Permutation of LL, and COLL [http://jmbaum.110mb.com/coll.htm] and EPLL [http://cubefreak.net/speed/fourlook.html], Corner OLL and Edge PLL. The first, OLL and PLL, is to use one of 7 algorithms to solve the top layer (OLL) and then permute the edge and corners into their correct positions (PLL), this requires 21 algorithms. The total algorithms required for the first approach of solving LL is 28. The second approach to solving LL is to solve the top and the corners in one algorithm (COLL) and then solve the edges (EPLL). COLL requires 40 algorithms and EPLL requires 4, making the total 44 algorithms. The second approach is faster due the ease of recognition and speed of execution of EPLL.

'''VH method:''' Created by [[w:Lars Vandenbergh|Lars Vandenbergh]] and [[w:Dan Harris|Dan Harris]], as a stepping stone from Fridrich to ZB. First, F2L without one c/e-pair is solved with Fridrich or some other method. Then the last pair is paired up, but not inserted. Then it's inserted to F2L and LL edges are oriented in one go. Then, using COLL, corners of LL are solved while preserving edge orientation. Then edges are permuted. [http://www.cubestation.co.uk/cs2/]

=== Block methods ===

'''Petrus System:''' Created by [[w:Lars Petrus|Lars Petrus]]. One of the shortest methods in terms of face turns per solve, the [[/Petrus|Petrus method]] is often used in fewest moves contests. Petrus reasoned that as you construct layers, further organization of the cube's remaining pieces is restricted by what you have already done. For a layer-based solution to continue after constructing the first layer, the solved portion of the cube would have to be temporarily disassembled while the desired moves were made, then reassembled afterwards. Petrus sought to get around this [[w:quagmire|quagmire]] by solving the cube outwards from one corner, leaving him with unrestricted movement on several sides of the cube as he progressed. There are not as many algorithms to learn compared to the other F2L methods, but it takes a lot of dedication to master. The basis of the method is to create a 2 × 2 × 3 block on the cube, then proceed to solve a 3 × 3 × 2 block, but also flipping the edges on the Last Layer. Then the Last Layer is solved in two steps, first corners and then edges. [http://lar5.com/cube/]

'''Heise method:''' Created by [[w:Ryan Heise|Ryan Heise]]. First, one inner square and three outer squares are built intuitively. Then they are placed correctly while orienting remaining edges. After that you create two c/e-pairs, and solve the remaining edges. The last 3 corners are solved using a [[w:commutator|commutator]]. [http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/]

'''Gilles Roux Method:''' Another unique method, but works in blocks like the Petrus method. You start by solving a 1 × 2 × 3 block and then solve another 1 × 2 × 3 block on the other side of the cube. Next you solve the last 4 corners and finally the edges and centers. Has only 24 algorithms to learn. [http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html]

=== Corners first methods ===

'''Waterman Method:''' Created by Mark Waterman. Advanced corners first method, with about 90 algorithms to learn. Solve a face on L, do the corners on R and then solve the edges. An extremely fast method. [http://www.rubikscube.info]

'''Jelinek Method:''' Created by Josef Jelinek. This method is very similar to Waterman's. [http://rubikscube.info/]

Create a solved 2 × 2 × 2 cube on one corner and rotate the remaining blocks (it may take a while but you will eventually solve it).

== Three &quot;Levels of Difficulty&quot; ==

A procedure has been developed whereby a complete beginner can learn and master the Cube by moving up through three self-contained &quot;Levels of Difficulty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McNaughton, D.|title=The Rubik Cube: A three-stage approach to mastering it|journal=Junior News|date=November 1989 - February 1990|publisher=Al-Nisr, Dubai, UAE|url=http://dlmcn.com/rubik2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lowest level deliberately maintains configurations in which every face exhibits horizontal and vertical symmetry, so it also enables a number of &quot;pretty patterns&quot; to be constructed - such as Chequers, Crosses, Stripes and Central 'Dots'. Level Two involves solving cubes which have been scrambled using only 180-degree turns. Techniques acquired in those earlier stages, remain useful when continuing up to the next level.

== Other solution pages ==

Here are some of the more popular solution pages listed. All are different, although they mostly use a similar layer by layer method. Usually you will need Java to see the animations used.

== Home Exercises and Stretching == 

A highly recommended book to start with is Robin McKenzie's &quot;7 Steps to a Pain-Free Life: How to Rapidly Relieve Back and Neck Pain&quot;. These exercises don't help everybody, but for a sizable portion of the population they do a great deal of good.

Also, consult Pete Egoscue's &quot;Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain&quot;. You can also receive expert advice from Postural Restoration Therapists and Posture Alignment Specialists (PAS). See egoscueuniversity.com and posturalrestoration.com

== Other Behavior Modifications == 

Many people with lower back pain find that bad posture while sitting contributes to their pain. A good chair can help alleviate this problem, but a cheaper and more universal solution is a lumbar support roll. These come in many forms, from the home-made to professionally designed solutions sold in most back-pain stores.

A lumbar roll is placed just above the belt line, while sitting up straight in a normal chair. It causes your spine to bend forward in the same way it should naturally, but is often lost with age.

Two easy home alternatives to a lumbar roll is a roll of paper towels (Small sizes work best) or a rolled up towel.

== Overview ==

[[Image:Blender3d-ejemplo_logo_2d.jpg|right|200px]]


We will be using this graphic as a template for a 3d logo, tracing it, then discarding the 2d image. ''(Click thru to get the larger sized version, for you to follow along with)''


{{Clear}}

== Load the background image into blender ==

=== Basics of the background image panel ===
If you haven't already done so, open blender and select one of the orthogonal view angles by pressing '''NUM7''' (top), '''NUM3''' (side), or '''NUM1.''' (front).  At the bottom of the 3D viewport on the left, there are some menus, click '''View''' -&gt; '''Background Image'''

[[Image:blender-background-dialog.jpg|right|200px]]
A small window will appear containing just one button marked '''use background image'''; click this button.  A few more buttons will appear.  One of them says '''image:''' and has a small button with a picture of a folder on it; click this button. You are now presented with a file selection screen. Using the navigation techniques from the previous tutorials, find your 2D jpeg image on your computer, click the file in the list once then click the '''Select Image''' button at the top right of the screen.

Noob note: The image is only displayed in orthogonal view. If perspective view is enabled, toggle to orthogonal view by pressing '''NUM5'''. ''(The image will not be rendered as it is not part of your scene.)''

{{Clear}}

[[Image:Blender_background_image_dialog.JPG|right|200px]]

Once a background is selected you'll have a dialog like this one. (Note: This tutorial was originally generated from Blender v2.37. v2.43 has been added - older versions may differ.) The background dialog buttons are described below:

{{Clear}}

=== Details of the background image panel ===
The [[Image:Blender_use_background_image_button.JPG|inline|Use Background Image Button v2.37]] is a toggle button that turns display of the image on or off. Turning the button off will not clear the settings; it just hides the image. When you turn the button on again, your previous settings are back. Try it - click the button a few times. In v2.43 the equivalent button is the  [[Image:Blender_use_background_image_button_v2p43.JPG|inline|Use Background Image Button v2.43]] button.

Image selection is controlled on the row labeled [[Image:Blender_image_select.JPG|inline|Blender_Image Select v2.37]]. There are 2 buttons, a text box, and a final button. The first button [[Image:Blender_image_select_button1.JPG|inline|Browsing Image Select v2.37]] is used for browsing for an image. The 2nd button [[Image:Blender_image_select_button2.JPG|inline|Image Select History v2.27]]is for selecting an image from a history list. (This will be empty for the first time. Selecting it now will display the image you currently have selected.) The text box [[Image:Blender_image_select_textbox.JPG|inline|Image Select Textbox v2.37]] allows typing in the file directly. The [[Image:Blender_image_remove.JPG|inline|Image Remove]] button removes the current background image. Version 2.43 is the same with the addition of the [[Image:Blender_refresh.JPG‎|inline|Image Refresh]] button that refreshes the image or movie, and the [[Image:Blender_users_count.JPG|inline|Image Users Count]] button which shows the number of users of the image block.

The third row is called Texture and will not be used for this tutorial.

The fourth line, labeled '''blend''' controls the transparency of the background image with a slider. A setting of 0 is completely solid and 1 is completely transparent. You can adjust it by clicking left or right of the knob for gradual changes, clicking and dragging on the slider for rough settings or clicking directly on the '''blend''' text for numeric entry.

The use of the blend function will become obvious once we start tracing our logo. For now, play around with it, see how it changes the image, and put it back to the 0.500 default.

The fifth line,  '''size''', controls the size of the image. This size setting is independent of the zoom for the 3D view window. To see how the size works move the default cube off to the side so that you can see both the cube, the background dialog and the background image. Now watch both the cube and image as you change the size. Notice how the image changes size but the cube doesn't? Now press '''NUM+''' and '''NUM-''' to change the view's zoom. Now both the cube and image change size.

The final row controls the X and Y offset for the image. These controls move the image up and down (Y) or left and right (X). These settings can be useful if you need to reposition the image from the default position. Like the size, these offset values are independent of the view. As you change the offset values the cube you added earlier won't move. Now scroll the view using by clicking and dragging the '''SHIFT MMB''' and notice how the cube and image move together?

Once you start tracing the image you won't be using the size or offset setting.

=== Details for version 2.6X===

the check box left to the title indicate if you can see the image or not.
the ''Axis'' menu indicate in what views you could see the image.

the button ''Image'' and ''Movie Clip'' indicate of course if you use a Image or a Movie.

the button to left of the text box allows to choose the image from the exist, the text box say the name of the image, the F botton make the image a fake user, the folder sign allow to upload a image, and the X sign delete the link to the picture.

The '''blend''' slider mentioned above is now called '''Opacity'''.  The image will be completely transparent when the opacity value is zero, and fully opaque when the value is one.

== Delete the cube ==
Delete the cube (select it, press '''XKEY''' and select '''All''' from the '''Erase''' menu), and set the size so that the entire image is viewable. Then set  both the X and Y offsets to 0. 

Set the view to top view ('''NUM7''') for the rest of the tutorial!

Finally minimize the Background Image dialog. You'll only need it to adjust the blend setting until you finish tracing.

== Introducing the Bezier Curve ==

The [[w:Bézier curve|Bézier Curve]] allows drawing graceful, complex curves and only requires a few points. Specifically, it only requires 4 points for a curve: two end points and two control points. 

For the moment set the blend to 1 on the Background Image dialog. With the center of the 3D view still selected, press '''SPACE -&gt; Add -&gt; Curve -&gt; Bézier Curve'''.  Alternatively you can use the '''Add''' menu at the top of the screen or press '''SHIFT -&gt; AKEY''' to jump directly to the add menu. Be sure to be in EDIT MODE not OBJECT MODE.  

{{Clear}}

[[Image:blender-bezier-curve-initial.PNG|frame|right|The Curve you added.]]

Unlike the traditional Bézier Curve each Bézier vertex has 3 points. I've labeled the 3 points for the left vector: A, B and C.  

Just like any other vertex you select the control points and the end points with '''RMB''' and move them with standard commands like '''GKEY''', '''SKEY''', '''EKEY''' or '''RKEY'''. if you wish to rotate, scale, or move the whole curve, then select all the vertices on the curve using one of the various selection methods, and then use the '''GKEY''', '''SKEY''', or '''RKEY'''

'''Point A''' is an end point. The curve will always go through this point.
'''Points B and C''' are control points. These points influence the path of the curve as it leaves '''Point A'''. Because the path stops at '''A''', '''Point B''' has no real effect on the path. Instead '''B''' is currently locked with '''C'''. (If you move either '''B''' or '''C''', the other will move.) We will ''fix'' '''Point B''' to move independently a little later.

The control points have 2 effects on the path exiting the end point: direction and distance (these are termed slope and magnitude in math circles) from '''Point A'''. The direction will provide the direction that the path will follow when it leaves '''A''' and the distance will determine how long the path follows that direction before it starts making its way to the curve's next point. 

 &lt;!-- these images never seems to have been uploaded[[Image:Beziersharpturn0001.gif|thumb|right|N.B. To easily make sharp turns; take ''B'' point and move it really close to ''A''.]] [[Image:Beziersharpturn0002.gif|thumb|right|Take ''C'' point and move it in the exact direction you want to turn]] [[Image:Beziersharpturn0003.gif|thumb|right|(with ''C'' selected) Press EKEY to ''extend'' the Bezier, and drag it out; you will find it goes where you pointed ''C''! ''--[[User:Jawboot|Jawboot]] 01:30, 30 April 2006 (UTC)'']]--&gt;

{{Clear}}

[[Image:blender-bezier-curve-sample.PNG|right|200px]]
The example to the right shows how the control points influence the path of the curve. In the top picture, we see three curves. The top curve is the default curve. In the next curve down, '''C''' has been moved to give a drastically different direction. Notice how the path leaving '''A''' moves away from the other end point. The third curve, the distance was changed dramatically. Watch the path move much higher than the other two curves.

In the bottom example, I've built a heart shape using just the points shown. ''Dragging the bottom end point down will make the shape closer to a leaf.'' You'll be able to do the same at the end of this tutorial. Go ahead move around the points for the curve and see how they all interact. Get a good feel working with the curve and when you're ready we'll move on to tracing.

Now that you know how to work with a bezier curve set blend back to 0.5 on the Background Image dialog so we can start tracing.

{{Clear}}

== Modeling the lighting bolt ==
=== Rough Tracing ===

If you don't already have a curve add one now. It will help to move the curve to the center of the yellow lightning bolt.

[[Image:blender-curve-tools-convert.PNG|frame|right|Curve Tools for Blender 3D version 2.37]]The first step in tracing is to click the Polygon convert button on the curve tools panel. You'll find this in button on the '''Buttons Window'''. You may need to select the '''Edit Panel'''. Press '''F9''' if this panel isn't visible. 
In Blender 2.59, the 3D View panel's Tool Shelf ('''T''') houses the Curve Tools, including Set Spline Type, from which you should select Poly. You must be in Edit Mode to reach the Curve Tools.

'''Noob Note:'''  The 'Curve Tool' panel will not appear if you don't have a bezier curve already placed.  I learned this the hard way.

{{Clear}}

[[Image:blender-2dlogo-rough-trace-points.png|right|200px]] Next, move the vertices of the curve to the points shown in the image to the left. This is called Rough Tracing because you don't need to exactly trace the image. 

You only need to approximate the image. Moving the vertices should be done using the instructions from the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Creating a Simple Hat|Creating a Simple Hat]] tutorial.

''Note: Selecting the best place to put a vertex is a bit of an art that you'll acquire as you work with curves. For now follow the arrows along the cutouts and place each of the vertices as shown.''

This tracing uses all the vertices of the polygon. Other cases, you'll need add or remove extra vertices by selecting the end point of your curve press '''CTRL''' and click '''LMB'''. At the place you clicked a new vertex will appear connected to your curve.

{{Clear}}


[[Image:blender-2dlogo-rough-trace-final.png|right|200px]]
After moving the last vertex, we finish the rough tracing by pressing the Alt+'''CKEY''' to close the polygon. You should see an image similar to the one on the right. (If you only have an outline switch your view port shading to solid by pressing the '''ZKEY''' for now.)


'''Question''': how do you close the polygon in blender 2.61? '''Answer'''_ ALT + CKEY  pressing c key alone brings up circle select.

''Note: In Blender 2.63 and certain prior versions, the curve needs to be changed from 3D to 2D shape in order for the polygon to show up, else you get an error. This can be changed by going into Object Data and, under the Shape heading, switching the curve from 3D to 2D.''

Notice how the polygon doesn't cover all of the yellow of the bolt and how in some places the polygon fails to conform to the shape of the bolt. This is expected and should not be a cause for concern. We correct this in the next section.

{{Clear}}


Once you've finished several logos you should begin to get a feel for the required placement of vertices. Until then, here are some general guidelines to keep in mind:

* A gradual curve may only require a single vertex.
* Tight curves will likely require two closely placed vertices.
* Curves may not require a vertex at all - you can define some curves using the control points of the adjacent vertices. We did this for both of the inside curves of the bolt above.
* Corners require a single vertex placed where the curve bends. A square, for instance, requires four vertices - one at each corner - to be modeled properly. 
* The end point of a curve will always be on the curve. So should all of the vertices you place.
  
We are now ready to move onto the next step modeling the logo.

=== Polishing the Tracing ===

Press '''ZKEY''' to return to wire frame mode, then Press the '''Bézier''' convert button to convert the polygon back to a curve. 

This will convert your polygon back into a curve. Nothing obvious will happen. If you look close, you should notice the number of points on the curve tripled. When you converted the curve back to a Bézier curve, Blender changed all of the polygon vertices to Bézier vertices. While the polygon vertex is a single point the Bézier vertex is made of an end point and 2 control points. So the extra points are the control points of the Bézier vertices. These control points are placed along the curve to produce the same shape as the converted polygon.

[[Image:blender-2dlogo-polish-position-control-points.png|right|150px]] Our job is to move the control and end points so that the curve follows the edge of the bolt. The trick is to move the 2 control points between adjacent end points to bend the curve to the edge of bolt. First, move the right control point of the top-left vertex. This should pull the curve from its end point to more closely match the line of our bolt. After placing this point, we move to the next control point following a clockwise direction around the bolt. Use the '''RMB''' to select the point you want to change and move it with '''GKEY''' to place it.

'''Noob Note:''' if you wind up with pink lines when you select the contral handels, that means you hit '''HKEY''' by accident, and have put the control point in manual. to correct this hit '''HKEY''' again to put it back into &quot;easy&quot; or auto mode.

As you move the second point notice how the curve exiting the first end point is drawn away from the edge of the bolt being traced. We now have to adjust the first control point again to get that line back on track. This quickly turns into a balancing act adjusting each set of control points. The trick is to make smaller movements for each iteration of adjustments. Make a game of it and move the control points all along the bolt. Always move along the clockwise direction. This practice is not just for consistency, it keeps your place and ensures that moving a control point doesn't change a portion of the curve that you've already completed. In time you learn to move the first point only part of the way. Then moving the second brings the curve for the first into correct alignment.

If you have some trouble aligning the curve to the edge of the bolt, consider adding a new point. There are two (at least) ways to accomplish this:
* Select 2 points that surround the problem spot where you want a new vertex and click the Subdivide button on the Curve Tools 1 tool panel.
* If near an end point, Select it, press the '''CKEY''' to open the curve, then '''Control+LMB''' click to add a new point beyond the end of the selected final vertex. Press the '''CKEY''' to reclose the curve.

{{Clear}}


[[Image:blender-2dlogo-polish-position-2.png|frame|right|Adding a new end point]] The new end point should be positioned and then you have to adjust the curve on both sides of the end point you move. Any time you move an end point be sure that the curve going into both adjacent (clockwise and counter-clockwise) end points still aligns with the edge of the bolt.


[[Image:blender-2dlogo-polish-find-defects.png|frame|left|Finding trace defects]] Once you've made the complete circuit around the bolt, you're ready for the final polishing of the edge of the curve. Press the '''TAB''' to switch to the object mode. This makes the polishing easier as Blender hides the points and lines for editing the curve. Now zoom in on the bolt's edge using the '''NUM+''' or '''Control+LMB''' drag. Use '''Shift+MMB''' drag the screen so that you closely observe the entire edge of the bolt while zoomed in closely. Look for places where the curve pulls away from the edge. 

Also look for sharp bends at each of the end points that should be smooth. You can see several defects that I found in my project after tracing the bolt. Switch back into edit mode to fix the curve and then go back into object mode to look for more defects.

[[Image:blender-2dlogo-polish-fix-defects.png|frame|right|Correcting poorly shaped curve]] Sharp end points are adjusted by decreasing the angle between end point and the control points. Many times that is impossible to do, without messing up what you're trying to draw, so the other way is to add more curves by subdividing ( '''WKEY''' -&gt; subdivide )the existing curve between two end points, and playing with the control points to get a nice smooth curve,

Places where the curve pulls away from the edge can be resolved by moving the control point closer to the edge. In the above image the curve was found to have been pulled away from the edge. This was fixed by moving the control point a little to the left.

[[Image:blender-2dlogo-polish-final.png|left|thumb|Final Polished Curve]] Here's the final polished curve for my project. It is shown in both edit mode and object mode so you can clearly see both the control and end points on the left and the curve to the right.

'''Noob note:''' In blender 2.37 and later (not sure of earlier versions) pressing the '''HKEY''' toggles the control points between free and aligned (Edit Mode). Free Control Points are good for sharp angles, and aligned are good for smooth curves. This shortcut is in the '''Space -&gt; Edit -&gt; Control Points''' menu.

This concludes the tracing of the bolt. All that remains is making the curve 3 dimensional, applying a material and positioning the final object. Before doing that, we will trace the circle in the next part of the tutorial. Save this project if you want to take a break before continuing. You'll need it on the next turorial.

{{Clear}}

=== Adding a Third Dimension ===
[[image:Blender3d bezier Curve and surface panel.jpg|right|250px]]
First, give the object some depth. if you are in wirefame, hit '''ZKEY''' to go in to solid mode, then down on the editbuttons screen, locate the  &quot;Curve and Surface&quot; panel, and set the following values: 

* Back and front buttons are selected (depressed), otherwise it will be see through.
* Extrude: 0.2 (the height of the extrusion on either side)
* Bevel Depth: 0.02 (the radius of the round bevel applied to the exruded edge)
* BevResol: 4 (the number of subdivisions on the bevel curve)

'''Noob note:''' In previous versions, Extrude and Bevel Depth were Ext1 and Ext2.)

'''Noob note:''' In versions 2.6x(possibly also 2.5x), go to ''Properties panel --&gt; Object Data --&gt; Geometry'' for these settings.

Now you can use your knowledge from earlier in this book to change the material and/or add texture to your logo.  Feel free to rotate, add lighting, or whatever floats your boat. Don't forget to press '''ZKEY''' to toggle wireframe mode.

{{Clear}}


[[image:Blender3d 2d Logo center 3d lifted.jpg|left|200px]]

You should now have something that looks like the photo on the left.


{{Clear}}

== Modeling the red circle ==

It will be helpful to make the lightning bolt distinct from the circle part of the logo, by applying a yellow material to it before continuing.

Method one is the easiest, so try it that way first.


=== Method 1 - using bezier circle ===

====Outer circle====
[[Image:bezier_circle1.png|right|200px|Bézier Circle]]

Switch to object mode by hitting '''TAB''' if you aren't already there. '''LMB''' somewhere near the center of the background photo. Press '''space -&gt; Add -&gt; Curve -&gt; Bézier Circle''' to add a closed bezier curve with four points forming a circle. If you are in solid draw type, switch to wireframe with '''ZKEY''' so you can see the underlying image better.  Hit '''SKEY''' to scale the bezier circle to fit over the circle in the image.  Again, if you are using one of the newer versions, you will have to switch the circle from '''3D''' to '''2D''' in the object panel.  

'''Noob note:''' You should stay in object mode for now, as it's easier to scale and move the bezier circle without having to keep track of which end points are selected.


{{Clear}}
[[Image:bezier_circle2.png|right|200px|Match up left and right sides]]

You will probably find that the bezier circle is not dead center on the sample logo so you will need to move it with '''GKEY''' to center it.  You may need to scale it and move it several times to get it right.  You will also find that the circle in the sample image is actually a slight oval, so scale and position the bezier circle, along the X axis, and Y axis, so that it touches the circle in the image on the left and right sides.

Normally, you could then scale the circle and constrain it on the X and Y axis by using '''SKEY''', but it turns out that the oval isn't regular anyway, so just select the point on the top and hit GKEY and then '''XKEY''', or '''YKEY''' to move it around until it touches the top of the oval in the image.  Then do the same for the bottom point and you should have a pretty good fit.

====Inner half circle 1====
[[Image:bezier_circle4.png|right|200px|Circle in circle]]
Just to understand what's happening in the next steps, switch to solid view with '''ZKEY'''.  As you can see, you now have a circle, but it's filled in the middle where you want to be able to see through it.  To cut a hole out of the circle, be sure that the circle is selected, then hit '''Shift+S''' -&gt; &quot;cursor to selection, to put the cursor in the middle, switch into '''edit mode''', if you're not already in it, and then '''Space -&gt; Add -&gt; Bézier Circle'''.  A new circle will appear inside the larger circle.  As you can see in solid mode, the new circle actually cuts its shape out of the larger circle surrounding it.

'''Noob note:''' make sure you are in Edit Mode or it will add the new Bézier circle without cutting it out of the existing one.

[[Image:bezier_circle_5.png|right|200px|Place two points at either end of the bar]] 
Switch to wireframe mode with '''ZKEY''' so that you can see the underlying image again.  Scale up the smaller circle so that it approximately fits the inner part of the circle in the image.  Don't worry about getting it exact since you'll be manually moving all four points anyway.  Move the bottom point of the bezier circle to the top left corner of the bar that crosses the circle. 


{{Clear}}
[[Image:bezier_circle_6.png|right|200px|Place two points at either end of the bar]]
Move the right point of the circle to the other corner.  When you create a Bézier Circle, Blender by default sets the alignment of all the control points to aligned.  To make the diagonal bottom edge you need to break the alignment on the two lower sets of control points.  Hitting the '''HKEY''' will toggle between free control points and aligned.  Once you've selected the two lower bezier points and hit the '''HKEY''' to make them free you can move each of the inner control points to create a nice straight edge. Then move the other two points and adjust their control points until you have a pretty good approximation of the rest of the inside curve.

''In Blender 2.63 and others, pressing the H key seems to hide vertices instead. To set control points to free, select the vertice, then in the curve tools under Handles, select Free. (can also be set via the menu at Curve-control points-set handle type-Free)''

====Inner half circle 2====
[[Image:bezier_circle_8.png|right|200px|Wider bevel has a nice look]]
Next step is to press '''space -&gt; Add -&gt; Bézier Circle''' again and repeat the same steps, but for the lower opening in the logo.  Once you've completed both openings, switch back to solid view with '''ZKEY''' and examine your work.  Make any adjustments you need to by switching the draw type back and forth as needed.

====Make it 3d====
[[Image:Blender 3D - Logo circle in 3D - 20100905.jpg|right|200px]]
The next step is to make this part three dimensional like you did with the lightning bolt.  
Go to object mode with '''TAB''', then select the editing buttons.  

Under curve and surface, set:

Extrude/Ext1 to 0.05, 

Bevel Depth/Ext2 to 0.02

BevResol to 4. 


{{Clear}}

[[Image:bezier_circle_10b.png|right|50px|Width adjustment restores to normal size]]
[[Image:bezier_circle_9b.png|right|50px|Bevel has increased logo size]]
Now that we have beveled it there will be a problem. Switch back to wireframe mode with '''ZKEY''' and you'll see that the bevel has widened everything so that the circle no longer matches the original image.  This can be fixed fairly easily by reducing the width parameter under curve and surface to about 0.98. 

'''Noob Note:''' I don't see an easy way to adjust the width parameter under curve and surface in Blender 2.70.  I was, however, able to adjust using '''WKEY''', Width, and then incrementing with the mouse.  


{{Clear}}
[[image:Blender3d Logo combine into one unit.jpg|right|150px]]
For final steps, select the lightning bolt again and switch into sideview with '''NUM3''' and hit '''GKEY''' and then '''ZKEY''' to move both elements up or down until the bolt is inside the circle. 

Apply a red material to the circle and bar portion. Finally, you can go to view, then to background image and hit the background image button to hide the image now that it is no longer needed.  At this point, you can add any finishing touches for lighting and camera angles and render the logo.

After rendering you will have something like this:

===Method 2 - using mesh circle and edges ===

Instead of using the Bézier Curve, you can use Circles.

There are two ways of doing this:

====Easy way====

Place two vertices (CTRL+LMB), one on the inner circle and one on the outer circle so that they form a line. This line has to be perpendicular to the circle you are tracing. Then place the cursor on the middle of the circle. Then just use the spin tool under the Mesh tools tab (360 degrees and 32 steps). This creates a circle made of 32 adjacent squares. Give it more steps to increase the quality of the circle.

====Detailed way====

Go to the top view (NUM7), and press SPACE -&gt; Mesh -&gt; Circle. Accept the 32 vertices, you can make it less but it won't look as good.

Move it into the center of the circle, if you don't then I advise you have wireframe on for the moment (press Z). Then press S, for scale, and make it the correct size for the inside of the circle. Once you have that in the correct place, like so:

[[Image:Johno_logocircle1.jpg|center|200px|Adding the first circle]]

You may need to stretch it sideways a little, then press 'E' to extrude (choose Only Edges), press 'S' to scale and another sized circle will appear, size this appropriately then click LMB.

Deselect the second circle, then select four vertices that are near each other and that form a square. 

[[Image:Johno_logocircle2.jpg|center|200px|Selecting the four vertices]]

Now press F and a face will appear, i.e. the box will be filled (turn off Wireframe, press z). Now do this right around the circle. To do this, hold down Shift and Ctrl, then draw a circle around the two vertices you wish to deselect with the Left Mouse Button. Then draw a circle around the next two vertices while holding down Ctrl and LMB, '''NOT SHIFT'''. Shift changes the control from selecting, to deselecting. 

Once you have gone all around the circle it's time to make the line through the middle.
To make the crossing line you need to move 4 of the vertices slightly; example below:

[[Image:Johno_logocircle3.jpg|center|200px|Moving the four vertices]]

Once you do this, highlight the 4 you moved, then press F.

====Making the circle 3D====

Highlight the full circle by pressing A either once or twice. Go to Side View, and press E for extrude and drag it down so that it is the same thickness as the lightning bolt (you'll see why). 

Now look at what you have made... it looks nice enough but where the lightening bolt goes through the circle it looks a bit odd so we will make it look like the circle is laying on top of the bolt. Where the bolt goes through the circle, note the edges and the vertices. Move them so that the lines are just either side of where the bolt goes through. Then make new edges using CTRL+R on the outsides of these edges. Like so:

[[Image:Johno_logocircle4.jpg|center|200px|Creating the overlap]]

Now you have squares where the lightning bolt hits the circle. Change to Wireframe (z) if you are not already in it then highlight the 16 vertices of these boxes and raise them. Now do the same for where the center line crosses the bolt but create 4 lines instead of two. To explain why, I've created a diagram.

[[Image:Johno_diag_1.jpg|center|200px|Why we use 4 points instead of 2]]

Now we can make the finishing touches, add subsurf and set it to 2 or 3 and add color! Then you are done :-) I won't go over subsurf and adding color because people have covered that better than I could in previous 'Noob to Pro' pages. I think that's everything.

You should now be looking at something similar to:[[Image:Johno_logofinished.jpg|center|200px|The finished article]]

=== Method 3 - using mesh circle and a cube ===

Tracing the '''No symbol''' is somewhat more complex than the lightning bolt. The reason is this symbol is hollow and requires additional planning to trace than just following an outline of an object.

I'll be back to explain the difficulties in the near future, so stay tuned.

One way to do this is outlined below:
* The first thing to do is add a mesh circle. Hit '''SPACE''' and select 'Add -&gt; Mesh -&gt; Circle'. (This circle is mostly for measuring purposes, and will ultimately be removed.)
* Scale ('''SKEY''') and move ('''GKEY''') the circle so that it's sides are even with the sides of the logo circle, and the top and bottom are an even distance from the top and bottom of the logo circle. (The logo circle is not perfectly round.)
[[image:Firstcircle.png]]
* Make sure you're in object mode ('''TAB'''), add a cube ('''SPACE''', 'Add -&gt; Mesh -&gt; Cube') and place it ('''GKEY''') on the right edge of the circle so that it is centered on the right     edge.
* Scale ('''SKEY''') the cube so that it is the same width as the wall of the circle and touching each side of the wall. 
* Now, we want the 3Dcursor at the center of the logo circle. To do this, go back to object mode ('''TAB'''), and select the circle that we added earlier ('''RMB'''), then press '''SHIFT+SKEY''' and choose 'Cursor -&gt; Selection'. (This is the main reason why we have this circle here.)
* Reselect the cube ('''RMB''') and  '''TAB''' to edit mode.
* Choose '''NUM7''' for the top view, and use '''RMB''' to  select only the front face of the cube. (Before this you have to make sure that you are in 'Face select mode'.) 

* Press '''XKEY''' and choose Erase Vertices. This will reduce the cube to a square


* Press '''NUM7''' to go to the top view then select the Editing panel ('''F9''').
* Press '''AKEY''' to select all, and then make sure that the rotate settings are set to degr:360 , Steps:50 , Turns: 1. (Actually, Steps can be whatever number suits your fancy. You may want to play with various values.) This is just like we did for creating the man's hat.
* Click on 'Spin' to extrude the square into a ring. 

Next we will create the bar.  
* Staying in Edit mode, hit '''SPACE''' and select 'Add -&gt; Cube'. If you haven't moved the cursor since the ring extrusion, it should appear in the middle of the ring.
* Expand ('''SKEY''') the cube so that it just encompasses the inside circle of the ring
[[image:CircleSquare2.png]]
* Scale ('''SKEY''') the square in the Y axis ('''YKEY''') so that it is approximately the thickness of the logo bar.
* Return to object mode ('''TAB'''), and rotate ('''RKEY''') the ring together with the just designed bar so that it is parallel to the logo bar.
* In Edit Mode ('''TAB'''), squash the ring in the Y direction ('''SKEY''', '''YKEY''') so that it fits the logo ring.
[[image:RingBar1.png]]
* In edit mode, reselect just the bar.  To do this, choose 'Face select mode', and do an area select of the face selectors near the center of the bar (use the '''BKEY''', or '''SHIFT+RMB''' methods).
* Re-rotate ('''RKEY''') the bar (in Edit Mode) so that it is parallel to, and in the middle of, the logo bar.
[[image:RingBar2.png]]
* The next thing we need to do is scale the bar so that it is precisely the same width as the logo bar.  
* To do this, choose scale ('''SKEY'''), and press '''YKEY''' twice.  This will go to local scale mode (local to the object). This is why we were rotating the entire ring, since the ring and bar are part of the same object.
[[image:RingBar3.png]]
* We no longer need the original circle now, (it should be sticking out from the top and bottom of the ring), so select it ('''RMB'''), and delete it ('''XKEY''').
* If you hit '''NUM3''' You'll see that the bar and the ring are at completely different heights than the lightning bolt.  Select and scale them so that they are all roughly the same height (the bar should be slightly higher than the bolt, and the bolt slightly higher than the ring so that all the proper parts are covered.).
* You can use the trick above to select ('''RMB''') only the bar, scale it in the Z axis ('''SKEY''', '''ZKEY''') and then  hit '''SPACE''' and choose 'Select -&gt; Inverse' to select the ring (all but the bar). 
* When done rescaling, press '''NUM7''' to look at your handiwork.
[[image:RingBar4.png]]
* There is one last bit, which is to slightly rotate the whole ring around the X axis so that it is below the top of the bolt and above the bottom.
* Once that's done, all that's left to do, is color in the ring.

Eeep, this solution is essentially the same as the one found at jeays.net/rubiks, and it gives a second solution, also by David Singmaster.--[[User:64.230.50.205|64.230.50.205]] 01:03, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

'''Don't merge.''' It would only confuse beginners on the subject of how to solve a Rubik's Cube, and they are most likely going to be the most frequest visitors to this page. And it seems that half the people who want to merge the articles aren't giving any reason as to why it would be better, either.

'''Don't merge'''. This article should contain a link at its end to the general NxNxN cube, but these are separate topics that should have seperate entries. [[User:68.162.100.40|68.162.100.40]] 03:59, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

Definitely '''merge'''! -[[User:Mydotnet|Mydotnet]] 02:16, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

'''Merge'''. --[[User:Ryan524|Ryan524]] 02:25, 29 September 2005 (UTC)&lt;BR&gt;

Eh. '''Merge''' it. It makes more sense as an extension of this book anyway. How does one go about merging a book? Do administrators do it, or do authors? -- unknown

My advice. '''Dont merge''' it ''unless by merge you mean append as separate section''.
This solution is 'easy' to follow.
The general solution of nxnxn is harder to follow and even harder for some people to see how to apply it to say a 2x2x2.
The third book missing, (not yet started) is one that details how to solve such puzzles in general using the principles of conjugation... That method solves dodecahedral 'cubes' and a number of other variants that do not fit nxnxn. It solves whole classes of rearrange the bits puzzles where a move always move N pieces. Eg Olympic ring shaped grooves with coloured balls rolling around in them...



In fact it also solves 3x3x3x3 but that gets spooky...
[[User:202.164.205.96|202.164.205.96]] 15:10, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

'''Don't merge'''. This book is a self-proclaimed inefficient but ''intuitive'' introduction to solving the cube for beginners. NxNxN is great for completeness but it is not ''intuitive'' or in any way easy for beginners. Beginners need all the clarity they can get. The fewer new concepts they have to learn the better. Adding NxNxN would create an immediate and unnecessary order of complexity. As a recent beginner I can garauntee you that if this page had been muddled with NxNxN strategies, I wouldn't have read it. 
[[User:Credford|Credford]] 17:59, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

'''Merge!''' It should be used as a reference to other users if they want to find out more about it. [[User:3857wiki|3857wiki]] 20:01, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

'''Don't merge'''. Lots of beginners (incl. me) turn to the 3*3 cube wikibook for simple, specific instructions. Merging will effectively render the 3*3 page useless for beginners, while not making the general solution any more useful for technically accomplished cubers. There's no upside.  A link from the 3*3 solution to to the generalized solution  is in order, but that's all. [[User:207.6.31.6|207.6.31.6]] 21:09, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

Can we reach  a consensus on this? There seems to be no good reason to merge and lots of good reasons not to. Should I remove the merge suggestion from the Rubik's Cube article? [[User:207.6.31.6|207.6.31.6]] 05:49, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

I see your point.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lunakeet]

I say dont merge because it will just really mess up beginners-- nobody you need to know of

'''Don't merge''' This is a specific article on how to solve the 3x3 cube. Also, the other page's instructions are harder to understand.

'''Rewrite the NxNxN article''' Looking at the NXNXN article, it really almost exclusively focuses on 3X3X3 and only mentions 2X2X2 to state the obvious. (e.g. if you can solve a 3X3X3; the same thing works for 2X2X2). It's 3X3X3 method is different than this one so it would be rather difficult to merge that one in here without removing much of this. So I think what should happen is on the NxNxN article should be changed to really become how to solve what the article title says.

== Neglects to mention easiest method of &quot;solving&quot; (which isn't really solving at all)==

i.e removing the stickers and putting them back in the default position. Far easier than all the rubbish mentioned here. --[[User:86.135.217.213|86.135.217.213]] 06:29, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

:This method has been added. [[User:68.52.56.111|68.52.56.111]] 19:52, 21 April 2006 (UTC)

::That isn't solving.  It's cheating.  People who want to know how to solve a Rubik's Cube need not be taught how to peel the stickers off.  Actually, if you practice, it's ten times faster (at least!) to solve it than to peel the stickers off.  Besides, the stickers are nearly impossible to replace without an adhesive.  --[[User:Ravi12346|Ravi12346]] 00:54, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

:What about taking the cube apart instead?  If you're going to cheat, you may as well do it without rendering the cube unusable.  --[[User:Ravi12346|Ravi12346]] 00:55, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

Can't you treat this seriously? Yes, you can take the stickers off and replace them, or disassemble and then reassemble the cube, but these do not constitute solving, and have their associated problems. The stickers are prone to peeling off after extended use; actively peeling them off only accelerates this. Disassembly risks permanent damage if not done properly. - [[Sorceror Nobody]]

==Rotating the center faces==
lol 105 moves.. well it works but there is a much simpler alternative at alchemistmatt's page: http://www.alchemistmatt.com/cube/rubikcenter.html will someone integrate this please. [[User:218.102.220.129|218.102.220.129]] 01:59, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

[[User:879(CoDe)|Nate]] 22:48, 25 August 2006 (UTC)
:Desperately. The Step 3 description is so convoluted that by the end of the first paragraph one has no idea which edges he (or she) is meant to be solving.
:Yes I completely agree with this. As someone who is trying to learn to solve the cube from this article, I can tell you it is extremely unclear on many points. I keep getting bad results and having to start again. I am finding vanderblonk.com significantly more helpful.

== Clean up the description ==

As noted above, Step 3 is VERY difficult to comprehend.  I would recommend rephrasing that section so that it conveys the thought process coherently. [[Special:Contributions/99.225.118.72|99.225.118.72]] ([[User talk:99.225.118.72|talk]]) 19:05, 1 September 2008 (UTC)

== 2 vs. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ==

This page uses &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to denote half turns, but simply 2 is much more common.  Should this be changed?  --[[User:Ravi12346|Ravi12346]] 00:49, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

::I believe it should, if noone complains, I will change it. --[[User:Blonkm|Blonkm]] 17:04, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

How about L&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, meaning ''n'' compositions of the operator L? Makes more sense than ''n''L. --NF July 2007

::Definitely not, this is a very ''mathematical'' way of showing algorithms. The cube may have some mathematical relatedness, but that doesn't make it necessary to make algorithms less readable. The standard notation adopted on the internet is to not use special characters or formatting, so just 2 will suffice. And by the way, it's not ''n''L it's L''n'' --[[User:Blonkm|Blonkm]] ([[User talk:Blonkm|talk]]) 21:23, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

== Copyvio? ==

This page seems to be ripped from the following page: [http://jeays.net/rubiks.htm] (see solution #2). I would recommend a deletion or complete rewrite. [[User:211.72.233.5|211.72.233.5]] 10:09, 8 October 2006 (UTC) ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ultra-Loser Ultra-Loser])

== White-other color? ==
In attempting to learn the method described in this article, I was immediately stumped by the description &quot;white-other color (OC)&quot;. Is this a white piece with a particular color adjacent to it? Can this be clarified in the article?

:I agree with you, this article was clearly not written with clarity in mind, though it is helping me to solve my cube.

:Please someone edit this.  I really have no clue what other-color means.


I agree wholeheartedly. I attempted to learn how to solve the cube with the explanation here and it was written so poorly I couldn't make heads or tails of one line of it. (edit: well i'm pleased to say i figured out how to solve the cube on my own.. and now reading back over this it certainly does make sense. and now i can say with a lot more certainty that it is worded horribly)


== UB'R2D'U'RU2BR'B2L2 is gibberish to a beginner. ==

This page needs to start with a proper explanation of what the letters and numbers mean. A complete beginner (such as myself) has no idea. [[User:Dodger67|Dodger67]] 11:03, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

it does. click on the link under &quot;notation&quot; [[User:Sompm|Sompm]] 02:58, 4 November 2007 (UTC)

== Pictures in notation ==

The picture in the notation section under 'F' doesn't seem right to me.  It looks like the cube's colors have been switched when there's meant to be a face rotation.  Thinking there should be a white bar instead of a yellow one in the pic.  Can anyone fix this?

The picture for 'D' also isn't correct. The green side is supposd to be colored orange. The white tiles in the 'F' picture are supposed to be orange as well. I've tried uploading the necesary files, but can't seem to include them in this page. The correct SVG-Pictures are at [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rubiks_F_1.svg] and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rubiks_D1.svg]

== Notation? ==

Is there any difference between R' and R? Article should mention something about it since the link doesn't

:R´ denotes rotating the right face counterclockwise and R denotes rotating the right face clockwise. The notation is given in the Wikipedia article about the Rubik´s Cube: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube. Erwin

== Step 2 is incomplete ==

In step 2, three possibilities are given: the corner block is in the D layer (with the white face on either D or F/R face) or the corner block is in the correct position in the U layer. It is however also possible that the corner block is in the U layer, but not in the correct position. How should one proceed then? Erwin

::Good point. Usually it is advised to take out the corner using one of the algorithms mentioned (it will push out the corner, since you are inserting another one). Then, again using one of the algorithms mentioned, you can solve the corner. This should be added (though IMHO this whole book needs a rewrite, which I have been pondering but never got to...) --[[User:Blonkm|Blonkm]] ([[User talk:Blonkm|talk]]) 21:26, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

== This book needs to be rewritten ==

I would do it myself, but my English is very poor. I have read it all and a think '''the example solve is full of mistakes and ambiguity''' -- even if it gives a solve after all.

== Step 5: Position corner pieces ==

I'm trying to solve a cube for the first time, and I was doing fine up until this step (the last corners).
It mentions &quot;the last 4 unsolved corners&quot;, but I have 5: the four U (opposite the nearly-solved white side) and the DRB &quot;empty&quot; corner.
And the rest of the step is completely incomprehensible. What, exactly, am I putting DRB and UFL? This needs to be clarified or rewritten.

(update to above) I've figured out Step 5, but it's still badly written.[[Special:Contributions/65.96.201.130|65.96.201.130]] ([[User talk:65.96.201.130|talk]]) 00:53, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

== Why does example solution add unnecessary moves? ==

You could look at is as clearly sub-optimal, or as incorrect use of notation?

R′ B R D2 F2 L U′ F U R′ D R F D F′ F′ D′ F U2 R′ D′ R U2 U′ F′ D′ F U U B′ D′ B U′ y2 F D2 F2 R F R′ B′ D F D′ B D F′ F2 D M D2 M′ D F2 (54moves)

can be written/simplified as

R′ B R D2 F2 L U′ F U R′ D R F D F2 D′ F U2 R′ D′ R U F′ D′ F U2 B′ D′ B U′ y2 F D2 F2 R F R′ B′ D F D′ B D F D M D2 M′ D F2 (50moves)

I would change it but the animation needs changing as well.

== Restructuring Methods/Faster Methods ==

Hi, I am starting to go through this page, hoping to improve it a little. It would seem that the logic between Methods and Faster methods is broken. Apparently, there used to be only one method, the &quot;Beginner CF&quot; method, and the faster method section continues &quot;While the above method may be good for a beginner, ...&quot; Now there are several methods listed under Methods, most actually not for beginners. The content behind those wikibook links is rather uneven. I would be tempted to redo the methods section. Create a section &quot;Beginner Methods&quot;, give the &quot;Beginner CF&quot; method, list perhaps five other relevant examples with external links similar to what is done under &quot;Faster methods&quot;.
Since I am new to this page I didn't just want to go ahead. Depending on the feedback, I'll put a suggestion.
[[User:Randinfogen|Randinfogen]] ([[User talk:Randinfogen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Randinfogen|contribs]]) 18:40, 5 October 2014 (UTC)

Done. We had Methods and Faster Methods. Now there are Methods (shortened to links with actual content), Classical Methods, Beginner Methods, and the original Faster Methods.
[[User:Randinfogen|Randinfogen]] ([[User talk:Randinfogen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Randinfogen|contribs]]) 06:49, 15 October 2014 (UTC)

As already discussed, it would be nice if the example solution is cleaned up. Also, the wikibook Beginner CF might not really be a representative beginner solution, but it is interesting and should be kept (perhaps after cleanup). Does someone have a link to the original source for the Beginner CF? It would be really nice to have more detailed descriptions of other methods, just saying the obvious ...

=== Interdisciplinary Entanglements ===
There is a b[ou]rrowing pattern: &quot;Economic subjectivism&quot;, &quot;Interpretive sociology&quot;, &quot;Social psychology&quot;, &quot;Sociolinguistics&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
The discipline of the [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive sciences] gives greater credence to the individual and detailed study of biology.&lt;br /&gt;
The present field of Communications betrays four factions: Rhetorical Theory, Social theory, Theater and Journalism.&lt;br /&gt;
Theater Arts and Journalism are often distinguished schools.&lt;br /&gt;
The difficult relationship of classical Rhetoric and Sociological interpretation constitute a significant fissure within the Communication discipline.&lt;br /&gt;
The elements of linguistics, philosophy and computer science are prevalent in the Cognitive sciences. Convergence with the field will reinforce the Rhetorical (read: persuasive) nature of Communications. The terminology of rhetoric and the intertextual discourse of rhetorical scholars, quantitative analysts and interpretive researchers has and will continue to increase within the field.

We can always use more real world examples, and more example problems both in the text and in the problems and answer section.  Even a few help, especially if you have access to mathematica and/or maple and can generate them quickly.  I do not and have to solve them by hand, a slow process.

NOTE: Especially need help on the first order linear section.  My calc-fu is not up to doing complex integrals of &lt;math&gt;e^{f(x)}g(x)&lt;/math&gt; by hand.

NOTE: Especially need more real world examples of both homogenous and nonhomogenous constant coefficient problems.

==Checking existing examples==

Since I do them by hand, there are probably some mistakes among the existing examples.  If someone cares to check them and fix any mistakes, it'd be appreciated.

==Graphs==

For the section on graphing-  I don't have any good software for generating graphs.  If anyone can get me some jpegs of slope fields and isoclines, I can write my explanation to work with your jpegs.  Or just write the lesson if you care to.

: I have Mathematica 5.2, I can make some graphs if you give me the equations. Just reply with the equations and I will post them. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:71.107.52.66|71.107.52.66]] ([[User talk:71.107.52.66|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/71.107.52.66|contribs]]) 22:23, 30 December 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

: Just a small note, you'll want to save the graphics as a PNG file. It's a lossless compression format and is best suited for exactly these types of images. I have Mathematica and gnuplot, so I may look into making some graphs. [[User:Robert A. Maxwell|Robert A. Maxwell]] ([[User talk:Robert A. Maxwell|talk]]) 15:00, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

: The [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/ matplotlib] Python module is freely available, similar to, and nearly as good as Matlab if you are familiar with that.

==Write a section==

Feel free to just go ahead and write a section I haven't gotten to yet.  If that would require opening the next chapter that hasn't been broken down yet, I'd be happy to discuss how to do it with you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Development of Home Remedies and Herbalism ==

The use of home remedies throughout history extends from simple food remedies, to more complex herbal preparations. Generally, the home herbal remedies were prepared as a tea to be drunk, or a poultice to be applied externally. Food remedies ranged from having an underlying  complex classification system such as used by the Chinese in Traditional Chinese Medicine, to having a poorly understood but still effective oral tradition. 


A unifying characteristic of these remedies is that they comprised of ingredients that were at least readily available at the time, such as using local herbs that were growing in the area. Indigenous groups, such as the Australian aboriginals and American Indians, made use of native plants to develop remedies that modern herbalists have also begun to explore in their practices. An example of this is the use of an extract of Wild Plum native to Australia to balance blood sugar levels.


The efficacy of some, but not all, traditional herbal home remedies is shown in the development of some modern drugs by the early pharmaceutical industry. For example, opium was developed from opium poppies, aspirin from Willow Bark (which is still used by individuals and herbalists today), the heart drug digitalis from foxglove, and quinine from the cinchona tree.


The body of knowledge that today is known as 'home remedies' and 'herbal medicine' developed along three main avenues, although as I described above, each country has their own oral traditions. Western herbal medicine developed from the early traditions of Greek, Roman and Medieval sources. Ayurveda developed in India, and the Chinese developed Traditional Chinese Medicine (or TCM). These traditions, and in particular the early Western tradition from the time of the Greeks, borrowed ideas and treatments from other traditions, especially the Indian and Oriental sources. This cultural cross-influence often reflected colonization, trade, or other, wider societal developments which facilitated the exchange of ideas. 


In some instances, this cross cultural pollination was developed from learning to survive in adverse conditions. Early settlers in America, such as Samuel Thompson (1769-1843) learned useful remedies from the American Indians, which was synthesized with medical and healing related literature of the day.


All three of these modalities (Ayurvedic, Western and Oriental) at one time included both philosophical and spiritual aspects along with the scientific knowledge that existed within a specific time frame.

Latin is a language,

At least it used to be;

It killed the Ancient Romans,

And now it's killing me.

(Iambic Trimeter)



It killed Julius Caesar

And killed those who learned it.

Bless the dead!

They surely earned it.

I started a new book [[A guide to identifying rocks and minerals]], and can't figure out how to add it to the new books list. '''Pleas Help!!!''' --[[User:Summergirl|summergirl]] ([[User talk:Summergirl|talk]]) 23:53, 18 December 2008 (UTC)

Now that more books are being added can we have maybe a showtime of say two or three weeks instead of a month? - [[User:Serge|Serge]]
:What seems to work is just a certain number of books - 15 fits perfectly on the front page (for me at least, in 1280x800), so maybe the policy should be changed to just be &quot;remove the last book when you add one&quot;? [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 19:14, 16 December 2005 (UTC)
::When the list gets too long, it's not unheard of to remove entries after only 2 weeks. I don't think the &quot;1 month&quot; thing is set in stone, it's just a guideline. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:23, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

I'm new to wikibooks, but isn't this backward?  I mean, in Wikipedia, the way you use a template is by having the &quot;Template:whatever&quot; page to be a certain formatted thing that you want on all the pages marked with the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template.  Then, all the pages marked thus point back to that template and they have that formatted thing embedded in them.  --[[User:Gandalfxviv|Gandalf]] 03:28, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

:It's used in two places in different ways: one has it with full-size font and the other a reduced size. I forget where the two are ([[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:New]]) would tell you), but that's the reason as far as I can tell. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:30, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

I've just created a wikibook [[Metal Gear Series]], which I've just begun writing. How do I add it to the template? [[User:Jagged 85|Jagged 85]] 19:55, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

I too am confused about adding my book to somewhere.  I suspect it is ignorance on my part.  I have created the new book Telescope Making.  I have not been able to add it anywhere.  [[User:vorblesnak|vorblesnak]] 11/03/06

:Seeing as no one else added it. I decided to add [[Telescope Making]]. vorblesnak, all you have to do is click &quot;template&quot; and &quot;edit this page&quot; to edit [[Template:New]]. Just add a link to the new wikibook page, followed by the status complete, and the date the page was created. It seems like everyone is using a bold dot (·), not a period (.), to separate each book. This is what I added: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Telescope Making]] {{stage|100%|2006-11-03}} '''·'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (I'm assumming you're finished so I put 100% complete. Please change it if this is wrong.) Hope this helps! -[[User:Hyad|Hyad]] 09:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

== How do you add a new book to the new Wikibook list? ==

I'm a new user and have recently written a pamphlet that I want to add.  Regarding this, I read the following on the &quot;[[Help:How to start a book]]&quot; page:

&quot;Note: If you are a new user, you cannot place your book on the bookshelf by yourself. Once you add your book to the list new Wikibooks, then someone will put it there for you.&quot;

Fine.  Trouble is, the list of new Wikibooks was locked, at least the one I found on the [[Main Page]].  The same list appeared on [[Template:New]], but it was also locked. Is there another list?  If someone could help me break through the confusion so I can add my book to the list, I would appreciate it!  Thx. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Peterb323|Peterb323]] ([[User talk:Peterb323|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Peterb323|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

:Sorry, for the confusion you are having. I started a discussion here: [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2006/November#System for adding new wikibooks and suggesting hot picks]] about changing the system for adding new Wikibooks (and suggestions for hot picks too). There is really only one list for new book links. The one that appears on the main page is the same as the one in this template. Click &quot;edit this page&quot; on the template page for [[Template:New]] or follow this link: http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Template:New&amp;action=edit. Once you add a link to your book to the template, it will appear on the main page. Note that this isn't some all inclusive new book list, it just a list to show new books that people want to put on the main page. -[[User:Hyad|Hyad]] 04:47, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Issues/suggestions ==

A few issues:
# the ingredients part says baking powder, but the procedure says baking soda. I assume baking soda is meant, since it reacts with the vinegar.
# the ingredients part doesn't mention salt, but the procedure calls for it. I didn't know how much salt, so I just used a pinch.
# the recipe should probably mention that the cake should be allowed to cool before being removed from its pan, otherwise it will crumble.
# this could be my personal taste, but I think the tofu mousse is pretty bland... I think adding some sugar would help.

Otherwise, this is a nice recipe and I will probably use it again in the future! Thanks! -[[User:Kotra|Kotra]] ([[User talk:Kotra|talk]]) 21:46, 21 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

As we saw in a previous example, sometimes even though an equation isn't separable in its original form, it can be factored into a form where it is.  Another way you can turn non-separable equations into separable ones is to use &lt;b&gt;substitution methods&lt;/b&gt;.

== General substitution procedure ==

All substitution methods use the same general procedure:

#Take a term of the equation and replace it with a variable ''v''. The key is that the new variable must cover ''all'' instances of the variable ''y''. Otherwise substitution would not help.
#Solve for &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. To do this, take the equation &lt;math&gt;v=f(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the term you replaced and take its derivative.&lt;br&gt;
#Plug in &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; and solve for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.
#Plug &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; into the original term replaced, and solve for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

== Constant coefficient substitution ==

Lets say we have an equation with a term ''ay+bx+c'', such as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=G(ay+bx+c).&lt;/math&gt;

where G is a function. This is non-separable.  But we can sometimes solve these equations by turning the term into a function ''v'', defining ''v''(''x,y'') and finding ''v''&amp;#39;(''x,y,y''&amp;#39;).

:&lt;math&gt;v(x,y)=ay+bx+c \,&lt;/math&gt;

The trick with the derivation of v is that y is also a function of x. The derivative of v thus becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=a\frac{dy}{dx}+b&lt;/math&gt;

In maxima this looks like so:

:(%i1) v:a*y(x)+b*x+c;
and
:(%i2) diff(v,x);
yielding
:(%o1) a*(dy/dx)+b

Next, we rearrange terms and solve for ''y''&amp;#39;(''x,v,v''&amp;#39;):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\frac{dv}{dx}-b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

Now plug v back into the original equation, &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=G(ay+bx+c)&lt;/math&gt;, and get it into the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=f(v)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{dv}{dx}-b}{a}=G(v)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=aG(v)+b&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for v, that is integrate on both sides:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=aG(v)+b&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{aG(v)+b}= dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dv}{aG(v)+b}= \int dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dv}{aG(v)+b}= x+D&lt;/math&gt;

Once you have v(x), plug back into the definition of v(x) to get y(x).

:&lt;math&gt;y(x)=\frac{v(x)-c-bx}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

It is highly suggested that one should not memorize this equation, and instead remember the method of solving the problem.  The final equation is rather obscure and easy to forget, but if one knows the method, he/she can always solve it.  It will also help if one uses other substitution methods.

=== Example 1 ===

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=(x+y+3)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Lets replace the quantity being raised to a power with ''v''.

:&lt;math&gt;v=x+y+3 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now lets find ''v''&amp;#39;.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=\frac{dy}{dx}+1&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for ''y''&amp;#39;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dv}{dx}-1&lt;/math&gt;

Plug in for ''y'' and ''y''&amp;#39;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}-1=v^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=v^2+1&lt;/math&gt;

Now we solve for ''v'', using the methods we learned in [[Differential_Equations/Separable 1|Separable Variables]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{v^2+1}=dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dv}{v^2+1}=\int dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan^{-1}(v)=x+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=\tan(x+C) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now that we have ''v''(''x''), plug back in and find ''y''(''x'').

:&lt;math&gt;y+x+3=\tan(x+C) \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=\tan(x+C)-x-3 \,&lt;/math&gt;

== Other methods ==

These are not the only possible substitution methods, just some of the more common ones.  Substitution methods are a general way to simplify complex differential equations.  If you ever come up with a differential equation you can't solve, you can sometimes crack it by finding a substitution and plugging in.  Just look for something that simplifies the equation.  Remember that between ''v'' and ''v''&amp;#39; you must eliminate the ''y'' in the equation.

=== Example 2 ===

:&lt;math&gt;2y\frac{dy}{dx}=y^2+x-1&lt;/math&gt;

This equation isn't separable, and none of the methods we previously used will quite work.  Let's use a custom substitution of ''v=y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''-1.  Solve for ''v''&amp;#39;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}=2y\frac{dy}{dx}+1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2y\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dv}{dx}-1&lt;/math&gt;

Plug into the original equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dx}-1=v&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for ''v''

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{v+1}=dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dv}{v+1}=\int dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ln(v+1)=x+C \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=Ce^x-1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Now plug in and get ''y''

:&lt;math&gt;Ce^x-1=y^2+x-1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y^2=Ce^x-x \,&lt;/math&gt;


Pretty easy after using that substitution.  Keep this method in mind, you will use this for more complex equations.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Lemontea. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Lemontea~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

The mambots are small scripts that does stuff to the content of mambo. This can be all content - components, mambo content and all other content of the site.

There are many forms of mambots. The most frequent ones are content mambots. These are used like this: you insert {mambot_name} into some content, and the mambot replaces this tag with the functions of the mambot. This can be embeding flash, linking to other content, inserting images etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== I am a computer professional ==
I arrived here July 8 because it was suggested that what I was trying to contribute to Wikipedia more correctly belonged here, so now I am looking here to find out about here.

Here's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AlMac my page on Wikipedia].

Here's one of the articles I am working on there, which some people tell me perhaps ought to be moved to Wikibooks.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Security_Audits Computer security audit] 

Before starting this article, I had studied another one already on Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditing_information_security Auditing IT security] and concluded that the earlier article applied to captains of industry that could afford comprehensive intensive computer audits, from the top down, while what I wanted to describe was the process by which most anyone can afford to do a computer security audit process to improve the security of any system, from the bottom up, gaining education in improving security.

I had started this article, because it is a main section of my earlier effort to address [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_breaches Security breaches], which have been much in the news this year.  I was told that my earlier work did not have a neutral point of view, and while I was trying to fix that, found that my language lost its boldness, so that's one reason I started the audits article, one of a series of definitional articles that I had intended to show that if a computer user is engaged in this or that process, the risk of security breaches is dramatically reduced.

I arrived at Wikipedia approx June 27 because some material I was posting to [http://wiki.midrange.com/index.php/General_Computer_Security Midrange Wiki] was deemed inappropriate for that location.  The reason is that the IBM midrange computer system is one of the most secure in the world, in which most security problems are because we need to interconnect different kinds of computers, including many that are less secure.  My content that was inappropriate for there was that which was about computer security in general, not IBM in specific.

Basically I have been working in computers for over 40 years, and in computer security for at least half that time.  I feel that collectively we have been going backwards in the science of implementing computer security as technology marches forwards.

* So I had gone to Midrange Wiki and started to enthusiastically participate, only to learn, that much of my content was inappropriate to that site because of content outside of the IBM platform.  I figure I had contributed several months worth of stuff there, and had barely begun, when I learned this.  I plan to return an post lots more there, that is directly on point IBM platform, but first I want to get my computer security efforts migrated to wherever they are welcome.

* Then I moved to Wikipedia and have contributed to many articles, with over a week of effort, in intermittent bursts, trying to share my computer know-how, again to learn that perhaps that is not the right place for this.  The article subject is perhaps appropriate for there, but my viewpoint perhaps would blend in better some place else.   I am not ready to give up on Wikipedia.  I may end up posting some articles there, and some here, as I get a better understanding of what belongs in the different places.
[[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 8 July 2005 19:27 (UTC)

:Come unto me all that trauell, and bee heauy laden, and I shall refreshs you. So God loued the worlde that he gaue his onely begotten sonne, to the ende that al that beleue in hym, shoulde not perishe, but haue lyfe euerlasting.

Heare also what saint Paul sayeth.
:This is a true saying, and woorthie of all men to bee receiued, that Jesus Christe came into thys worlde to saue sinners.

Heare also what saint John sayeth.
:If any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propiciacion for our sinnes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:These words have become a very important part of Anglican tradition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Brief Description==

A table saw consists of an electric motor, mounted below a table, which drives a circular saw blade projecting through an opening in the table's surface. The blade rotates toward the front of the table; the operator pushes the work into the blade, against the direction of rotation.

The two primary table saw operations are '''ripping''', in which a board is reduced in width (cutting along the grain) while being pushed along a fence which is parallel to the blade and fixed at a distance from the blade equal to the desired width, and '''crosscutting''', in which the board is reduced in length (cutting across the grain) while being carried through the blade by a mitre gauge, which holds the board perpendicular to the blade while sliding along a groove in the table's surface parallel to the blade (known as a mitre slot).

There are many variants of these operations. The motor may be pivoted laterally so that the blade forms an angle other than 90º to the table's surface, permitting beveled rips and crosscuts. The mitre gauge may be adjusted to form an angle other than 90º to the mitre slot and saw blade, thereby allowing mitres to be cut. And a series of adjacent, parallel cuts can be made with the blade's height set lower than the thickness of the work to create dados and rabbets; these can also be cut using a stack of blades known as a dado set.

==Types of Table Saws==

Table saws can be divided into several categories. The '''bench''' or '''bench-top saw''', also known as a portable or jobsite saw, is compact and lightweight; its durability and accuracy suffer as a result, but it still represents a considerable improvement over a circular saw with a rip guide for production work in the field.

The '''contractor's saw''' is a substantial tool, offering a cast-iron table, typically with a pair of stamped steel extension wings, a 1 1/2 horsepower motor, and a reasonably reliable fence and mitre gauge. The '''hybrid saw''' improves on the contractor's saw with cast-iron extensions in place of the stamped steel, a more powerful motor, and a longer fence adjustable to finer tolerances.

Finally, the '''cabinet saw''', so named because of its enclosed base, features massively rugged construction throughout, from the trunnions supporting the motor, to the handwheels that adjust the height and tilt of the blade, to the rails the fence clamps to. This saw is typically powered by a 3 or 5 horsepower motor, is often accompanied by an extended table and fence/rail system for ripping wide panels, or a sliding-table attachment for crosscutting large pieces, and may weigh in at 500 pounds or more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This wikibook was started in 6 July 2005, pretending to be a comprehensive grammar of Portuguese language for foreign people, a reference for advanced and even basic learners.

It is divided in two main parts. The first part, [[Portuguese Grammar/Alphabet &amp; Phonology|Alphabet &amp; Phonology]] and [[Portuguese Grammar/Basic grammar|Basic grammar]] intends to provide an objective text about standart Portuguese. The second part, [[Portuguese Grammar/Advanced grammar|Advanced grammar]], [[Portuguese Grammar/More on History|More on History]] contains information on the usage of the language, and some pecularities of Portuguese. [[Portuguese Grammar/Variations|Variations]], finally, redisscuss all the book under the perspective of the regional speakings.

This wikibook is strongly based in the Brazilian ''Gramática Normativa da Língua Portuguesa'' by Prof. [[w:Carlos Henrique da Rocha Lima|Carlos Henrique da Rocha Lima]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Última flor do Lácio'': that is how the [[w:Brazil|Brazilian]] poet [[w:Olavo Bilac|Olavo Bilac]] described Portuguese in his [[Portuguese Grammar|famous poem]]: the last flower from [[w:Latium|Latium]], it is one of the latest languages [[w:Romance languages|derivated]] from [[w:Latin|Latin]]. The first documents in Portuguese appear in the thirteenth century.

Initially it was a variety of [[w:Galician|Galician]], but Portugal developed fast and Portuguese became a national language and after an Imperial language: Portuguese ships lead the great Discoveries and spread their language all over the world.

The written language kept strongly its resemblance with other romance languages, specially [[w:Spanish|Spanish]], which is not so far to be mutually comprehensible.

Today, Portuguese is spoken in [[w:Angola|Angola]], [[w:Brazil|Brazil]], [[w:Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[w:East Timor|East Timor]], [[w:Guinea Bissau|Guinea Bissau]], [[w:Macau|Macau]] ([[w:China|China]]), [[w:Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[w:Portugal|Portugal]], and [[w:São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé and Príncipe]] by more than 200 million native speakers, being the fifth or sixth most-spoken first language in the world. Portuguese also developed into several varieties of [[w:Portuguese Creole|Creole]] in Africa. The main varieties of Portuguese are the Brazilian and the European Portuguese. The Portuguese spoken in the ex-collonies in Africa is more similar to the European variety. The differences between these varieties are mainly phonetic, but there are some ortographic disparities. Lexical is similar in formal language, but the familiar language are very enriched in the ex-colonies, by american indians in Brazil or by African black people.

Some remarkable literary works are the epic poem [[w:The Lusiad|The Lusiad]], written by [[w:Luís de Camões|Luís de Camões]] in 1572, which marks the change point from archaic to modern Portuguese. The poem tells the period of the [[w:Portugal in the period of discoveries|Great Discoveries]], specially the journey of [[w:Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]], the first European to reach India by sea.

Modern literature in Portuguese is very productive. Important writers include Portuguese novelist such as [[w:Eça de Queirós|Eça de Queirós]] and [[w:José Saramago|José Saramago]], Brazilian novelists, [[w:Machado de Assis|Machado de Assis]], [[w:Jorge Amado|Jorge Amado]], [[w:Érico Veríssimo|Érico Veríssimo]], and [[w:Luís Fernando Veríssimo|Luís Fernando Veríssimo]], the Angolan novelist [[w:Pepetela|Pepetela]], the Mozambican novelist  Brazilian poets like [[w:Olavo Bilac|Olavo Bilac]], [[w:Carlos Drummond de Andrade|Carlos Drummond de Andrade]] Portuguese poets [[w:Fernando Pessoa|Fernando Pessoa]].

Did I misread the description? Is this recipe's presence in _canada_ because of the influx of loyalists? I changed it to read that the presence in the southern states was because of loyalists, but reading it again, this seems wrong. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt;
: It's in Canada because the Loyalists fled the wrath of the Revolutionaries, they came to Canada because Quebec didn't revolt.  So it came from Southern Loyalists, as the tale goes, and became part of the Ontario culinary palette.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] ([[User talk:Nmontague|talk]]) 11:30, 31 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Paleolithic Art ==


Art has been part of human culture for millennia. Our ancestors left behind paintings and sculptures of delicate beauty and expressive strength. The earliest finds date from the Middle Paleolithic period (between 200,000 and 40,000 years ago), although the origins of art may be older still, lost to the impermanence of materials.

=== Paleolithic Cave Paintings ===

Famous examples of Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) art can be found in France at the caves of Lascaux and Chauvet. Art from this era is also found in regions around the world, including South Africa, where finds at Blombos Cave include an engraved piece of ochre believed to be about 70,000 years old.

In terms of speculating about the consciousness of these artists, it is particularly worth noting that at Lascaux, in what was originally called the Cave of the Dead Man, we could a semiotic effort to talk about the human soul. The &quot;reality&quot; of the representation of all animal figures is very high grade. The one human figure in the cave is done as a stick figure. In the foreground stands a staff surmounted by a bird figure.

{{NOTE|This theme of staff/bird, serpent/bird is found in many cultures, and is noted as part of the language on spirituality in Matthew 10:16, and later by Rumi.

The term &quot;serpent wisdom&quot; continues to live on in numerous places, from discussions of Mayan calendars and the meaning of the so-called Templar mysteries, to a Louisville USA world music dance band. Yet clearly the concept can be seen as part of what we can recognise as human consciousness over 20,000 years ago. [[w:Joseph Campbell|Joseph Campbell]] identifies this figure as the &quot;first hero.&quot;}}

=== Paleolithic Venus Figurines ===

[[Image:VenusWillendorf.jpg|thumb|''The Venus of Willendorf.'']]
Small figurines dating from the Upper Paleolithic period (from about 40,000 to about 10,000 years ago) have been found throughout Europe. They are referred to as &quot;Venuses&quot;, because they usually depict women, often with exaggerated hips and breasts.  Some experts believe these figures could be fertility totems and among the first physical representations of  a religious or superstitious system.  The objects are also sized to be carried easily from place to place as tribes migrated.

The Venus of Willendorf, which was discovered in Austria, is one of the best-known of the Venuses. Carved from limestone, it is estimated to be around 25,000 years old.

Another well-known Paleolithic Venus, &quot;The Black Venus of Dolní Věstonice&quot;, was found in the Czech Republic. It is remarkable in that it (together with other objects found nearby) is the earliest known ceramic work of art so far discovered.

== Mesolithic Art ==

The Mesolithic, or &quot;Middle Stone Age&quot; Period lasted from about 10,000 years ago to the onset of farming in many areas which ranged from about 8,000 - 4,000 years ago. The production of small, portable works of art such as the Venus figurines popular during the Paleolithic era seems to have been greatly reduced.

Rock painting continued into the Mesolithic era, and included highly stylized depictions of human beings. Sites where Mesolithic art has been found include Kamennaya Mogila in the Ukraine, where rather primitive depictions of animals were carved into sandstone, Gobustan in Azerbaizhan and the Zaraut-Kamar grotto in Uzbekistan, both of which include stylized paintings of humans.

'''Chemical equilibrium''' occurs when a '''reversible reaction''' is occurring backwards and forwards at the same time by the same amount.  It is the balancing point of a chemical reaction, when it seems to stop happening.  Although some reactions (like the combustion of propane) occur to completion (no backwards reaction), most reactions occur in both the forward and backward direction.  One reaction will occur at a faster rate than the other, causing a net result.  As the reaction progresses, the forward reaction slows down and the backward reaction speeds up.  When the rates are equal, '''equilibrium''' has occurred.  The reaction appears to have stopped, and the total amount of products and reactants remains stable.

{{Info|Chemical reactions never really stop, but they no longer make any progress once the forwards and backwards reactions are occurring at the same rate.  This is ''equilibrium''.}}

== The Equilibrium Constant ==

The ratio of products to reactants, or &lt;math&gt;K_{eq}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the '''equilibrium constant'''. For the generic reaction mA + nB → xC + yD, the equilibrium constant is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \frac{[C]^x[D]^y}{[A]^m[B]^n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where [X] detonates the '''activity''' of X. The activity of X is:
*its concentration if X is a gas or in a solution
*1 if X is a pure solid or pure liquid

In other words, pure solids and liquids don't affect the equilibrium constant, as long as there is enough for the reaction to proceed.  Their activity is 1, so they don't need to be written in the equilibrium constant.

=== K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; ===

There are two types of &lt;math&gt;K_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;.  One is &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;, and the activities are ''concentrations''.  You are already familiar with this expression; it is the normally-used &lt;math&gt;K_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;.  For gaseous reactions, you may use the concentration equilibrium.  You may also use ''partial pressures'' instead of concentrations.  This expression is denoted &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt;.  The activities are partial pressures instead of concentrations.  This can only be used when all products and reactants are in the gaseous phase.

To convert between &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_c&lt;/math&gt;, there is an equation:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_p = K_c (RT)^{\Delta n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

R is the Universal Gas Constant and T is the temperature at which the reaction is occurring.  &lt;math&gt;\Delta n&lt;/math&gt; is the change (in moles) of gas molecules between products and reactants.  It may be zero (in which case K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Examples===

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 1
15.0 moles of X and 20.0 moles of Y are put into an empty 2.0 liter container. They react, and eventually reach equilibrium with 7.0 moles of Z according to the hypothetical equation:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{X} + 2\hbox{Y} \to \hbox{Z}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Calculate the equilibrium constant.}}

Solution: Because the container was originally empty and at equilibrium, all 7.0 moles of Z are produced by the reaction.  Therefore, 7.0 moles of X and 14.0 moles of Y are consumed in the reaction, so at equilibrium there remain 8.0 moles of X, 6.0 moles of Y, and 7.0 moles of Z.  Divide these values by 2.0 liters to determine the concentration, then substitute into the equilibrium expression:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \frac{[Z]}{[X][Y]^2} = \frac{[3.5]}{[4.0][3.0]^2} = 0.097&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

{{TextBox|1=
;Example 2
5.00 moles of hydrogen are put into an empty 1.00-L container with 5.00 moles of iodine, where they react according to this equation:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2 + \hbox{I}_2 \to 2\hbox{HI}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The equilibrium constant is 51.5 at the temperature of the reaction. Calculate the number of moles of HI that will form.}}

Solution: Suppose 2''y'' moles of HI forms. Then, ''y'' moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are consumed.  Therefore, at equilibrium, there are 2''y'' moles of HI, and (5.00 - ''y'') moles of both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Dividing by 1.00 liters (to find concentration) and writing an equilibrium expression gives:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;51.5 = \frac{[2y]^2}{[5.00-y][5.00-y]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Solving this equation gives y = 3.91 (reject the other solution, as it is greater than 5.00).  At equilibrium, there are 7.82 mol of HI.

== Calculations With K ==

The exact value of K doesn't really matter.  What is important is its ''magnitude''.

{|
 | &lt;b&gt;K &gt; 1&lt;/b&gt;
 | Reactions favors products
 |-
 | &lt;b&gt;K &lt; 1 &lt;/b&gt;
 | Reaction favors reactants
 |}

If the reaction favors products, it will occur in the forward (left-to-right) direction.  If K is very large, the reaction will occur mostly to completion, using up almost all the reactants.

If the reaction favors reactants, it will occur in the reverse (right-to-left) direction.  If K is very small, the reaction will use up almost all the products and make them into reactants.  The reverse reaction is favored.

=== Reaction Arithmetic ===

If you reverse the reaction (changing the direction of the arrow, or flipping the left and right sides), the new value of K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; will be its reciprocal.
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;border:1px&quot;
| A → B || (K = x)
|-
| B → A || (K = 1/x)
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

If you add two reactions, their equilibrium constants are multiplied.
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1px&quot;
|A → B &lt;br&gt; G → H || (K = x) &lt;br&gt; (K = y)
|-
|A + G → B + H || (K = xy)
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

These basic principles can help you determine an unknown equilibrium constant by combining known constants.

=== Q ===

K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is only used when a reaction is in equilibrium.  To find it, write its concentration (or partial pressure) expression, then plug in all the measured values.  The resulting K can be used to predict other equilibrium positions.

If a reaction is not at equilibrium, you can still plug in the measured concentrations.  Instead of calling this value K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;, it is called Q.

{|
 | &lt;b&gt; Q &gt; K &lt;/b&gt;
 | The products must decrease and the reactants will increase.
 |-
 | &lt;b&gt; Q = K &lt;/b&gt;
 | There is equilibrium.
 |-
 | &lt;b&gt; Q &lt; K &lt;/b&gt;
 | The reactants must decrease and the products will increase.
 |}

So, if you know the equilibrium constant for a reaction, and you know all the concentrations, you can predict what direction the reaction will proceed.

=== I-C-E Charts ===

Let's say you know K for a reaction, and you know some concentrations.  You can calculate the final (equilibrium) concentrations using an &quot;Initial-Change-Equilibrium&quot; chart.  Here is an example.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{CO}_{(g)} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(g)} \to \hbox{CO}_{2(g)} + \hbox{H}_{2(g)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

At 25°C, K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 23.2 for this reaction.

First, write the equilibrium expression:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_c = \frac{[H_2][CO_2]}{[CO][H_2O]}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In a sealed container of 2.00 L: 3 molar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, 4 molar CO, 1 molar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been added.  (Write the ICE chart):

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1px&quot;
! 
! CO
! H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
! CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
! H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Initial
| 2
| 1.5
| 0
| 0.5
|-
| Change
| -x
| -x
| +x
| +x
|-
| Equilibrium
| 2-x
| 1.5-x
| x
| 0.5+x
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Now, plug in the &quot;equilibrium&quot; values into the K expression.  Substitute all known values and solve for x.  Then, substitute x for the final values to determine the equilibrium concentrations.

By substituting everything into the K expression, we have:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 23.3 = \frac{(0.5+x) \times (x)}{(2-x) \times (1.5-x)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Solving this will require the use of the quadratic equation.  It may be easier to use approximations or a graphing calculator.  When solved, &lt;math&gt;x = 1.34&lt;/math&gt; (disregard values of x that would give negative concentrations).  By substituting x into the &quot;equilibrium&quot; values in the ICE chart, we can determine the concentrations of all substances when the reaction reaches equilibrium.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=1px
 !CO
 !H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
 !CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 !H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 |-
 |0.66 M
 |0.16 M
 |1.34 M
 |1.84 M
 |}
&lt;/center&gt;

To check your answer, you could substitute these values into the equilibrium expression and see if it equals 23.3 (the given K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; value).

{{Info|This was a fairly simple example.  There were no coefficients in the reaction, so no exponents in the expression.}}

The purpose of doing this is to see the final concentrations of the substances involved in a chemical reaction.  Unless K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is incredibly large, not all the reactants will be consumed.

== Equilibrium in Detail ==

The next few chapters in this book will provide more details on equilibrium.

===Shifts in Equilibrium===
'''Le Chatelier's principle''' states that a system will adapt to minimize a change.  If reactants are added, they will be consumed and products will form.  Likewise, if products are added, they will be consumed (by the reverse reaction) and reactants will form.  

The only change in a system that will affect the value of K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is temperature.  The value of K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is never changed by the concentrations or pressures of the substances.

===Special Constants===
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;K_a = \frac{[H^+] [A^-]}{[HA]}&lt;/math&gt;
| Acids and bases have special '''ionization constants''', which show how they react with water. The acid ionization constant, or K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, tells how strong an acid is.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;K_b = \frac{[\mbox{OH}^-][\mbox{BH}]} {[\mbox{B}]}&lt;/math&gt;
| The base ionization constant, K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, similarly tells how strong a base is.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;K_{sp} = \frac{[A^+] [B^-]}{[AB]}&lt;/math&gt;
| The '''solubility product''' K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; shows how much an ionic substance will dissociate when dissolved.
|}
===Relation to E===
There is a special relation between the standard potential of a redox reaction and the equilibrium constant
&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{0.0592 \log K}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, where n is the number of moles of electrons transferred.
This is a significant equation, because this allows us to calculate the hard to measure K from the easy to measure E.

*2 1/2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1 to 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]]
*3/4 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 1/4 cups yellow or white [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|corn meal]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*2 to 3 tablespoons melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Lard|pan drippings]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or buttermilk.

==Procedure==
#Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C)
#Grease the skillet with bacon drippings (ideal) or oil. Butter isn't recommended, since it can burn when you preheat the skillet.
#Preheat the skillet until the drippings/oil is smoking. This ensures a good crust on the bottom of the cornbread.
#In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.  Thoroughly mix the sifted ingredients together and add the corn meal.
#In a second bowl, beat the egg well.  Add the melted butter (or pan drippings) and the milk and continue to beat until well mixed.
#Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix using fast strokes.  Take care not to overmix.
#Pour the batter into the skillet and place in the oven.  Bake for 25-30 minutes.  The cornbread should have a golden brown color when done, and a knitting needle or knife-point will come out &quot;dry&quot; when inserted in the bread.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Ideally, all ingredients should be at room temperature (about 75°F (24°C)) for this recipe.  However, a good result can still be had if this is not the case.
*Yellow corn meal is preferable to white corn meal, but this can vary according to locality and personal taste.
*Optionally, 1/4 to 1/2 cup of diced cooked ham or crumbled bacon can be added to the batter before pouring into the skillet.  This may add a few minutes to the baking time.

==Warnings==
*The skillet must be oven-safe. Ideally, skillet cornbread should be baked in a cast-iron skillet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vietnamese is a tonal language, i.e. the meaning of each word depends on the &quot;tone&quot; in which it is pronounced. Many other languages also use tones, like Chinese.

There are six distinct tones; the first one (&quot;level tone&quot;) is not marked, and the other five are indicated by diacritics applied to the main vowel of the syllable:

&lt;table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4&gt;
&lt;tr bgcolor=&quot;#eecc00&quot;&gt;&lt;th&gt;Tone&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Marking&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th colspan=12&gt;Marked vowels&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ngang (Level)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Unmarked&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The lowercase letter &quot;i&quot; should retain its dot even when accented. (However, this detail is often lost in computers and on the Internet, due to the obscurity of Vietnamese specialty fonts and limitations of encoding systems.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Throughout this text a consistent notation is maintained, which is essentially that promoted by Kane (and presented to the author with modification by Anderson).  This notation eliminates the ambiguity associated with the multiple [[Multibody Mechanics/Reference Frame|reference frames]] inherent in multibody analysis.  It has been the author's experience in industry that too many problems are brought on by poor notation, and the notion that for some topics this notation is to rigorous has been dismissed.

Scalar quantities are represented by numbers, letters and/or symbols. The following are all scalars:
    x, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, X, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, 3, and 5.5.

Arbitrary vectors are denoted with over-arrows as
    &lt;math&gt;\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vec{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vec{X}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vec{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;.

and unit vectors are given the usual hat notation
    &lt;math&gt;\hat{i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{e}_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Multibody Mechanics/Reference Frame|Reference frames]] are labeled with a single capital letter, with 'N' being reserved for the [[Multibody Mechanics/Inertial Frame|inertial frames]]  (also called the 'Newtonian' frame).

Each [[Multibody Mechanics/Reference Frame|reference frame]] is assumed to have a set of right handed [[Multibody Mechanics/Basis Vectors|basis vectors]] labeled with the same lowercase letter.  Basis vectors for the frame 'B' would be:
    &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}_3&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}_1 \times \hat{b}_2 = \hat{b}_3&lt;/math&gt;.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.4x}}

This page is an update of a great tutorial originally built for blender 2.44.

Blender is not just useful to create complete animations, but it's also a great modeller. You can build your complete 3D scene in Blender, and then export it to a useful format. In fact, you can use it for much more, for example I was using it as a level editor for a freeware 2D game someone else made. There was a short deadline for the game to be finished, and 2 weeks before that deadline, there still was no level editor for it. It had a custom ASCII level format, consisting of lists of materials, vertices, triangles and objects. So, remembering the Blender Python exporters, I volunteered to write an export script for Blender, so it could be used as level editor. And it worked out very well, Blender can be completely used as level editor for that game now.

In this tutorial we'll learn how to write a simple Python export script for Blender. Without requiring previous Python knowledge, it will explain how to query the objects in your scene, and how to write them to a file. It will also demonstrate the usefulness of export scripts, by showing how you can process the data while exporting, so you can achieve things that would not work by using any other existing format.

So, open Blender, make sure the default scene is loaded, and let's begin..

== Finding out about things in a scene ==

[[Image:Blender259 EditorSelector.jpg|203px|right|Blender259 EditorSelector]]

Before we can export something, we must know what to export. One way to get this information is the Outliner window ('''SHIFT-F9'''). It will list all the things currently known to Blender. Now, we want the same information from a script. Click the editor selection button and from the popup menu choose '''Python Console'''.

Now, you are ready for the big moment, you are about to execute the first Blender scripting command. Type this and hit '''RETURN''' (or you could type into the scripts window import Blender on the topmost line, then these lines below it, precede all the 'dir(x)' lines with print and choose file-&gt;Execute):

 list(bpy.data.objects)

As a result, you should see this:

 [bpy.data.objects[&quot;Camera&quot;], bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;], bpy.data.objects[&quot;Lamp&quot;]]

Now, what just happened? The variable given to &quot;list&quot; in &quot;list(bpy.data.objects)&quot; consists of three words, separated by two dots. The dots separate different things. The first, ''bpy'', means to use a function from the bpy module. ''data'' is a sub-module of Blender. And finally objects is an iterator of ''bpy.data.'' The ''list()''  function is used to loop through all data in ''bpy.data.objects'' and return that as a list of all available objects. In our case, this is a Camera, a Cube, and a Lamp.

To get more information about an object, you can use the object name as a key in bpy.data.objects, and assign it to a variable, like this:

 camera = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Camera&quot;]
 cube = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Cube&quot;]
 lamp = bpy.data.objects[&quot;Lamp&quot;]

We just assigned the three objects to three variables, camera, cube and lamp. To see the contents of a variable, type just its name:

 cube 
 bpy.data.objects['Cube']

 camera 
 bpy.data.objects['Camera']

 lamp 
 bpy.data.objects['Lamp']

Sometimes it's useful to use Python's dir() function to get more information about an object. For example

 dir(cube)

will write the names of all functions and properties of the object. Quite a lot. But don't worry, soon you will know how to use all of them. You also may want to find out the type of something, which you can do like this:

 type(cube)

In this case, just typing &quot;cube&quot; already displays the type, but from within an actual script, you would use type(). Something else which can be useful is viewing the documentation of Python objects. To do so, use the help() function on a variable or object.

 help(bpy.data.objects)

This will print the documentation of the bpy.data.objects function we used. Of course, an easier way to view the documentation is the online HTML help. Click on '''Help-&gt;Python API Reference'''. Hopefully now your browser opens and displays the online documentation of the Blender Python API. If not, you should find it also here:

http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_59_2/

In the documentation, click on bpy, then on data and you can see more examples. Using the documentation will get absolutely vital whenever you need to do something in a script not covered in a tutorial. And you will need to do so, else you wouldn't want to learn scripting at all.

Another resource you will need, depending on how far you will go with scripting, is the Python reference:

http://docs.python.org/

For this tutorial, maybe read the &quot;Tutorial&quot; section in the python docs, but you will understand everything without doing so.

Now, let's try to find out more about our cube. Type:

 cube.type

It will tell us that the cube really is a Mesh object in Blender. Look up &quot;type&quot; in the online docs. Since the variable cube holds an Object, and &quot;type&quot; is an attribute of that Object, click on Object. There you find its &quot;type&quot;.

Now that we know that the cube is a mesh, let's find out more about the mesh.

 cubedata = bpy.data[&quot;Cube&quot;]

'Note: in Blender 2.6.0 the script command actually looks like this, but the above is still valid: (Chronus001)

'Note: in Blender 2.6.5 above is not valid any more

 cubedata = bpy.data.meshes['Cube']
Every Blender object has data assigned to it, depending on the type. In the case of a mesh, the data are of type Mesh. In the documentation, go to the top again, and look for the Mesh module. It will contain documentation for the Mesh type. You can also try

 dir(cubedata)

to get an idea about the available functions and properties. Try these:

 list(cubedata.vertices)
 list(cubedata.faces)

The first line will list the 8 vertices of the cube's mesh. The second line will list its 6 faces.

To get a member out of a list, you specify the index in square brackets, starting with 0. So:

 v = cubedata.vertices[0]

This will assign the first vertex of the cube to the variable v. By now, you already know how to use dir() to get a list of possibly interesting things in v, find out about its type with type(), and where to look for the API documentation. It is in the module Blender/Mesh, when you click one &quot;MVert&quot; under &quot;Classes&quot;.

 v.co

This will display the 3D coordinates of the first vertex. Now, what if we want to know the coordinates of all vertices? We could of course assign them all to a variable, but the real way to do this is using a looping constructs. There are numerous ways to do this, but one simple way looks like this:

 for v in cubedata.vertices: print(v.co)

The '''for variable in list:''' construct assigns each element of the list to the variable in turn, and then executes the commands after the colon with the variable having the value of one particular list element. In a real script, you will have much more than a single command after the colon - so you would write them in the following lines.

By now, you should know enough to try yourself at a real script in the next section.

== Creating a script ==

You can write scripts either in an external text editor, or in Blender's built in text editor. Move to a panel you wish to change to be the text editor, click the editor select button and choose &quot;text editor&quot; (shortcut) '''SHIFT+F11'''. Click the + New button at the bottom.  If you want, you can enable line numbers and syntax coloring with the buttons at the bottom. Create a new script with ''File'' → ''New'', paste the code below into it, and save it. Or alternatively, paste the code below into a file, and open that file with ''File'' → ''Open'' in Blender. As name choose something with the extension .py, for example wikibooks.py. Put it into Blender's user scripts path.

For different operating systems this is:
*Linux: ~/.blender/scripts
*Windows XP: C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts
*Windows XP (alt): C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts

 
*Windows Vista: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\.blender\scripts
*Mac OS X:
**Under Mac OSX the path is actually hidden in the blender.app so to know the path you would have to know that the script folder is actually hidden in the blender.app itself. Assuming that Blender is in the applications directory the path would be &quot;/Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/.blender/scripts&quot; If you try to open the .app contents from the finder you will notice that .blender section of the path is not visible, while blender will still be able to navigate to this folder.
** Right-click (or ctrl-click) the file &quot;blender&quot;, and select &quot;Show Package Contents&quot; in the popup-menu.  It will display all the hidden files under blender's folder, and select &quot;scripts&quot; folder inside it.
** To see this folder from the OSX terminal use the ls -a command (lists all folders/files even hidden) in the MacOS folder of the listed path. It is probably a good idea to create an alias to the scripts folder in the &quot;/Applications/blender-2.37a-OSX-10.3-powerpc&quot; folder so that scripts can be easily manipulated through the finder. I know that its confusing that Blender should have its script folder buried inside the app but it is necessary to keep the app portable and not require an install.
**A safer approach than the one above consists in keeping your scripts somewhere in your home folder: with this scheme, there is no risk of deleting your scripts when you upgrade your blender application, as they are not contained within its folder.  A method that follows this principle is as follows: create a folder that will contain your scripts (or some of them) inside your own home directory; then, instead of putting your files directly in the .../.blender/scripts/ folder discussed above, simply add a ''link'' to your script directory in the .../.blender/scripts/ folder (for instance with the &quot;ln -s&quot; Unix command, or by doing &quot;open /Applications/blender-2.37a-OSX-10.3-powerpc/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/.blender/scripts/&quot; [adapted to your version of blender] and then creating a link through the Finder, with File-&gt;Make Alias).  Blender will now find all the scripts that you put in your home directory: it will follow the link you created in its .../.blender/scripts/ folder and go to the corresponding folder in your own directory, and find all the python scripts you put there.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
#!BPY

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Name: 'Wikibooks'
Blender: 259
Group: 'Export'
Tooltip: 'Wikibooks sample exporter'
&quot;&quot;&quot;
import Blender
import bpy

def write(filename):
    out = open(filename, &quot;w&quot;)
    sce= bpy.data.scenes.active
    for ob in sce.objects:
        out.write(ob.type + &quot;: &quot; + ob.name + &quot;\n&quot;)
    out.close()

Blender.Window.FileSelector(write, &quot;Export&quot;)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, go back into the scripts window, and in its menu, click ''Scripts'' → ''Update Menus''. If you saved it into the right path, from now on there should be an entry &quot;Wikibooks&quot; in the ''File'' → ''Export'' menu. Try exporting any scene with it. It should open the file chooser dialog, and after you select a file and press the &quot;Export&quot; button, write a list of all objects in the scene into it. There will be one object per line, with the type, followed by a colon and the name.

How does it work? If you look at the script, you probably already know. But just in case, let's look at the script line by line. The first line contains this:

 #!BPY

It tells Blender that this is a Blender script, and therefore it will consider it when scanning for scripts. Next simply follows a string, enclosed in triple quotation marks, so it can span multiple lines.

 &quot;&quot;&quot;
 Name: 'Wikibooks'
 Blender: 259
 Group: 'Export'
 Tooltip: 'Wikibooks sample exporter'
 &quot;&quot;&quot;

It contains four items, which Blender uses to place the script into its menus. The name, group (submenu name), and tooltip, all enclosed in single quotes. And the Blender version this is for. Note the group name must be one of those predefined by Blender (check the submenus in its Scripts menu to see the valid names); if Blender doesn’t recognize the group name, the script will be put into the “Misc” submenu.

 import Blender
 import bpy

Remember how we said all functions from the bpy module start with &quot;Blender.&quot;? In the interactive shell, we could simply use them, but in a python script, all used modules must be declared with an import statement (if you want to directly use functions from the Blender module in a script, you can simply replace the import statement above with &quot;from Blender import *&quot;: no &quot;Blender.&quot; prefix is necessary any more; however, this slows down the loading of your script). So the above simply allows us to use the functions from the Blender module in our script.

the bpy module is new and will replace Blender for data access.

 def write(filename):

This defines a function in Python. The syntax is '''def name(parameters):'''. In our case, the name is &quot;write&quot;, and we have one parameter, called &quot;filename&quot;.

     out = open(filename, &quot;w&quot;)

Here we open a file for writing (the &quot;w&quot;), with the name passed to the function (filename). The python function &quot;open&quot; will open the file, and return a reference to it, which we store in the variable &quot;out&quot;.
    sce= bpy.data.scenes.active
    for ob in sce.objects:
        out.write(ob.type + &quot;: &quot; + ob.name + &quot;\n&quot;)

These three lines are our real export script. You already know what the first line does - first we get the current scene, then get a list of all objects in that scene, the for loop is assigning each one in turn to the variable &quot;ob&quot;. The second line writes to the file - first the type of the object, then the string &quot;: &quot;, then the name of the object, and finally a newline.

 Blender.Window.FileSelector(write, &quot;Export&quot;)

This is where execution of the script starts. It is simply a call of a Blender function (look it up in the API docs), which opens the file selector. It will display an &quot;Export&quot; button, and when the user clicks it, our function &quot;write&quot; from above gets called and is passed the selected filename.

This script isn't really very useful yet, but it shows the basics. You should now be able to e.g. also list all the materials in the scene. (Hint: They are just like objects, try to find them in the API docs.)

In the next section, we will learn how to export additional information about objects to our text file.

== Exporting a Mesh ==

Our export script lists the type and name of every object, but that's not very useful yet. If we want to load the exported data in another application, we need more. Let's try to export a mesh object in the OBJ format.

The example below is a cube in the OBJ file format.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
v 1.000000 1.000000 -1.000000
v 1.000000 -1.000000 -1.000000
v -1.000000 -1.000000 -1.000000
v -1.000000 1.000000 -1.000000
v 1.000001 1.000000 1.000000
v 0.999999 -1.000000 1.000000
v -1.000000 -1.000000 1.000000
v -1.000000 1.000000 1.000000
f 1 2 3 4
f 5 8 7 6
f 1 5 6 2
f 2 6 7 3
f 3 7 8 4
f 5 1 4 8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here is a simple obj export script that exports a selected mesh object, used to export the OBJ file above.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
import Blender
import bpy

def write_obj(filepath):
	out = file(filepath, 'w')
	sce = bpy.data.scenes.active
	ob = sce.objects.active
	mesh = ob.getData(mesh=1)
	for vert in mesh.verts:
		out.write( 'v %f %f %f\n' % (vert.co.x, vert.co.y, vert.co.z) )
	
	for face in mesh.faces:
		out.write('f')
		
		for vert in face.v:
			out.write( ' %i' % (vert.index + 1) )
		out.write('\n')
	out.close()
Blender.Window.FileSelector(write_obj, &quot;Export&quot;)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

This script will export an OBJ file that can be read by many applications. Let's look at what's going on.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
	sce = bpy.data.scenes.active
	ob = sce.objects.active
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Here we are getting the object you last selected in the current scene. This will raise an error if there are no selected objects, but its an easy way to test a new exporter.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
	mesh = ob.getData(mesh=1)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
This gets the objects linked datablock. At the moment we don't know its a mesh, another case where error checking would need to be added.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
	for vert in mesh.verts:
		out.write( 'v %f %f %f\n' % (vert.co.x, vert.co.y, vert.co.z) )
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Here we write a line for every vertex, using string formatting to replace the &quot;%f&quot; on the left, with the 3 values on the right.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
	for face in mesh.faces:
		out.write('f')
		
		for vert in face.v:
			out.write( ' %i' % (vert.index + 1) )
		out.write('\n')
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
In the OBJ format each face references a number of vertex indices.
For every face we have a line starting with &quot;f&quot;, then loop through the vertices in the face.
Just as mesh.verts are a list of all the vertices in a mesh, face.v is a list of verts in the face limited to 4 vertices maximum.
(where mesh and face are arbitrary variable names assigned to Mesh and MFace objects)
Every vertex writes its index on that same line with 1 added. This is because with the OBJ file format the first vertex is indexed at 1, whereas with Python and Blender the first item in a list is 0.

A new line is written so the next face will start on a new line. - in python '\n' represents a new line when written to a file.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Different terminology is used in different programming languages to mean different things.  The same things in different languages can have different names.  Programs, Procedures, Functions, Subroutines, Subprograms, Subqueries ... these words all have very similar meanings.  The issues or differences are whether they can stand alone; 

We can call an object, it executes and performs a complex process.  Whether that object is called any one of the above list depends on what programming language it is written in, whether a human being can call it, or whether it has to be called by another program or one of the other names on the list.

== Subroutines and functions ==
In general programming theory, when an institution using the programs can have libraries of millions of programs collectively with billions of lines of source code, we want to avoid duplication of having the same code in multiple places.  Suppose something needs changing.  There is a new error message to add to the collection.  Customer numbers just went from being 6 digit #s to 8 digits.  There is a new currency, such as the Euro, to be handled.  If this stuff was referenced in every single program that worked with it, we could have tens of thousands of programs to have to update to handle the change.  But if there are sub-programs to handle different scenarios, then when that scenario changes, the only update is to the relevant sub-program.  Similarly, when we write a new program, many elements of what it needs are already in existence, such as accessing a particular file to get a particular kind of data, calculating on-hand inventory.  Instead of writing many lines of source code to do that function, with that code replicated across millions of programs, we can call the standard sub-program that performs that function.

In some languages there are parameters to be passed from the calling program to the called program.  The secondary program causes those values to be altered, then returns control to the primary program.  This architecture, of one program calling a secondary program to do specialize work for it, can in fact go many levels deep.  The different programs, that are calling each other, can be written in many different languages.  This is done for two big reasons: organization of overall functions into logical manageable pieces; and different languages are better suited to different types of functions.



=== Subroutines and &quot;sub contents&quot; in RPG ===
RPG has sections of code to handle activities like file definition, tables &amp; arrays defined, input, output, communications with other systems and other programs, various kinds of data structures defined, and calculations.  The calculation section has a main routine and any number of subroutines which can be called from the main routine and from each other. 

In RPG, a chunk of source code is called a subroutine if it has a defined begin point and end point and is embedded within the main program.  Some point in the main program calls the subroutine.  Control goes to the start of the subroutine which then has control until either it gets to the end point or prematurely hits an exit statement within the body of the subroutine.  Here is an example:

 Main calculations routine
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 EXSR $TOP
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 End of main routine

The EXSR command means Execute Subroutine.  Subroutine names can include letters, symbols, and numbers, but may not start with a number.  Since a compilation includes a cross index of all elements used in the program, it is customary to use a special character at the start of certain kinds of functions, so that they all show up in a consistent location in the cross index, such as currency symbol for subroutines, and some other symbol for output to printer.

At the beginning of any subroutine it is good programming practice to place comments with a summary statement or explanation of what the function is of the $TOP subroutine, such as to handle what is to be printed at the top of the report.

 Comments
 BEGSR
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 RPG statement 
 EXCPT @PAGE
 EXCPT @TITLE
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 EXCPT @HEAD
 RPG statement
 RPG statement
 ENDSR

BEGSR is the begin subroutine statement, while ENDSR is the end subroutine statement.  EXCPT is the statement that identifies some type of output to a printer or printer-like file.  Data can be written to a log or other object that is in a format similar to printout, sequential lines of stuff.

When control is transferred from this program to another program, called by this one, then this one calls that other program a sub-program.  Sub=programs contain other types of RPG content such as file definition, input output etc.  A sub-program does not need to access any files.  It can get all of its data from data structures populated by the calling program.

These subroutines and subprograms are merely a way to organize the program into logical chunks of the work to be done.  We can think of them as being black boxes which are fed in various different standard pieces of information, only to return predictable results to the main program.  Thus when a program needs to be maintained, we can effectively ignore that part of the program that has nothing to do with the maintenance effort.  This is critical when we are maintaining programs whose collective source code, main routines and subroutines and subprogram contents, can run to hundreds of thousands of lines of code.

If you were to compare a listing of the actual source code of an RPG program, and what is there at time of compilation, you would probably see a lot of stuff in the compile that is not explicitly in the source code.  This usually gets there one of two ways. 

If using a standard externally described object, such as a file or data structure, the source code only needs to specify that object with a few lines of code, which one, and what changes are needed for its handling in this program.  At compile time, the whole layout of the file, such as all columns of the table, is called into what gets compiled.

Another way, when using standard subroutines, or the code for calling standard subprograms, that are to be replicated in millions of other programs, is not to have that code within the source code of every one of the millions of programs, but to have a single line of code identifying what standard code is to be brought in here, and if in this program any of it is to be referenced by other names.

Very few other languages can be embedded within  RPG source code, such as [[SQL/400]].  RPG programs can transfer control to other programs, which RPG calls sub-programs.  Those other programs can be written in any language.  Depending on language, those programs need to be written so as to expect to be called, and the code, associated with this handshake with the calling program, can make it impractical to run the program in some way other than being so called.

Different kinds of error messages, with their associated help links, can be stored in different libraries based on the nature of the problem.  A person, using this program, may have called for a record that does not exist, tried to get at values that are out of bounds. 
The most hours in one day is 25, which is only on the day that gets changed due to daylight savings.  If someone tries to enter what activities occurred in a factory in one day, and the total time by one factory worker is more than 25 hours, this is an example of input that is out of bounds.
The program needs to communicate back to the user what the problem is.  Part of the message handling can use a sub-program that only knows what error message is involved by some reference code.  The actual current error message is not explicitly referenced in the sub-program that handles error messages, so that it can handle any different error message.  The only parameters it needs are those that define how to access the particular error message and its associated references, such as the manner in which a user may interact with it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How are the results of the latest SAT test? What is the average height of females under 21 in Zambia? How does beer consumption among college students at engineering college compare to college students in liberal arts colleges?

To answer these questions, we would collect data and put them in a form that is easy to summarize, visualize, and discuss. Loosely speaking, the collection and aggregation of data result in a distribution. Distributions are most often in the form of a histogram or a table. That way, we can &quot;see&quot; the data immediately and begin our scientific inquiry.

For example, if we want to know more about students' latest performance on the SAT, we would collect SAT scores from ETS, compile them in a way that is pertinent to us, and then form a distribution of these scores. The result may be a data table or it may be a plot. Regardless, once we &quot;see&quot; the data, we can begin asking more interesting research questions about our data.

The distributions we create often parallel distributions that are mathematically generated. For example, if we obtain the heights of all high school students and plot this data, the graph may resemble a normal distribution, which is generated mathematically. Then, instead of painstakingly collecting heights of all high school students, we could simply use a normal distribution to approximate the heights without sacrificing too much accuracy. 

In the study of statistics, we focus on mathematical distributions for the sake of simplicity and relevance to the real-world. Understanding these distributions will enable us to visualize the data easier and build models quicker. However, they cannot and do not replace the work of manual data collection and generating the actual data distribution. 

What percentage lie within a certain range? Distributions show what percentage of the data lies within a certain range. So, given a distribution, and a set of values, we can determine the probability that the data will lie within a certain range. 

The same data may lead to different conclusions if it is interposed on different distributions. So, it is vital in all statistical analysis for data to be put onto the correct distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wording ==

The introduction states &quot;A polynomial over some commutative ring with identity R is an expression in the form&quot;.  I first misread this as &quot;commutative ring with (identity R)&quot; rather than &quot;(commutative ring with identity) [named] R&quot;.  The context makes it pretty clear the latter is correct, but is there a better wording so that first timers don't make the same mistake I did?  I'm still learning these subjects myself, but it seems commutative rings with identity are the norm so the &quot;with identity&quot; part could either be omitted or parenthesized.

== Proving irreducibility ==

In showing that q(x)=x^4+x+2 is irreducible in Z_3, it's demonstrated that there are no linear factors by evaluating q(0), q(1), q(2), q(3), and q(4).  However, since we're in Z_3, isn't evaluating q(3) and q(4) redundant with q(0) and q(1)?

== Division Algorithm ==

I beleive the line:
Furthermore, we have the degree of r(x) ≤ degree of f(x)
should read:
Furthermore, we have the degree of r(x) ≤ degree of '''g'''(x)

I was going to say the same, only that the proper remark would be:&lt;br&gt;
... the degree of r(x) '''&lt;''' degree of '''g'''(x)&lt;br&gt;
The original statement might be right, but it's probably not as relevant as one regarding g(x). --[[User:Sgirbau|Sgirbau]] ([[User talk:Sgirbau|talk]]) 18:15, 8 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Purodha. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Purodha~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Downchuck.  You left a message for me on my user page indicating you wanted to chat.  What can I help you with? 
*Specifically, I'm curious about the possibility of copyright on Griffin's list of Journals. While I've seen all of the movies on the abutting list, I've certainly not witnessed even the existance of all of the Journals. Should I cut it down to Journals widely available (by quality of University library collections), should I trim it only to Journals I can personally review/confirm topicality? Otherwise, any general thoughts about the [[Wikiversity:Social Sciences]]?
**Copying the entire list from Griffin seems like it would breach copyright laws, but I'm certainly not an expert.  I would suggest following his format but modifying it extensively so no accusation of copyright infringement could be leveled.  There is certainly nothing wrong with creating your own list of journals in Communications, but you may want to see how many you can verify and point the titles to their corresponding web pages.  If they don't have websites, that may be a good way to determine which ones you want to keep: drop the ones that don't have websites.  As for the movies and such, that is clearly drawing very heavily on Griffin's work.  If I were you, I would probably put that list on hold until you can either modify it (by adding or replacing) or replace it entirely.  

:I've extensively modified Griffin's list of movies, adding more R-rated films, and removing all of the films I've not seen. But I understand that I'm walking a fine line. However, as a movie buff, I constantly quote movies to (fail to) explain concepts/thoughts. It typically fails because of the esoteric nature of any given person's catalog of films. But I think it's a wholey appropriate thing to include in a course Appendix. I'll take your advice (and mine) and renovate the Journal listings. I'll also spend more time revising the movie listing, so as to exclude movies listed by Griffin, and reduce his unwilling contribution to something negligible. If that doesn't work, I'll just remove all movies he mentions and restructure the categories.  [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 19:56, 12 July 2005 (UTC) I've reconsidered. The media titles should be supported by (an educational) discourse analysis. The list alone is bland and of little value. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 19:05, 13 July 2005 (UTC) I feel that I've wandered off track. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 21:16, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

*Also, [[User:jxn]] on [[Talk:Wikiversity:Social Sciences]] brings up a point. Most of the theory I focus on is from the Social sciences, but there are large areas of rhetorical criticism that are identified with Humanities.
:[[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 06:22, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
**This is an interesting issue.  Communications is generally included in the Humanities divisions of universities despite the fact that it draws heavily on social scientific theory and is increasingly turning to social scientific methods of research.  I have to admit I am not particularly familiar with Communications (I took one course in my undergraduate training on The Social Construction of Reality - Berger and Luckmann), so my opinion here may be tainted by the current setup of universities.  I would probably suggest keeping it in the Humanities section for now.  Perhaps this will change over time.  But if this division of Wikibooks develops well, I could certainly see the utility in cross-listing it in the social sciences.  I hope this helps. 
:Cross-listing makes some sense. I took some time reviewing various University websites, and Communications placed in the Social sciences on many of them. There are more however, that use the title, Humanities &amp; Social sciences, and others that simply use Liberal Arts. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 19:56, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
::The [[Wikiversity:School of Literature and English Studies]] provides most of the Humanities courses offered within the Communications catalog of my college. This allows the [[Wikiversity:School of Communication]] a greater focus on social science. There is some overlap that will need to be addressed, eventually. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 06:57, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
----
One other thought... If you want someone to go over whatever you develop in terms of theory that is derived from the social sciences, just drop me a line on my talk page and I'll stop by to take a look.  Best... 

:Once it's developed, in terms of defensible substance, I certainly will. Many thanks. [[User:Downchuck|Downchuck]] 19:56, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yo, I see you're doing work on the Super Smash Brothers Strategy Guide.  Thanks for any help you can offer.  How long have you played SSB64?  Are you acquainted with all of the stuff that I've written thus far?  If so, please continue updating and editing.  I plan to have a comprehensive guide to this game after I'm through, so any additions are accepted.  Also, if you are in the Washington State area, you should look me up for some Smash.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called FabioB. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name FabioB~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Ingredients ==
*1 [[cookbook:cabbage|cabbage]], chopped
*3 [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]] cloves, minced
*3 large [[cookbook:beet|beet]]s, cubed (or 2 cans of beets)
*5 large [[cookbook:carrot|carrot]]s, chopped
*1  large [[cookbook:onion|onion]], chopped
*4 stalks of [[cookbook:celery|celery]], chopped
*2 lb. [[cookbook:meat|meat]], cubed
*1 lb. stew bones
*3 [[cookbook:lemon|lemon]]s (optional)
*2 24 oz. cans crushed [[cookbook:tomato|tomato]]es
*½ cup [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]] (optional)

== Procedure ==
# If you are using fresh beets, you first need to place them in boiling water for between 90 minutes and two hours.  For better flavor bake at 350 °F for 90 minutes. When they are soft enough that a fork will go in easily then they are done.  Put them in a sink or large bowl full of cool water.  Once they are cool pick up a beet and press your thumbs into the skin to start peeling them, sometimes they are not soft enough for this and you just need to cook them longer. If you use canned beets they will be ready right out of the can.
# While the beets are cooking you should start cooking the meat.  Place the meat and bones into a large 12 qt. stock pot.  Add the two cans of crushed tomatoes and a similar quantity of water.  Stir it up and bring to a boil.
# While the meat and beets are cooking chop up all of the vegetables, mince the garlic and squeeze the lemons.
# After the meat has been boiling for between an hour and 90 minutes then you should add all of the vegetables except the beets which are still cooking, the lemon juice and the sugar.
# Finish peeling and cubing the beets, when the simmering vegetables are soft add the beets, stir well.  Then add as much or as little lemon juice and sugar as you like, to suit your own taste.  Cook for five more minutes and it’s done.

==Ingredients==
===Crust===
*5 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbs]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], melted 
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] chocolate wafer crumbs, or the equivalent in chocolate [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]] or chocolate [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|Graham crackers]]
===Filling===
*3 packages (8 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (235g) each) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], at room temperature
*1 cup brown [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], packed
*5 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s
*4 ounces (215g) (4 squares) [[Cookbook:Chocolate|semisweet chocolate]], melted
===Frosting===
*6 ounces (150g) (6 squares) semisweet chocolate, melted 
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]

==Procedure==
#Place rack in center of the oven. Preheat oven to 150 °C (300 °F).
#If starting with whole cookies, crackers, or wafers, place them in a sturdy plastic bag a few at a time and crush using a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]], or grind using a [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]].
#Mix together chocolate crumbs and melted butter.
#Press crumb mixture into bottom and sides of 9-inch springform pan. 
#In a large bowl, beat together sugar and eggs at medium speed, slowly adding cream cheese, until smooth and fluffy. 
#Spoon half of cream cheese mixture into crust.
#Melt 4 ounces of chocolate using a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]] or, with care, a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]].  Stir into remaining cream cheese mixture until well blended. 
#Drizzle over batter in crust.  Draw a spoon or other implement through the batter a few times to make swirls. Spread evenly.
#Bake cheesecake for 50 minutes.  After the first 30 minutes has gone by, place aluminum foil on top to prevent cracking and scorching.  
#Cool completely.
#Cover with plastic wrap, and chill for about 2 hours, up to several days.
#Transfer cheesecake to a serving plate.
#Uncover cheesecake; carefully remove side of pan.
=== Frosting ===
#Melt remaining chocolate.
#Mix with sour cream.
#Spread over cake, and chill to set.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Brown sugar is not absolutely necessary (can substitute granulated), but it provides better flavor.
*If no electric mixer is available, the cream cheese can be mixed with egg yolks one-at-a-time before the whites are added.  Unless you find separating eggs extremely difficult, this will be worthwhile for the effort saved in mixing.
*Without a springform pan, a cake this stiff will require that at least the first piece be broken up in the process of serving.  Fortunately, it's often easy to find someone who [[Cookbook:Aesthetics|doesn't care]].
*Without aluminum foil, the top of the cake will crack and brown somewhat, but frosting covers it effectively, making it practically unnoticeable.

This page describes policies for pages in the [[Cookbook]]. It is a &quot;living document&quot; so it will change over time to reflect the standards created by Cookbook [[Cookbook:Contributors|contributors]].

==Recipe Formatting==
Recipes should be formatted according to the [[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template|recipe template]].

== Pages needing work ==
Pages which need work should be tagged with the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookwork}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template, and will appear in [[:Category:Cookbook pages needing work]]. When a recipe has been sufficiently improved, the template should be removed.

==Naming Conventions==
===Cookbook Pages===

==== Case ====
The de-facto naming convention for Cookbook pages is [[w:Title case|title case]].

==== Name ====
Recipes should be named according to their traditional name, their origin, or their ingredients. Avoid naming recipes for people, unless it is a well-known recipe by that name. 

Recipes with a non-English name that have a common English name should be named with their common English name. For example, the primary name for [[Cookbook:Khaeng Keaw Wan]] should be [[Cookbook:Thai Green Curry]]. If necessary or desired a redirect from the name in the original language can be created. In cases where the non-English name is the common name, that name should be used, as in [[Cookbook:Huevos Rancheros]].

Recipes names with special characters ([[w:Diacritic|diacritics]], etc) should be primarily spelled with simple [[w:ASCII|ASCII]] characters and a redirect should be created with the special characters included.

==== Special Diets ====
Recipes for a [[Cookbook:Special Diets|special diet]] which are substantially adjusted variations of a normal recipe should be denoted by the diet name in parentheses after the name of the recipe. A vegan variation of [[Cookbook:Chili]] would be [[Cookbook:Chili (Vegan)]]; a gluten-free variation of [[Cookbook:Brownie]] would be [[Cookbook:Brownies (Gluten-Free)]]; a lactose-free variation of [[Cookbook:Milkshake]] would be [[Cookbook:Milkshake (Lactose-Free)]]. Recipes which adhere to a special diet, but are not variations for that specific diet ''should not'' be named in this fashion; instead only the appropriate category should be added. Trivial variations should be listed on the recipe page itself.

==== Duplicate Recipes and Disambiguation Pages ====
When there is more than one recipe for a single type of food, there are several ways to resolve the situation:
# If one recipe is of poor quality, delete it.
# If one recipe can be expressed as a variation upon the other, include it in the variations section and delete the original.
# If the recipes can be merged into a single recipe, merge them and delete the originals.
# Create a disambiguation page for the 'abstract' type of food (using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cookdp}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template as a header) and give each recipe a unique name.

In the last case, the distinguishing name should be as descriptive of the unique qualities of the recipe as possible. For example, a disambiguation page is [[Cookbook:Lasagne]] which links to [[Cookbook:Traditional Lasagne]], [[Cookbook:Ricotta Lasagne]], and [[Cookbook:Lasagne with bean sauce]]. If there is not an appropriately descriptive way to distinguish the recipes, roman numerals should be used, as in [[Cookbook:Hummus I]].

===Cookbook Categories===
Cookbook-related categories are not entirely standardized, but these generally seem to be in the &quot;normal&quot; [[w:Wikipedia:Naming conventions (capitalization)|wikipedia form]] of capitalized first letter, lowercased first letter elsewhere (except with proper nouns).

For recipe categorization by ingredient, origin, diet, meal type, and recipe type classifications there is a tendency to use the &quot;___ recipes&quot; format e.g.:
* [[:Category:Egg recipes]] (by ingredient)
* [[:Category:Italian recipes]] (by origin)
* [[:Category:Vegan recipes]] (by diet)
* [[:Category:Cake recipes]] (by recipe type)
* [[:Category:Dessert recipes]] (by meal type)

For ingredient categorization, a plural form is generally used, e.g.:
* [[:Category:Fats and oils]]
* [[:Category:Cheese]]

==Featured Recipe and Ingredient==
First, please know and understand, the 'Featured recipe' and 'Featured ingredient' categories are actually just repositories for links to the complete versions of recipes and ingredients that either:
* are currently in the rotation to be displayed on the main Cookbook page; or 
* may have formerly been in the rotation to be displayed on the main Cookbook page, but are now 'retired'.
Adding a Featured recipe or Featured ingredient category tag to a recipe does not, by any means, put that recipe or ingredient on the current list of recipes or ingredients that can be displayed on the main Cookbook page. 

===Selection===
Cookbook contributors and users should who would like to suggest that a particular recipe or ingredient be displayed on the main Cookbook page are welcome to tag worthy modules with [[:Category:Featured recipe candidates]] or [[:Category:Featured ingredient candidate]].

'Featured recipes candidates' and 'Featured ingredients candidates' should be chosen to highlight the potential of the [[Cookbook]]. They should therefore be well written and wikified. 
In addition, each Featured recipe candidate should:
* have a picture of the finished recipe (if possible)
* follow the [[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template|recipe template]]
* have a recipe summary (see template above)
* have proper categories (by ingredient, diet, region, etc as appropriate)
* be an entire food item (i.e. not a component as in pie crust, sauces)
And each Featured ingredient candidate should:
* have a picture of the ingredient
* have proper categories (by ingredient, diet, region, etc as appropriate)

===Procedure===
&lt;b&gt;To rotate the Featured recipe and the Featured ingredient shown on the main Cookbook page [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Cookbook:Table_of_Contents&amp;action=purge click here].&lt;/b&gt; This will allow you, and &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;everyone throughout the world&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; who accesses the main Cookbook page thereafter, to see a different, randomly selected, Featured recipe or Featured ingredient from the rotation.

Actually adding to the list of recipes or ingredients in the rotation of recipes and ingredients shown on the main cookbook page can be problematic:

* It is not presently possible to adjust the list of &lt;u&gt;Featured recipes&lt;/u&gt; displayed on the main Cookbook page, primarily because the same rotation is also included in the main Wikimedia page and is carefully controlled for that reason.

* To add to the list of &lt;u&gt;Featured ingredients&lt;/u&gt; displayed on the main Cookbook page see [[Template:Featured ingredient]].  To prepare you in advance,  it requires a bit of programming knowledge, a previously researched candidate, the name of an image, ready to cut and paste, the prior composition of a suitable one sentence summary, and several other steps to be successful.

===Usage notes===
#&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Recipesummary}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;:
#* All fields are '''optional''', see [[Template:Recipe summary/doc#Examples]] for examples on using this template.
#* The &quot;Category&quot; tries to resolve to an actual category, but does ''not'' include the recipe in that category.
#* Rating is between 1 and 5 inclusive.
#&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nutritionsummary}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is shorthand for &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Nutrition Summary}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Its arguments are in the order they are displayed.
#&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Seasonality}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;:
#* The numbers entered are 1,2 or 3 for each month. 1 means the ingredient is not in season, 2 means the ingredient is not at it´s best, but is grown by natural means and 3 means the ingredient is in season. These values are entered for the northern hemisphere. The values for the southern hemisphere are automatically rotated 6 months.
#* Should preferably be accomplished by a small paragraph explaining the details of the seasonality of the ingredient. The page should also:
#** be tagged with one or more of [[:Category:Spring ingredients]], [[:Category:Summer ingredients]],   [[:Category:Autumn ingredients]], [[:Category:Winter ingredients]] or [[:Category:Ingredients available all year]].
#** be added to the tables on the [[cookbook:Seasonality|seasonality page]].
#&lt;nowiki&gt;{{SeasonalitySpec}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is used to enter the values for the southern hemisphere manually. The template has 24 number fields one per month per hemisphere, from Jan to Dec, northern hemisphere first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The question of dating for Van Dwellers really has two sides to it. First, it can possibly scare some people when they discover they are dating a van dweller. Second, it can possibly scare a van dweller to be dating.

Many books about dating provide advice that is applicable to van dwellers, just as it is to the rest of society. Basically, before even contemplating dating, there are some things to consider:

# Do you have a way to maintain good personal hygiene?
# Do you have a steady way to make money? (Printing your own does not count).
# Do you have a stable place to live?

These are important questions to ask before beginning dating. It will be very difficult to get dates (or at least second dates) without good personal hygiene. Dating can be very well done on the cheap, but it will occasionally require some amount of money. 

The third question may be of most interest to some van dwellers. A very small percentage of the population is open to the idea of dating somebody that they view as &quot;homeless,&quot; even though you may not consider yourself homeless. As such, you probably only have 3 options:

# Only date people that accept your chosen mode of living.
# Just don't let people know.
# Don't date.

Since you're reading this, you probably don't consider #3 an option. Finding people that fit #1 may be difficult, but not impossible. Thus, we go to #2.

Since many people consider honesty to be one of those big cornerstones of a successful relationship, this one can get a bit tricky. Things can get even worse when a dating partner starts to question &quot;why we never go back to your place.&quot; Therefore, it may be advisable to let somebody know about your situation after a certain number of dates if you plan on pursuing a steady relationship.

This is strictly a personal philosophy, but I would tell a potential partner somewhere around date number five, if I had any inclination of pursuing a long term relationship. My approach would be to start a discussion about the desire for personal freedom and the escape of rampant consumerism and the rat race, and use that as a segue into explaining my living choice.

Of course, if you pick up your date in at his/her house in your van, then they might perhaps be able to figure it out on their own and simply ask. :)

Considering the fact that you have chosen this mode of living for one reason or another, you may actually end up finding potential partners amongst people that are of similar mindset and inclination. If this is an idea you are open to, consider plugging into your local &quot;alternative&quot; community. Most cities have some semblance of a community of people interested in simpler lifestyles, reduced consumerism, and some sort of activism related to such concepts. Participating in groups, activities, and gatherings for these sort of things could provide a plugin to a pool of eligible partners that are open to the van dwelling lifestyle.

Well, yes I am aware... Me, together with a small interest group are making a course, based on guidelines i posted, that will utilize the text already there, and add much more content. there are real people here waiting for this course, so it is planned to release weekly. Please tell, just which part exactly you do not like. --[[User:Lastguru|Lastguru]] 04:09, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

== want to contribute? ==

just in case my first statement was too excluding, noone stops other people contributing to the new lesson thread... I hope when there will be some content (in, like 4 months) it will be possible to make these the front-page lessons... will see...--[[User:Lastguru|Lastguru]] 04:24, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

== Old Grammer lessons ==

Since you seem to be the chief contributer to them, are new lessons being made and the old lessons are obsolete or have you just given up on them? --[[User:Balloonguy|Balloonguy]] 21:20, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

no i didn't gave up on them... the lessons marked as old should be restructurized a little bit. they are still great, and i am hoping to continue them. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 22:02, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Portuguese grammar is similar to the grammar of other [[w:Romance languages|Romance languages]] (or even English) and like them there is a strong [[w:latin|latin]] structure that is always being reconstructed. The learner shall find archaic constructions being replaced by modern ones, mostly in colloquial language but even in formal and standard languages.

Firstly, we shall see that Portuguese has a flexible [[w:Word order|Subject-Verb-Object]] order, just like in English and there is no [[w:Declension|case]] declensation. Adjectives are generally placed after the noun. In some cases, there are some subtle differences in placing them after or before the noun, like in French.

The noun has singular and plural forms, but it is interesting to note that, unlike in English, the adjectives also are declinated. There are just two genders: masculine and feminine. The latin neuter gender was absorbed by the masculine one.

Portuguese verbs are slightly complicated, with lots of [[w:Grammatical tense|tenses]] and [[w:Grammatical mood|moods]]. There are also some tenses which are equivalent: like ''eu fizera'' and ''eu tinha feito'' (I had done).

Some peculiarities are remarkable. The Personal Infinitive verb conjugation is found in few languages, such as [[w:Gallician language|Gallician]] or [[w:Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. Portuguese has also developed the Subjunctive mood in such way 
doesn't found in other Romance languages and is used even in familiar language. Although, the most special feature of this language is the nasals. The nasal vowels - very abundant - has developed in the same way as in French. But the nasal diphtongues found in no language but Portuguese, probably . Although these diphtongues - ão, õe - are difficult for foreigners to pronounce, there is usually no confusion if they are mispronouced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Blender 2.36 HotKeys ==

Ok, I converted this Hotkeys from official [http://www.blender.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=documentation&amp;file=index Blender PDF] file. Please use official Hotkeys names in your articles! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 14:21, 3 May 2005 (UTC)

== ideas for organization ==

I'd like to start a discussion about how this book should be organized.  Perhaps the organization should be changed, or maybe it should stay the way it currently is.  Here's an idea:

Create a page for each shortcut.  The URL would be formatted very specifically; for example:

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Edit Mode/EKEY]]

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Vertex Paint Mode/VKEY]]

[[Blender 3D: Hotkeys/Object Mode/SHIFT-DKEY]]

This way there could be very detailed information about each of the shortcuts in the different modes.

Then on the Mode Pages, for example the Edit Mode page, the shortcuts could be listed by function....

'''Edit Mode'''

'''''Mesh Modeling'''''

A

*AKEY - select all

E

*EKEY - extrude

etc...

: It's good idea to explain more detailed information about every HotKey, maybe even with examples or links to tutorial examples, but I think that is also good to have all HotKeys in one place (as it is) and from here links to more detailed explanations as you said [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]]. I would like to see here also keyboard drawing with color marked HotKeys large enough that can be printed and used on actual keyboard. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 17:30, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:: I just learned something using Template:whatever and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, let me try it out, I think this will help. --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 13:28, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

::: Check this out.  Follow the subpages I've created and take a look at the way these &lt;nowiki&gt;{{templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; work.  We can then embed the same hotkey instructions on any Blender book page anywhere in wikibooks using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{templates}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  Check it out: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_HotKeys/new

: Cool! This looks nice and useful! --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:59, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

== Blender 2.37a HotKeys Update ==

New HotKeys are marked with &lt;font color=red&gt;*&lt;/font color&gt;. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 13:21, 1 Jul 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">It's not at all uncommon to require information concerning rotation on a robot, whether from arm or manipulator axis motion to drive wheel speed. Rotary encoders can be found in several varieties, most commonly mechanical or using photodetectors. In mechanical encoders, electrical contacts periodically connect, usually to drive a terminal high or low. These electrical pulses are then used for information. Photodetector encoders can be made smaller and operate much quicker. Typically, a reflective sensor will shine on a marked reflective surface, or a photointerruptor will shine through a disc with transparent and opaque sections, such that the amplitude of received light causes high and low electrical pulses in the receiver. These pulses are then decoded by external circuitry.

==Encoding==
	Depending on the type and reliability of information needed, the patterning on the rotary encoder will be increasingly complex. If only rotational speed is required, a simple alternating pattern will do, but if both speed and direction are needed, more encoded information is required. Encoding position will inherently yield information regarding velocity and direction, as comparing the direction of change in position will give direction of rotation, where the change in position with respect to time will (by definition) indicate speed.
	The specific type of position encoding will depend on the precision required, as well as the reliability: how much of an error in measured rotational position due to an error in reading the encoded information, is acceptable in the application.

==Measuring Rotational Speed==
[[Image:Incremental encoder.gif|thumb|Example of simple speed-detection rotary encoder]]
	For some applications, only rotational speed needs to be considered. If a toothed wheel which is mechanically limited to spinning a single direction is being measured, the direction is already known, and only the velocity remains. Perhaps a feedback system is being developed for drive speed on a robot, and an encoder on the axle will enable the controller to calibrate speed by varying PWM values; if the controller enables the motor to spin in a specific direction, all it requires is the rotational speed. All that is necessary to measure speed is a single alternating pattern causing the detector to emit a pulsetrain. The pulse rate will be directly proportional to the rotational speed; measuring the time between consecutive rising (or falling) edges and dividing that into the angle of rotation represented by a pulse will yield the rate of rotation. 

:&lt;math&gt;\omega \approx {{{2 \pi} \over n} \over {(T_1 - T_0)}}, ~~~ where~n = pulses~per~revolution
&lt;/math&gt;

If the rate is changing during the time of the measurement, the calculated rate will be an average approximating the instantaneous rate. This is where precision comes into play – the more pulses per rotation, the shorter the time between measurements, and the closer the approximation is to correct. Anyone familiar with calculus will recognize that the rate of change of position with respect to time is a derivative, and the definition of the derivative states that as the timestep across which a measurement for approximation is taken approaches zero, the result is equal to the derivative at that time.

	Measuring the difference in the calculated velocities of successive pulses can give an approximation of rotational acceleration as well.

==Measuring Direction==
[[Image:Incremental directional encoder.gif|thumb|Two-row encoder for finding speed and direction]]
	Assume a machine is tuning its PWM routines for powering the drive wheels. The controller obviously needs to know the rotational speed of the wheels so it can determine the speed outputs for given duty cycles. But what if the machine is placed on a hill? It starts to roll backward and the controller sees a substantial rotational speed for no input, which messes up the entire calibration process. If the controller were able to determine that the wheel was spinning backward, it would know to ignore the speed information.
	In order to determine direction with a rotary encoder, there must be at least two patterns on the disk, so there is a reference for the direction of change. The simplest way to achieve this is with two alternating patters that are half a pulse out of phase with each other.

	If the disc is rotating in a particular direction (in this case, such that the pattern slides to the left), the rising (or falling) edge of channel A will be detected before that of channel B; if rotation is in the opposite direction, the edge of channel B will be detected first. By testing for which pattern's edges are detected first, the direction of rotation can be determined. The time between pulses for a single channel can be measured to approximate rotational speed. However, combining detections from the two channels gives an effective pulse rate double that of a single channel, which halves the measuring time and doubles precision.
	A means of measuring speed and direction with a single channel exists as well. Two receivers are placed on a single channel spaced half a pulse width apart, so that as the disc rotates, one sensor will be in state as the other transitions. The order in which the two sensors transition into a state is dependent on the direction of rotation of the disc.

==Measuring Position==
[[Image:Binary_encoder.gif|thumb|Simple binary encoder example]]
[[Image:Gray_Code_encoder.gif|thumb|Simple Gray code encoder example]]
	The simplest way to determine an angular position on a rotary encoder is to divide the disc into segments and imprint each segment with a unique pattern. The more segments the disc is divided into, the more precision is gained in knowing the location at a given time (each segment will cover a span of angles, so there will be uncertainty, but more segments will give fewer degrees per segment). More segments, however, require more unique identifiers, which means a more complex scheme. This discussion is limited to digital-signal encoders, where the possible outputs for any given channel are limited to 0 or 1. This is conducive to a binary encoding scheme, where each segment is imprinted with a unique binary number. The number of unique IDs required depends on the number of segments; the number of channels is equal to log2(n) where n is the number of segments. A disc with 8 segments has a resolution of 360° / 8 = 45° per segment, and requires log2(8) = 3 separate channels. For a doubling of the number of segments, precision is doubled with an increase of only one pattern channel.

==Reliability==
One of the problems with using a binary encoding scheme is detector error. There's no guarantee that every channel is going to transition at the same time, which can cause a misread of a segment's ID. If the section of the disc below the detector is transitioning from one segment to the next, briefly the decoder might read only part of the bits correctly. Assume a standard eight-segment binary encoding scheme, where segments are numbered from 0 to 8 sequentially: if the transition from segment 000 to segment 001 doesn't read the rising edge correctly, your read is off by one space, which for the moment is negligible. If, however, it's transitioning from segment 011 to segment 100, and the least significant bit is read in first, briefly your controller will think it's transitioned to 010, in the complete opposite direction. If the most significant bit is read in first, it'll think it jumped from 011 to 111, on the complete opposite side of the wheel. Transition errors when a single bit changes can often be considered negligible, as the error in calculated position is 1. Errors from multi-bit transitions can be catastrophic.

==Gray Code==

Gray code is a specific type of binary pattern in which there is only a single bit changing during a transition from one element to the next. Being a binary pattern, Gray codes use the same number of channels for the same number of specific patterns; they are just ordered differently. Binary uses patterns in a numerically sequential order; Gray code does not. Encoding positions using this method will require additional software or hardware to decode the ID (as a simple binary conversion will not yield a sequentially-ordered set of segments), but the benefits for the reliability of hardware are substantial – as only a single bit changes during each transition, then the maximum error in detected position for an error in pattern reception is 1 segment.
	Gray code can be written out bitwise in much the same way binary can. In binary, the least significant bit alternates from 0 to 1 every step; the next bit alternates every two steps, the next every four and so on. In Gray code, each bit holds a pattern of 0-1-1-0; the least bit holds each element for one step; the next bit holds each two steps, the next four and so on. It can be noticed that two-channel Gray code is identical to the two-channel pattern used to find rotational direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prerequisites: Addition

Subtraction deals with the taking away of numbers, like number a from number b so that: a &gt;= b while b &gt; a. Such a case is with:

20 - 10 = 10.

a = 20 and b = 10.

So a - b = 10, a &gt;= b is true, and b &gt; a is initially true.

Subtraction is the inverse of addition, meaning that it is the opposite.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rounding is a function that deals with a sort of &quot;evening&quot; of numbers, to make them closer to a specific target, say a 5 or a 10, in this we say a number is nicely rounded, or '''round'''.

Here is an example:

Number a is 23.

(a):
While our number remains at 23, we could either move it up (to 25) or down (to 20). Since the number is closer to 20, we make the number 20.

(b): Our number is now 26. This number is above 5. And since 30-4 =26, we will increase the number to 30, because of the small gap.


But what about the number 5? For all numbers what include 5, we round them up to the nearest 10.

(c):
Number = 25.
New number = 30 (after rounding).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Scientific notation or exponents deals with the simplification of very large or small numbers into easy to read ones. Often used a lot in sciences such as physics or in scientific math, scientific notation (referred to as exponents from here on in for naming conventions) can be used to describe the size of an electron, or the speed of light.

The speed of light in one such example is shown as:

3.0 x 10^8 or 3.0E8 Where 10^8 stands for 10 to the 8th exponent and 10E8 means the same.

The size of an electron could be described as this for an example:

3.45 x 10^-23 or 3.45E-23 Where 10^-23 means 10 to the -23 exponent (E the same), which is actually making it into a fraction, meaning that 3.45 x 10^-23 will be:

 &lt;math&gt;\frac{3.45}{100000000000000000000000}&lt;/math&gt;

I am awrare that this is a wikibook, but i still feel that as i am the major contributor, i should at least been consulted before adding things! And i am totally against the statement that articles should be started in the table of contentds.

This table of contents is not needed at all, the whole book is based on a table of contents!

I am really pissed off now!! --August 22:16, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

*'''First of all''' - calm down, relax, remember all, what I have wroted and think... And then (let's say after 2 days) if You will insist to remove that TOC, I will move it to my Sandbox. Ok?&lt;BR&gt;'''Second''' - If I need this type of TOC, maybe someone else will need? --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 13:45, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

**You should not tell me to calm down, as i think i acted as i should. This TOC only creates more work for us, and makes it more &quot;uneazy&quot; to browse the book. Only one toc is needed, and the whole book is boult around a toc! --August 23:40, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

*Sorry for some didactis, but seems You are overreacting... Why You can't realise, that 'toc_August_version' does not suit AndriuZ needs, so 'toc_AndriuZ_version' was created ? This did not corrupted Your's contributions to the book itself in any way. Whole Idea behind Wikipedia is cooperation of efforts. Your arguments are not accepted, because for me 'toc_August_version' not provides functions of TOC, just TOC_TOPICS... Put links 'next reading' on each page and will see... Maybe I'm oldfashioned, but according to [[w:Book]] and [[w:Table of contents]] is: ''an organized list of titles for '''quick''' information on the summary of a book or document and '''quickly directing''' the reader to '''any''' topic.'' I repeatedly ask You to provide more logic arguments (not emotions) - othervise I will ignore and if You want to make book for yourself - make it on Your '''own installation''' of Wiki... Sorry again. --[[User:AndriuZ|AndriuZ]] 09:07, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

**I have stopped contributing to this book now, as i cannot stand people like you doing very silly things to my book. Wiki is nothing for me, i guess. I will create another version of the book at mambosolutions.com instead, where i can control the content - so far other people have just added crap (exept for typo fixing), so i will just create it by myself there. --August 19:02, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

Thanks for the help.  I wasn't sure about the correct form.

Hey! Thanks for the note on my page, but I don't recall making a fuss about making biscuits. They ''are'' super easy. Better than making pancakes, imo. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:30, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

No problem! Good to see sparklin' new recipes! My blasted session timed out again... [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:47, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

== Jewish Recipes ==
I think &quot;Jewish cuisine&quot; would be an appropriate subsection of [[Cookbook:Cuisine]], though I'm sure there's some overlap into other regional cuisines. You may want to introduce regional sections or lineage sections underneath it, and crosslist common recipes and also crosslist the recipes when the coincide with normal regional cuisine (i.e. not entirely jewish-specific) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:24, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Too Old. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Too Old~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Weapon availability at ammunation ==

Weapons become available once you open up a new area of the game or complete a certain mission:

Country Rifle- Complete Body Harvest

Satchel Charges- Complete Against All Odds

Desert Eagle- Open Las Venturas

Combat Shotgun- Complete You've Had Your Chips

Sniper Rifle- Complete Snail Trail

Colt M4- Open the Dessert

AK-47- Open San Fierro

== Vertical bird mission ==

The right analog stick controls the position of the jets. Pushing forward rotates the jets so they point backwards. Pulling back rotates the jets so they point down. The former makes it behave more like a plane, and the latter makes it behave more like a helicopter.

For the first part (air-to-air combat), you probably want the former, for the second part (air-to-ground combat), you probably want the latter.

In both cases, try to get the target in view, press R1 to lock on. When the green crosshair turns red, press L1 to fire missiles.</text>

08.07.2004  Kiselyov Denis    
So you have decided to extort and establish CVS version Mambo 4.5.3 (upasi My God to do it without valerjanki, at me nerves strong it is simple)... 
What for this moment it is made by developers? 
And it is made here that... 
'Pluses: 
* multishablonnost, i.e. each basic section of the menu (category) can appoint the pattern. Not bad... But forces the designer to do patterns so that they corresponded to integrity of design as those... If patterns will collapse on color scale.. The Gloom will be... We Have: the majority of beginners mamberov is simple zabjut on this opportunity, and for the pro not sickly help... Fortunately it is possible to appoint one pattern for all sections. 
* There was a concept &quot;element&quot;, which in turn can include (and in a crowd) both components, and modules, both boats, and patterns. We have: for the user of convenience establishing an element well it is direct as in VIP hotel, for the developer the complicated architecture of creation installjatora, but it is that costs. 
* Creation of own fields of a conclusion of modules. I.e. them will be not 6 as was.. And the to appoint it is possible... Conveniently devilishly... We Have: at use of standard patterns this function simply disappears (admit fairly, not everyone are able to correct patterns, I speak about beginners), well and if handles primontirovany there where it is necessary SUCH it is possible to heap up! - Radely &quot;References&quot;, &quot;Announcements&quot; and &quot;Contacts&quot; now are not separate components and a part of kernel Mamby.. Though burst instead of you will cut out already...:i) 
* Internationalization is made very well, and... Now each of a site-aeeaa?ia has an opportunity to edit lokali manually from adminki! (mine regardy to developers!) 
Speed of generation of pages has essentially increased. It is connected with transition to a little bit other system of installation of parameters and a cutting of gathering of statistics on a site. We have: who on a hosting does not have administrator of the control panel a hosting with statistics fly by, at whom is.. Has carried... 

;Minuses: 

* And it is not realized up to the end krossbazovost. Support PostgreSQL till now in a condition of planning. That that I expected was not justified. True krossbazovosti do not wait... 
* Patterns are planned to moving to the catalogue of elements (imho: not the best decision, but we have centralization), the catalogue of elements will get the huge sizes at installation of a plenty of elements. 
* Now the pattern is added as an element, instead of simple copying in the necessary catalogue. To choose a pattern begins business gemmorojnym (I speak about a choice haljavnyh patterns when much and all would be desirable to look them in operation) 
* And it is not realized till now multi sajtovost and krossautentifikatsija. 

Perhaps while will suffice. It is a lot of defects, but I ask to consider, that it is just the CVS version... And up to bety it is still far. Three weeks. For three weeks much can happen.:i) 

But as a whole I am happy. Developers have made much. And still will make much.:i) 

N.B. Expected date of an output of the first bety Mambo 453 - the end of July, 2005.

__NOTOC__

[[File:Lasagna.jpg|thumb|Cooked lasagne on a plate.]]

'''Lasagna''' is a popular oven-baked pasta dish of fresh egg pasta squares. It is a traditional dish from Bologna in Northern Italy, where the sheets are always green through the addition of spinach or nettles to the egg dough. In Bologna, these home made sheets are layered with  small amounts of real Bolognese ragù (made with both beef and pork, very little tomato and no southern herbs like oregano and basil but a little nutmeg instead) and simialrly small amounts of  [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|&quot;besciamella&quot; ]] or béchamel sauce in an oven dish. There are at least 5 layers of pasta dough, and the layers stay separate and do not &quot;merge&quot; together into a mush. A light sprinkling of [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese| Parmigiano-Reggiano ]], and a few dabs of butter end the dish which is then baked for about half an hour. The use of [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|Mozzarella]] in place of Béchamel suggests a Neapolitan variation to the original Bologna classic, as does the use of Ricotta.

''Lasagne'' refers to multiple sheets of pasta; ''lasagna'' refers to the dish or to individual sheets of pasta.

In Italy but especially outside, many lasagna variations exist today. Vegetable lasagna, lasagna without béchamel sauce, lasagna without any sauce (just vegetables and/or meat) or even lasagna without sheets of pasta.

When assembling a lasagna, start with the main ingredient (ragu, vegetables, seafood, etc.), add a layer of béchamel sauce, then one layer of lasagne pasta sheets and then the main ingredient again. Continue until the oven dish is full. End with a layer of pasta, spread some béchamel sauce on top and sprinkle the cheese over it. 

== The Pasta ==
When it comes to the pasta dough there is, as always, a choice between home-made pasta and store bought sheets of dried pasta. Since dried pasta is made with just water and flour and home made fresh pasta usually includes eggs, there is a distinct difference in flavour and texture. The main difference, however, comes from ease of use. Making pasta from scratch can be a lengthy process and takes some practice to get it right. See the [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]] page for a fresh pasta recipe.

Dried pasta is usually precooked, so it can be put in to the oven dish straight out of the packet. 

In the US, pasta sheets generally have a curvy surface. Outside the US, they are almost always flat. 

Apart from the plain lasagne sheets, the green ones that Bologna favours are also common. These are called ''lasagne verdi'' and are flavored with spinach. They work well with white sauces ([[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|bechamels]] or cream-based sauces and seafood.

== General Guidelines for making Lasagna ==

* Most packaged lasagna need to cook in a preheated oven for 30 to 50 minutes (based on the size) at gas mark 4 (350°F/180°C).

== Notes, Tips &amp; Variations ==

* Some recipes call for the béchamel sauce to be mixed through the ragu or tomato sauce, while others tell you to layer it between the pasta and the ragu. This seems to be based on personal preference and taste.
* Besides sprinkling cheese on top of the lasagna, it's also a good idea to mix some through the béchamel sauce, to give the lasagna some cheese flavor throughout, instead of just on top. Turn the heat off under the béchamel sauce before adding the cheese, or the sauce will become rubbery.
* A [[Cookbook:Moussaka|Moussaka]] is essentially a lasagna with slices of eggplant instead of pasta.
* A [[Cookbook:Pasta Casserole (Pastitsio)|Pastitsio]], or Greek Lasagna, is a Greek casserole like lasagna where the ragu is combined with tubular pasta, and topped with a [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|béchamel sauce]].
* A [[Cookbook:Scacchi|Scacchi]] or ''mina'' is a lasagna-like dish made during Passover by some Italian and Sephardic Jews, using broth or water-soaked matzo as the starch layer and generally containing ground beef or lamb, spinach or other greens, and other vegetables as ingredients.

Hey, I'd like you to have a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]] and consider giving this course a hierarchy. At the moment it's entirely up to you to show readers what the parent of a page is. And doing it the way you are now you're eventually going to run into conflicts with existing books/pages' names.

Anyway, hope that helps! :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:24, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Order of Operations in math is dealing with the order in which you work out an equation, which can solve many problems.

For example:

2 x 3 + 5 = x

In this example, what is x?
We could either multiply 2 by 3, then add 5 to it OR we could add 3 and 5 together and multiply that by two. But how do we know?

Using BODMAS we can. BODMAS stands for Brackets Over Division Multiplication Addition Subtraction. This is the order we go in.

So using BODMAS we will multiply first and then add. So it is really:

(2x3) + 5 = x
x = 11

Order of operation is also inportant in boolean algebra (see: Boolean Algebra). When a problem needs to be solved, it can be turned into BODMAS form to solve it. For example:

1 AND 1 OR 0 NAND 1. How would this work? If we convert it, it is:

1x1+0x1'= x 

So we would go for multiplication first, 
1x1 = 1. 

so it is now:

1+0x1'=x

We do multiplication again:
0x1 = 0, but because this is the inverse, we make it 1.

So it is now:
1+1 = 2 (or in this case 1, because it is OR).

And our problem gets solved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Decimals (or floating point numbers) are the oposite of fractions, where fractions take the form of a number over a number eg:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; which is one half.

In decimal format this would be 0.5. Why?

Well one half of 1 is 0.5 since 0.5 * 2 is equal to 1. If we multiply the number at the bottom by the decimal we should get the number at the top. Such as:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; Is still one half.  
&lt;math&gt;2/4 = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 0.5*4 = 2&lt;/math&gt;

So the formulae could be: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}=x&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;x*b = a&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Measurement in math is the act of finding the length, width, height etc... of a certain object, different measurement schemes are used for different objects.

eg:

Centimetres for small shapes, 
Square centimetres for area
Centimetres cubed for volume.

There are different ways of measuring geometric shapes, depending on the dimentional qualities of them.
For example, measuring a line ----- long, you could count how many dashes there are, and call it 5 dashes long, or you could measure it with a ruler.

But for something like:

  -------
  I     I
  I     I
  -------

You would first use the formula for Area to get the inside size, or use the formula for perimeter.
A=LW for a square,
So Area = Length * Width

So as &lt;math&gt;4 * 7 = 28cm^2&lt;/math&gt;

Which is 28cm squared

For perimeter in a square, you take each side and add them together.
So &lt;math&gt;4 + 4 + 7 + 7= 2*4 + 2*7 = 8 + 14 = 22&lt;/math&gt;

* &amp;frac14; cup plus 2 tablespoons spiced [[Cookbook:Rum|rum]]  
* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] 
* 2 cups [[cookbook:Cream|whipping cream]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla Extract|vanilla extract]]
* 5 tablespoons [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 16 oz loaf of [[cookbook:Baguette|French bread]] or other non-sour white [[cookbook:bread|bread]] (stale bread is traditionally used)
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]  
* 3 [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]]  

==Procedure==
# In a cup or other small container, add 2 tablespoons of rum to the chocolate chips and soak them until they are needed in step 9
# In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, whipping cream, vanilla extract, &amp;frac14; cup rum and 3 tablespoons sugar.
# Slice the bread, trim off the crusts and cut it into strips. divide the bread strips into three parts.
# Butter a loaf pan
# Peel the bananas, cut them in half crosswise and then lengthwise
# In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and add the banana pieces with 2 tablespoons of sugar. cook 2 minutes, then flip the bananas over and cook the other side for 2 minutes.
# Cover the bottom of the loaf pan with bread strips (use 1/3 of the bread strips for this)
# Spread half of the banana pieces on top of the layer of bread strips
# Spread half of the chocolate chips on top of the bananas
# Add another layer of bread strips
# Pour half of the egg mix into the loaf pan and let it soak in for a minute.
# Add the rest of the bananas, then the rest of the chocolate chips, then the rest of the bread strips. pour the rest of the egg mixture on top
# Let the loaf pan sit for about 15 minutes while preheating the oven to 350&amp;deg;F
# Bake for 50 minutes. let cool for 10-15 minutes

Serve with Rum Sauce, whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

Portuguese alphabet, like in other [[w:Romance languages|Romance languages]] has a natural evolution from latin and so it is not strictly phonetic and has some features inheirited from its history. Although, compared to English or even French it is easy to read and not so hard to write. 

==Letters==

The sounds are better explained in the next chapters.

Cooked according to classic preparation rules, Tafelspitz (literally translated: the point of the table) is known to have been Austrian Hungarian Emperor Francis Joseph's favourite meal. Viennese “Tafelspitz” for Austrians is not only a way to boil beef, but is a whole special culinary science prepared with a special cut of beef. It is not a pot roast. The authentic Tafelspitz requires a custom-cut fresh piece of the hind part of beef (comparable to the American tri tip, also called silver tip); on the North American market, a substitute can be fresh beef chuck brisket (not corned brisket).

The secrets of a juicy Tafelspitz are: heating the water to a rolling boil before the piece of meat is put in the water; the sudden sealing of the meat’s juices as soon as the meat’s pores close when the Tafelspitz touches the boiling water; not too much salt, but enough to enhance the meat’s flavour; a few pieces of vegetables (sometimes also sections of bones with marrow), the right cooking time, and the gentle rolling of the boiling water which will cook but not break the meat’s fibre. This recipe is a simplified version of this very Austrian dish.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 ½ pounds (1200g) of either fresh beef brisket, silverside or sirloin-enough water for your suitable Dutch oven pot (about 5 Qt. (700ml) Pot capacity with about 4 Qts. (560ml) Of water) + salt (about ½ tablespoon for every Qt. Of water).
* 3 whole cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], slightly crushed, peeled.
* 3 whole green (freeze dried) or white [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorns]].
* 2 [[Cookbook:Juniper Berry|juniper berries]] (you may substitute with 1 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]]).
* 3 whole medium size [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], peeled, trimmed (about 4 oz. [110g)]).
* 1 small-medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], trimmed, unpeeled, halved (about 2 oz [55g]).
* 3 sprigs fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]].

== Procedure ==
# In a suitable covered Dutch oven, bring water to a rolling boil over medium heat.
#When the water boils, add meat, garlic, peppercorns, juniper berries, and cover.
# Bring the water to a boil again and add carrots, onion, and parsley.
#Cover and let everything simmer for 60 minutes.
#Turn the meat over, add salt, and let everything cook, covered, for 90 additional minutes.
# Switch off the heat and let the meat steep for 20 minutes.
#Remove the meat from the broth and cut meat across the grain when you serve it.

Serve Tafelspitz with “Apfelkren” and your choice of raw and cooked vegetables.

Note :Keep the broth for soups. Cut cold meat leftovers in thin strips and use like a meat salad mixed with raw sliced onions dressed with a simple oil, vinegar, salt and pepper vinaigrette.

How to make “Apfelkren” (apple horseradish sauce) for Tafelspitz:  Combine and blend 1 pound Golden Delicious apples, cored, peeled, grated and cooked until very mushy with 1 tablespoon wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 3 tablespoons prepared horseradish.

Bobcats are actually a ''type'' of Lynx, so all this information on them being &quot;different&quot; is false. See the [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568386/Lynx.html Encarta article]. --[[User:Munchkinguy|Munchkinguy]] 02:45, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

Changed it around a bit, making it clear that bobcats are a kind of lynx. I messed up the layout slightly, but I feel the image I added shows the face of a lynx beautifully. I went and called the ''Lynx Lynx'' and ''Lynx Canadensis'' just plain Lynx, since they are very similar in the first place. Not the best of edits, but I feel it was a step in the right direction. --[[User:BCalchet|BCalchet]] 04:02, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the interview section, or perhaps just content for the Big Cats issue, I am planning to attempt to solicit an interview with someone at [http://www.livingdesert.org/ The Living Desert Zoo and Gardens] here in the Palm Springs, CA area.

They have one or more:
Bobcat 
Caracal 
Cheetah 
Leopard
Ocelot 
Puma
Serval

==My Questions for you here==
*How should I deal with this?  I am thinking of introducing myself as &quot;Mike Graham with (or maybe ''from'') the WikiMedia Foundation,&quot; which has an air of legitamacy to it.  I hope introducing myself as such would not be to presumptuous.

*I should also probably give myself a title.  Contributor sounds a little too informal, it seems to me.  Would calling myself a writer for the Foundation be going to far?

:I think either contributor or volunteer sound general enough that they leave a lot of room for interpretation, especially volunteer since you are representing a foundation.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 22:10, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

*Are there any matters of interview etiquitte I should be aware of?  Also, how should I dress?  (Note: it is very hot here, I'm talking in excess of 110 degrees.  I suspect this might be an outdoor, touring interview.  At least that's what I'd like, and I think that might be most productive.

:The most important rule I've heard isn't ettiquitte: Never ask a question that can be answered with a yes or no.  Rephrasing such a question will get you way more information.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 22:10, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

==My Questions for who I talk to==
::Post suggestions here for questions, or other suggestions.  I'll post more details about who I will be interviewing (assuming I will be interviewing somoene) when I get information.

These are the kinds of things I think kids would ask:
*What do you feed your cats and how much do they eat?
*Which of your cats are considered the most dangerous?
*How do the cats get exercise in the zoo?
*What types of toys do they have / particularly enjoy?
*Where do you get your big cats?
*How do you keep them from escaping?
*What kind of special care do cubs born in the zoo require?

I might also ask 
*What are the biggest problems zoos face in caring for big cats?
*What question do you wish more people would ask?

This is definitely something where input from someone with a classroom full of our target age would be really helpful.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 22:19, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

:Also if the [[Wikijunior Big Cats/Tigons and Ligers]] is staying, you probably want to ask about Tiger and Lion hybridization in zoos and the ethics of it.  --[[User:Laurascudder|Laura Scudder]] | [[User talk:Laurascudder|Talk]] 22:21, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

*GCC
*Makefiles
*Tarballs
*Bash Scripts
*Free Software Licences
*Packaging Systems (e.g. deb)
*Versioning Systems (e.g. CVS, Subversion)


== Free Software Licences ==

Due to Linux's origins you will find that a lot of packages available for it
use various types of free licenses. It is important that you pay attention 
to these if you are going to be using the code for any further development.


== Tarballs ==

A term referring to a package stored as a file with the extension tar.gz 
these are often used for distributing source files. They perform a similar 
function to a zip file.

==Makefiles==
A text file used by the make program to create a program. The script used to make a program uses the form
 program : codefiles
  command to build

The script
 clean:
   rm -f objectfiles program
tells make what to delete when the command &lt;tt&gt;make clean&lt;/tt&gt; is invoked.

== Versioning Systems ==

In open development processes many people may be working on the same codebase.
To ease the complexity of co-ordinating development the code is sometimes stored 
in a versioning system. This usually consists of a central repository where developers 
can &quot;check out&quot; (like you check a book out of a library) pieces of code to work on
they then work on it and their changes are merged back in when they have finished.

----

In set theory you can specify a set by naming the elements of a set (say &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) and giving constraints on them (say &lt;math&gt;cond(a)&lt;/math&gt;): &lt;math&gt; \{a | cond(a) \} &lt;/math&gt;.

Now try to construct the set of all sets that do not contain themselves in the above notation. If it were to exist, all sets should be unambigously elements of that set or not. Otherwise a contradiction would result. Which set would be most worthwhile to consider?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy of consciousness==

The nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed a confident use of nineteenth century scientific ideas amongst philosophers of mind and a few philosophers such as Whitehead were also coming to terms with modern science.

==ER Clay==
ER Clay deserves a mention in the catalogue of important nineteenth century philosophers of consciousness for the quotation from his work given in William James' classic text ''The Principles of Psychology'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relation of experience to time has not been profoundly studied. Its objects are given as being of the present, but the part of time referred to by the datum is a very different thing from the conterminous of the past and future which philosophy denotes by the name Present. The present to which the datum refers is really a part of the past -- a recent past -- delusively given as being a time that intervenes between the past and the future. Let it be named the specious present, and let the past, that is given as being the past, be known as the obvious past. All the notes of a bar of a song seem to the listener to be contained in the present. All the changes of place of a meteor seem to the beholder to be contained in the present. At the instant of the termination of such series, no part of the time measured by them seems to be a past. Time, then, considered relatively to human apprehension, consists of four parts, viz., the obvious past, the specious present, the real present, and the future. Omitting the specious present, it consists of three . . . nonentities -- the past, which does not exist, the future, which does not exist, and their conterminous, the present; the faculty from which it proceeds lies to us in the fiction of the specious present.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clay provides an eloquent description of the extended, or ''specious'', present, mentioning both the way that consciousness seems to occupy a duration of time and the way that events within conscious experience have their own durations so that they snap out of existence when they end. This description in itself allows us to see how McTaggart's &quot;A Series&quot; might be constructed from the overlapping extended present's of events.

Clay's use of the pejorative term &quot;specious&quot; for the way that experience has a duration was necessary in the nineteenth century but now we know that it was the nineteenth century idea of physical time that was specious. A neutral term for experience laid out in time might be the &quot;extended present&quot;.

==Alfred North Whitehead==

[http://spartan.ac.brocku.ca/~lward/Whitehead/Whitehead_1920/White1_01.html The Concept of Nature. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1920): 49-73.]

Many twentieth century philosophers have taken the nineteenth century idea of space and time as the framework within which their descriptions of experience are elaborated. Whitehead was a mathematician and philosopher who understood the limitations of this framework and pointed out that our failure to understand and overcome these limitations was probably at the root of our failure to understand consciousness. He traces the problem to the nineteenth century view of time and space and rails against materialists who elevate nineteenth century scientific doctrine above observational and scientific reality.  

He also believed that mind and nature are part of the same phenomena:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What I am essentially protesting against is the bifurcation of nature into two systems of reality, which, in so far as they are real, are real in different senses. One reality would be the entities such as electrons which are the study of speculative physics. This would be the reality which is there for knowledge; although on this theory it is never known. For what is known is the other sort of reality, which is the byplay of the mind. Thus there would be two natures, one is the conjecture and the other is the dream.

Another way of phrasing this theory which I am arguing against is to bifurcate nature into two divisions, (31) namely into the nature apprehended in awareness and the nature which is the cause of awareness. The nature which is the fact apprehended in awareness holds within it the greenness of the trees, the song of the birds, the warmth of the sun, the hardness of the chairs, and the feel of the velvet. The nature which is the cause of awareness is the conjectured system of molecules and electrons which so affects the mind as to produce the awareness of apparent nature. The meeting point of these two natures is the mind, the causal nature being influent and the apparent nature being effluent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He argued that science is about the relations between things:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The understanding which is sought by science is an understanding of relations within nature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whitehead was aware of the way that the simultaneity of events is of crucial importance to phenomenal experience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general fact is the whole simultaneous occurrence of nature which is now for sense-awareness. This general fact is what I have called the discernible. But in future I will call it a 'duration,' meaning thereby a certain whole of nature which is limited only by the property of being a simultaneity. Further in obedience to the principle of comprising within nature the whole terminus of sense-awareness, simultaneity must not be conceived as an irrelevant mental concept imposed upon nature. Our sense-awareness posits for immediate discernment a certain whole, here called a 'duration'; thus a duration is a definite natural entity. A duration is discriminated as a complex of partial events, and the natural entities which are components of this complex are thereby said to be 'simultaneous with this duration.' Also in a derivative sense they are simultaneous with each other in respect to this duration. Thus simultaneity is a definite natural relation. The word' duration' is perhaps unfortunate in so far as it suggests a mere abstract stretch of time. This is not what I mean. A duration is a concrete slab of nature limited by simultaneity which is an essential factor disclosed in sense-awareness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whitehead also stresses the role of the extended, or 'specious', present in sense awareness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is important to distinguish simultaneity from instantaneousness. I lay no stress on the mere current usage of the two terms. There are two concepts which I want to distinguish, and one I call simultaneity and the other instantaneousness. I hope that the words are judiciously chosen; but it really does not matter so long as I succeed in explaining my meaning. Simultaneity is the property of a group of natural elements which in some sense are components of a duration. A duration can be all nature present as the immediate fact posited by sense-awareness. A duration retains within itself the passage of nature. There are within it antecedents and consequents which are also durations which may be the complete specious presents of quicker consciousnesses. In other words a duration retains temporal thickness. Any concept of all nature as immediately known is always a concept of some duration though it may be enlarged in its temporal thickness beyond the possible specious present of any being known to us as existing within nature. Thus simultaneity is an ultimate factor in nature, immediate for sense-awareness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So a set of events that are extended in time constitutes conscious experience. He then defines continuity in terms of overlapping durations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The continuity of nature arises from extension. Every event extends over other events, and every event is extended over by other events. Thus in the special case of durations which are now the only events directly under consideration, every duration is part of other durations; and every duration has other durations which are parts of it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That experience exists as whole durations that overlap means that the overlapping durations can be considered to be composed of moments or instants and these can be assigned to a series which we call 'time':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such an ordered series of moments is what we mean by time defined as a series. Each element of the series exhibits an instantaneous; state of nature, Evidently this serial time is the result of an intellectual process of (65) abstraction.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Processes can occur within a duration of sense awareness so things can change within the extended present of a conscious interval.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sense-awareness and thought are themselves processes as well as their termini in nature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So Whitehead's durations of sense awareness both contain processes and are phenomena in their own right.  A movement can be both a succession of changes of position and a quality of motion over the whole duration that contains it.

One disturbing feature of his analysis is that he does not mention the way that durations are attached to events; Clay states that the extension in time of an event disappears when the event ceases.

&lt;!-- this paragraph needs a reference and quotation 
Whitehead recognised a possible problem with Aristotle's system of categories. Whitehead suggested substituting his category of relation for Aristotle's category of substance, giving us a different conception of being. This allowed Whitehead to postulate a conception of consciousness that avoided an infinite regress and the need for accounting for awareness as a product of our physical senses. Thus, a different approach was recognized, one that rivalled the post-Cartesian approach to understanding the world. It is Whitehead's encounter with Aristotle that allowed him to formulate a different possible solution to the problem of consciousness and one that falls squarely in the domain of panpsychism.--&gt;

==Edmund Husserl==

Husserl has been influential in postmodern philosophy. He writes in a slightly obscure style that has been adopted by many European philosophers, an example of this almost post-modern style is given below:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The genuine intentional synthesis is discovered in the synthesis of several acts into one act, such that, in a unique manner of binding one meaning to another, there emerges not merely a whole, an amalgam whose parts are meanings, but rather a single meaning in which these meanings themselves are contained, but in a meaningful way. With this the problems of correlation, too, already announce themselves; and thus, in fact, this work contains the first, though of course very imperfect, beginnings of &quot;phenomenology.&quot;&quot; (Husserl 1937).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Husserl seems to be largely a Humean in the sense that he gives precedence to mental experience as the only thing that may be known directly and hence certainly. He regards the components of experience as part of consciousness, so the intention to move, the movement and the sensation of movement are bound or 'bracketed' together into a single meaning. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In my perceptual field I find myself holding sway as ego through my organs and generally through everything belonging to me as an ego in my ego-acts and faculties. However, though the objects of the life-world, if they are to show their very own being, necessarily show themselves as physical bodies, this does not mean that they show themselves only in this way; and [similarly] we, though we are related through the living body to all objects which exist for us, are not related to them solely as a living body. Thus if it is a question of objects in the perceptual field, we are perceptually also in the field; and the same is true, in modification, of every intuitive field, and even of every nonintuitive one, since we are obviously capable of &quot;representing&quot; to ourselves everything which is non-intuitively before us (though we are sometimes temporally limited in this). [Being related] &quot;through the living body&quot; clearly does not mean merely [being related] &quot;as a physical body&quot;; rather, the expression refers to the kinesthetic, to functioning as an ego in this peculiar way, primarily through seeing, hearing, etc.; and of course other modes of the ego belong to this (for example, lifting, carrying, pushing, and the like).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should be noted that Husserl believes we ''perform'' acts of perception and that we should refrain from judgement about where the things in perception are located or their nature. This suspension of judgement is called ''epoche'' and derives from ancient Greek skepticism.

Husserl seems to share Locke's view that experience is extended in time. He is obscure about whether he believes consciousness itself is a process that initiates action. He uses a linguistic argument to justify the idea of consciousness as a form of action:

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Whatever becomes accessible to us through reflection has a noteworthy universal character: that of being consciousness of something, of having something as an object of consciousness, or correlatively, to be aware of it we are speaking here of intentionality. This is the essential character of mental life in the full sense of the word, and is thus simply inseparable from it. It is, for example, inseparable from the perceiving that reflection reveals to us, that it is of this or that; just as the process of remembering is, in itself, remembering or recalling of this or that; just as thinking is thinking of this or that thought, fearing is of something, love is of something; and so on. We can also bring in here the language we use in speaking of appearing or having something appear.&quot;(Husserl 1928)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Intentionality is a process and Husserl seems to be suggesting that consciousness is a process:

&lt;blockquote&gt;5. The Purely Mental in Experience of the Self and of Community. The All-Embracing Description of Intentional Processes. (Husserl 1928)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

then, not surprisingly, fails to find any processes within it and changes his view of consciousness to that of observation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... But I &lt;must&gt; immediately add that the universality of the phenomenological epoche as practiced by the phenomenologist from the very beginning the universality in which he or she becomes the mere impartial observer of the totality of his conscious life-process brings about not only a thematic purification of the individual processes of consciousness and thereby discloses its noematic components; (Husserl 1928)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He calls the contents of perception the perceptual ''noema''. Husserl seems to be aware of the problem of the extended present:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How can we account for the fact that a presently occurring experience in one's consciousness called &quot;recollection&quot; makes us conscious of a not-present event and indeed makes us aware of it as past? And how is it that in the &quot;remembered&quot; moment, that sense can be included in an evidential way with the sense: &quot;have earlier perceived&quot;? How are we to understand the fact that a perceptual, that is to say, bodily characterized present can at the same time contain a co-presence with the sense of a perceivability that goes beyond the &lt;immediate&gt; perceivedness? How are we to understand the fact that the actual perceptual present as a totality does not close out the world but rather always carries within itself the sense of an infinite plus ultra &lt;more beyond&gt;?&quot;(Husserl 1928)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But is vague about whether mental time is a continuum or has three components of remembered past, present and some sort of intuition of the future. His rejection of the possibility of describing the mind through the spatio-temporal models of the physical sciences limits his interpretation of mental space and time.

==Gilbert Ryle 1900-1976==

Gilbert Ryle is famous for his &quot;logical behaviourism&quot;.  He was Waynflete Professor of metaphysical philosophy at Oxford and amongst his eminent students are Daniel C Dennett and David Armstrong.  Dennett wrote the Introduction to the Penguin edition of &quot;Concept of Mind&quot;.

===The Concept of Mind. First published by Hutchinson 1949. Published by Penguin Classics, Penguin Books, Chippenham, England.===

Ryle begins the Concept of Mind by proposing that there is an &quot;official doctrine&quot; of mind due to Descartes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The official doctrine, which hails chiefly from Descartes, is something like this.  With the doubtful exception of idiots and infants in arms every human being has both a body and a mind. Some would prefer to say that every human being is both a body and a mind. His body and his mind are ordinarily harnessed together, but after the death of the body his mind may continue to exist and function.

Human bodies are in space and are subject to the mechanical laws which govern all other bodies in space. ....

But minds are not in space, nor are their operations subject to mechanical laws.  The workings of one mind are not witnessable by other observers; its career is private.  Only I can take cognisance of the states and processes of my own mind.Chapter 1, p13.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Ryle considers that the &quot;official doctrine&quot; is absurd:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such in outline is the official theory. I shall speak of it, with deliberate abusiveness, as 'dogma of the ghost in the machine'. Chapter 1, p17.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

He considers that the &quot;official theory&quot; is due to a particular mistake that he calls a &quot;category mistake&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I must first indicate what is meant by the phrase 'Category mistake'.  This I do in a series of illustrations.
A foreigner visiting Oxford or Cambridge for the first time is shown a number of colleges, libraries, playing fields, museums,scientific departments and administrative offices. He then asks 'But where is the university? I have seen where the members of the Colleges live, where the Registrar works, where the scientists experiment and the rest. But I have not yet seen the university in which reside and work the members of your University.'  It has then to be explained to him that the University is not another collateral institution, some ulterior counterpart to the colleges, laboratories and offices which he has seen.  The university is just the way in which all that he has already seen is organized.    ....

My destructive purpose is to show that a family of radical category mistakes is the origin of the double-life theory.  The representation of a person as a ghost mysteriously ensconced in a machine derives from this argument.  Because, as is true, a person's thinking, feeling and purposive doing cannot be described solely in the idioms of physics, chemistry and physiology, therefore they must be described in counterpart idioms.  As the human body is a complex organised unit, so the human mind must be another complex organized unit, though one made of a different sort of stuff and with a different sort of structure.  Or, again, as the human body, like any other parcel of matter, is a field of causes and effects, so the mind must be another field of causes and effects, though not (Heaven be praised) mechanical causes and effects. Chapter 1, p 19-20.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Note that Ryle is still ridiculing the &quot;official theory&quot; in his description of the category mistake given above.  Ryle's style frequently makes it difficult to isolate his own proposals from the mockery of the proposals of his imagined rivals.

Ryle continues his attack on the &quot;official doctrine&quot; and considers that the ancient Greeks believed that the theorizing or intelligent part of the person was the mind:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...both philosophers and laymen tend to treat intellectual operations as the core of mental conduct; that is to say, they tend to define all other mental conduct-concepts in terms of concepts of cognition. They suppose that the primary exercise of minds consists in finding the answers to questions and that their other occupations are merely applications of considered truths or even regrettable distractions from their consideration. The Greek idea that immortality is reserved for the theorizing part of the soul was discredited, but not dispelled, by Christianity. Chapter 2. p27&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

He then attempts to dispel this &quot;intellectualist legend&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The crucial objection to the intellectualist legend is this. The consideration of propositions is itself an operation the execution of which can be more of less intelligent, less or more stupid.  But if, for any operation to be intelligently executed, a prior theoretical operation had first to be performed and performed intelligently, it would be a logical impossibility for anyone ever to break into the circle.

Let us consider some salient points at which this regress would arise.  According to the legend, whenever an agent does anything intelligently, his act is preceded and steered by another internal act of considering a regulative proposition appropriate to his practical problem.  But what makes him consider the one maxim which is appropriate rather than any of the thousands which are not? Why does the hero not find himself calling to mind a cooking recipe, or a rule of Formal Logic? Perhaps he does but then his intellectual process is silly and not sensible.  Intelligently reflecting how to act is, among other things, considering what is pertinent and disregarding what is inappropriate.  Must we then say that for the hero's reflections how to act to be intelligent he must first reflect how best to reflect how to act? The endlessness of this implied regress shows that the application of the criteria of appropriateness does not entail the occurrence of a process of considering this criterion.  Chapter 2, p31.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the famous &quot;Ryle's Regress&quot;.

Ryle considers that when people use the term &quot;in the mind&quot; they actually mean &quot;in their heads&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When people employ the idiom 'in the mind', they are usually expressing over-sophisticatedly what we ordinarily express by the less misleading metaphorical use of 'in the head'. Chapter 2. p 40.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ryle is utterly against the concept of conscious emulation or simulation of the world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The statement 'the mind is its own place', as theorists might construe it, is not true, for the mind is not even a metaphorical 'place'.  On the contrary, the chessboard, the platform, the scholar's desk, the judge's bench, the lorry-driver's seat, the studio and the football field are among its places.  These are where people work and play stupidly or intelligently. 'Mind' is not the name of another place where work is done or games are played; and it is not the name of another tool with which work is done, or another appliance with which games are played. Chapter 2, p50.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Ryle has an implicitly endurantist idea of time in which introspection can only occur as successions of events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would be admitted that only people with a special training ever speak of 'introspecting', but in such phrases as 'he caught himself wondering how to do so and so', or 'when I catch myself getting into a panic, I do such and such', the plain man is expressing at least part of what is meant by the word.

Now supposing (which it is the negative object of this book to deny), that there did exist events of the postulated ghostly status, there would still be objections to the initially plausible assumption that there also exists a species of perception capable of having any of these events for its proprietory objects.For one thing, the occurrence of such an act of inner perception would require that the observer could attend to two things at the same time. He would, for example, be both resolving to get up early and concomitantly observing his act of resolving; attending to the program of rising betimes and perpetually attending to his attending to this program. Chapter 6, p157-158.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

For Ryle things are known after the instant when they occur, he ignores any idea of the specious present:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If retrospection can give us the data we need for some states of mind, there is no reason why it should not do so for all. And this is just what seems to be suggested by the popular phrase 'to catch oneself doing so and so'.  We catch, as we pursue and overtake, what is already running away from us.  I catch myself daydreaming about a mountain walk after, perhaps very shortly after, I have begun the daydream; or I catch myself humming a particular air only when the first few notes have already been hummed.  Retrospection, prompt or delayed, is a genuine process and one which is exempt from the troubles ensuing from the assumption of multiply divided attention; .. Chapter 6, p159.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The basis for much of Ryle's philosophy in Concept of Mind is Aristotle's regress which he interprets in an endurantist fashion as meaning that there can be no internal mind.  He considers observing a robin and says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If sensations are proper objects of observation, then observing them must carry with it the having of sensations of those sensations analogous to the glimpses of the robin without which I could not be watching the robin. And this is clearly absurd.  There is nothing answering to the phrases 'a glimpse of a glimpse' or a 'whiff of a pain' or 'the sound of a tweak' or 'the tingle of a tingle', and if there ever was anything to correspond, the series would go on forever. Chapter 8, p197.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

Indeed, Ryle's philosophy is entirely the consequences of the acceptance of Aristotle's regress as an absolute constraint, it being assumed that there is no further physical theory available to explain mind or behaviour.

== Daniel Clement Dennett (1942 -) ==

[[Image:Dan_Dennett_in_Tahiti.jpg|thumb|left|Dennett (photo: Hayford Peirce)]]Dennett is well known for his &quot;Multiple Drafts Model&quot; of consciousness. The Multiple Drafts Theory or Model of Consciousness is a theory of consciousness based upon the proposal that the brain acts as an information processor. The Theory is described in depth in the book Consciousness Explained, written by Dennett in 1991. It proposes a form of strong AI.

Dennett describes his theory (CE p117) as '''operationalist''', as Dennett says: &quot;There is no reality of conscious experience independent of the effects of various vehicles of content on subsequent action (and hence, of course, on memory).&quot; (Not to be confused with 'instrumentalism').

Dennett's starting point in the development of the Multiple Drafts theory is a description of the phi illusion. In this experiment two different coloured lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore the light seems to change colour as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change colour before the second light is observed.

An example of the phi illusion in the format described by Dennett is shown here: [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lka/handle.exe phi illusion] (use the 'test' option to select the simple phi demonstration).

Dennett explains the change of colour of the light in terms of either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses. In the Orwellian hypothesis the subject develops a narrative about the movement of the lights after the event. In the Stalinesque hypothesis the subject's brain would have a delay in which the movement of the green light towards the red light could be modelled after the sensory information from the red light had been received. He then says that it does not matter which hypothesis applies because: &quot;the Multiple Drafts model goes on to claim that the brain does not bother 'constructing' any representations that go to the trouble of 'filling in' the blanks. That would be a waste of time and (shall we say?) paint. The judgement is already in so we can get on with other tasks!&quot; 

It should be pointed out that fMRI studies by Larsen ''et al.'' 2006 have shown that the brain does indeed fill in the blanks during the phi illusion and Blankenburg ''et al.'' 2006 have shown that the brain fills in the blanks during the cutaneous rabbit illusion so Dennett's primary proposal is now known to be incorrect. The brain uses the Stalinesque paradigm - it models events during a delay.

According to the Multiple Drafts theory there are a variety of sensory inputs from a given event and also a variety of interpretations of these inputs. The sensory inputs arrive in the brain and are interpreted at different times so a given event can give rise to a succession of discriminations. As soon as each discrimination is accomplished it becomes available for eliciting a behaviour. A wide range of behaviours may occur ranging from reactions to the event such as running away to descriptions of the experience of the event etc.

At different times after the event a person is able to relate different stories of what happened depending upon the extent to which the event has been analysed. Dennett compares this with a 'Cartesian Theatre' model of consciousness in which events suddenly appear on some sort of mental screen and then disappear as quickly. He provides numerous examples to show that events are analysed over a period of time rather than instantaneously.

Although Multiple Drafts is described as a model or theory of consciousness that differs from other models, Dennett points out that even Descartes was aware that reactions to an event could occur over a period of time with reflexes occurring first and judgements later. What makes Multiple Drafts different is that Dennett, in different sections of Consciousness Explained, either denies that normal conscious experiences actually occur or describes these as emerging in some unspecified way from the sheer complexity of information processing in the brain. His emergentism is clear when he defends the Multiple Drafts Model from Searle's Chinese room argument by saying of the critics: They just can't imagine how understanding could be a property that emerges from lots of distributed quasi-understanding in a large system (CE p439).

As an example of an apparent denial of conscious experience Dennett denies that there is any internal experience of colour, instead he says that qualia in general are &quot;mechanically accomplished dispositions to react&quot;. This view originates in Dennett's belief in the method of heterophenomenology in which narrative is thought to be the most crucial tool for investigating consciousness. However, Dennett does not actually deny conscious experience but he does deny ''internal'' conscious experience (see below).

The origin of this operationalist approach can be seen in Dennett's immediately earlier work. Dennett (1988) redefines consciousness in terms of access consciousness alone, he argues that &quot;Everything real has properties, and since I don't deny the reality of conscious experience, I grant that conscious experience has properties&quot;. Having related all consciousness to properties he then declares that these properties are actually judgements of properties. He considers judgements of the properties of consciousness to be identical to the properties themselves. He writes:

&quot;The infallibilist line on qualia treats them as properties of one's experience one cannot in principle misdiscover, and this is a mysterious doctrine (at least as mysterious as papal infal libility) unless we shift the emphasis a little and treat qualia as logical constructs out of subjects' qualia-judgments: a subject's experience has the quale F if and only if the subject judges his experience to have quale F.&quot;

Having identified &quot;properties&quot; with &quot;judgement of properties&quot; he can then show that the judgements are insubstantial, hence the properties are insubstantial and hence the qualia are insubstantial or even non-existent. Dennett concludes that qualia can be rejected as non-existent:

&quot;So when we look one last time at our original characterization of qualia, as ineffable, intrinsic, private, directly apprehensible properties of experience, we find that there is nothing to fill the bill. In their place are relatively or practically ineffable public properties we can refer to indirectly via reference to our private property-detectors-- private only in the sense of idiosyncratic. And insofar as we wish to cling to our subjective authority about the occurrence within us of states of certain types or with certain properties, we can have some authority--not infallibility or incorrigibility, but something better than sheer guessing--but only if we restrict ourselves to relational, extrinsic properties like the power of certain internal states of ours to provoke acts of apparent re- identification. So contrary to what seems obvious at first blush, there simply are no qualia at all. &quot; (Dennett 1988)

This identification of qualia with judgements rather than experience is the key to the Multiple Drafts Model, once accepted there is only a need to explain behaviour rather than personal experience itself.

The origin of this identification of qualia with judgements can be seen in ''Consciousness Explained'' p407-408. Dennett considers the experiences of someone looking at the world, and describes his idea of the relationship between conscious experience, mind and representation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It seemed to him, according to the text, as if his mind - his visual field - were filled with intricate details of gold-green buds and wiggling branches, but although this is how it seemed this was an illusion. No such &quot;plenum&quot; ever came into his mind; the plenum remained out in the world where it didn't have to be represented, but could just be. When we marvel, in those moments of heightened self-consciousness, at the glorious richness of our conscious experience, the richness we marvel at is actually the richness of the world outside, in all its ravishing detail. It does not &quot;enter&quot; our conscious minds, but is simply available&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Dennett minds have no &quot;plenum&quot;, no space with objects in it, the plenum is things outside the mind. Dennett considers mind to be processes. In his imaginary dialogue with 'Otto' in Consciousness Explained Dennett has Otto say &quot;Are you denying then that consciousness is a plenum?&quot; to which he replies &quot;Yes indeed. That's part of what I am denying. Consciousness is gappy and sparse, and doesn't contain half of what people think is there!&quot;. (CE p366). Unfortunately Dennett's assertion is difficult to understand because even half a plenum is a plenum, perhaps his remarks given above that 'conscious experience' has a plenum but 'mind' does not, explain his equivocation. This means that Dennett has moved conscious experience into the world outside the body.  Unfortunately this still leaves the problem of how this world is turned into the view that we each enjoy (there are no images in the world  other than those created by optical instruments such as the eye).  Has Dennett shifted the problem of conscious experience from a problem of brain function into a problem of the physics of the world outside the body?

[[Image:Constuddennett.png]]

Dennett makes a sharp distinction between information in the world and information in the brain. The information in the world seems to be allowed to be a plenum that can enter conscious experience but ceases to be a plenum in the mind. In contrast, according to Dennett the information in the brain is a &quot;logical space&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;So we do have a way of making sense of the idea of phenomenal space - as a logical space.  This is a space into which or in which nothing is literally projected; its properties are simply constituted by the beliefs of the (heterophenomenological) subject.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although how a &quot;logical space&quot; differs from a real space if it contains several things at an instant is not explained and how this &quot;logical space&quot; appears like phenomenal space at each instant is also not covered.

Dennett also attacks &quot;Cartesian materialism&quot; which he defines very precisely as the idea that there is a Cartesian theatre in the brain:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lets call the idea of such a centered locus in the brain ''Cartesian materialism'', since its the view you arrive at when you discard Descarte's dualism but fail to discard the imagery of a central (but material) Theater where &quot;it all comes together&quot;. The pineal gland would be one candidate for such a Cartesian Theater, but there are others that have been suggested - the anterior cingulate, the reticular formation, various places in the frontal lobes. Cartesian materialism is the view that there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of &quot;presentation&quot; in experience because what ''happens'' there is what you are conscious of.&quot;(CE p107)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It seems that Dennett is unaware of earlier uses of the term &quot;Cartesian materialism&quot; meaning the concept that the mind is in the brain and co-opts the term for his own use.  In Consciousness Explained Dennett assumes a model of Cartesian Materialism where some entity is looking at a theatre of events.  This is a dynamical interpretation of perception based on the idea that physical events are due to Whiteheadian materialism.  As such it is unlike the “theatre” that Aristotle envisaged in his “self aware sense” which has a view but no homunculus to view it. Indeed Dennett(1999) eschews the geometrical physicalism of the last century of physics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A curious anachronism found in many but not all of these reactionaries is that to the extent that they hold out any hope at all of solution to the problem (or problems) of consciousness, they speculate that it will come not from biology or cognitive science, but from–of all things!–physics! ....... Not just philosophers and linguists have found this an attractive idea. Many physicists have themselves jumped on the bandwagon, following the lead of Roger Penrose, whose speculations about quantum fluctuations in the microtubules of neurons have attracted considerable attention and enthusiasm in spite of a host of problems. What all these views have in common is the idea that some revolutionary principle of physics could be a rival to the idea that consciousness is going to be explained in terms of “parts which work one upon another,” as in Leibniz’s mill.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(The section of this book on Leibniz shows that he could find nothing resembling human perception in his mill). Dennett(1998) describes consciousness as distributed in time and space: &quot;Consciousness doesn't have to happen at an instant; it is much better to think of it as distributed in both space and time.&quot; but, unlike Descartes, Broad or Whitehead uses an early materialist conception of time and process to describe it.

==Ned Block (1942- )==
[[wikipedia:Ned Block|Ned Block]] is in the [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/ NYU Department of Philosophy].

===Two types of consciousness===

According to Block{{ref|Block1995}}, &quot;Phenomenal consciousness is experience; the phenomenally conscious aspect of a state is what it is like to be in that state. The mark of access-consciousness, by contrast, is availability for use in reasoning and rationally guiding speech and action.&quot; Block feels that it is ''possible'' to have phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness independently of each other, but in general they do interact.

There is no generally agreed upon way of categorizing different types of consciousness. Block's distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness tries to distinguish between conscious states that either do or do not directly involve the control of thought and action.

'''Phenomenal consciousness'''. According to Block, phenomenal consciousness results from sensory experiences such as hearing, smelling, tasting, and having pains. Block groups together as phenomenal consciousness the '''experiences''' such as sensations, feelings, perceptions, thoughts, wants and emotions. Block excludes from phenomenal consciousness anything having to do with cognition, intentionality, or with &quot;properties definable in a computer program&quot;. 

'''Access consciousness'''. Access consciousness is available for use in reasoning and for direct conscious control of action and speech. For Block, the &quot;reportability&quot; of access consciousness is of great practical importance. Also, access consciousness '''must''' be &quot;representational&quot; because only representational content can figure in reasoning. Examples of access consciousness are thoughts, beliefs, and desires.

A potential source of confusion is that some phenomenal consciousness is also representational. The key distinction to keep in mind about representational content that Block would place in the access consciousness category is that the reason it is placed in the access consciousness category is because of its representational aspect. Elements of phenomenal consciousness are assigned to the phenomenal consciousness category because of their phenomenal content.

====Reaction====
An immediate point of controversy for Block's attempt to divide consciousness into the subdivisions of phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness is that some people view the mind as resulting (in its entirety) from fundamentally computational processes. This computational view of mind implies that ALL of consciousness is &quot;definable in a computer program&quot;, so Block's attempt to describe some consciousness as phenomenal consciousness cannot succeed in identifying a distinct category of conscious states. This viewpoint is highly contentious however, see [[Consciousness Studies/The Neuroscience Of Consciousness#The_problem_of_machine_and_digital_consciousness|The problem of machine and digital consciousness for a discussion]]

As mentioned above, Block feels that phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness normally interact, but it is possible to have access consciousness without phenomenal consciousness. In particular, Block believes that zombies are possible and a robot could exist that is &quot;computationally identical to a person&quot; while having no phenomenal consciousness. Similarly, Block feels that you can have an animal with phenomenal consciousness but no access consciousness.

Block shares Chalmers' belief that we can have conscious experiences that are not possible to produce by any type of computational algorithm and that the source of such experiences is &quot;the hard problem&quot; of consciousness. To functionalists Block's position with respect to consciousness is analogous to that of Vitalists who defined Life as being in a category distinct from all possible physical processes. To those who support phenomenal consciousness the functionalist viewpoint is like believing in a flat earth, flat earthers see the world through biblical cosmology and functionalists view it through nineteenth century science. Biologists refute Vitalism by describing the physical processes that account for Life. Cosmologists refute biblical cosmology by describing modern physics. In order to refute Block's claim about the distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness, it is up to biologists and artificial consciousness researchers to describe computational algorithms that account for consciousness. In order to refute functionalism philosophers and scientists draw attention to the fact that they are trying to explain an internal state of a conscious observer, something that cannot be explained in terms of the external behaviour of machines.

Why are some neurobiologists and computer scientists sure that Block's division of consciousness is wrong? What is the source of Block's certainty that there are non-computational forms of consciousness? One example of phenomenal consciousness discussed by Block is a loud noise that you do not consciously notice because you are paying attention to something else. Block is sure that you were aware of the noise (phenomenal consciousness) but just not &quot;consciously aware&quot; (access consciousness). Many scientists would say that in this case, you were not &quot;consciously aware&quot; of the noise, but it is almost certain that portions of your unconscious brain activity responded to the noise (you could electrically record activity in the primary auditory cortex that is clearly a response to action potentials arriving from the ears due to sound waves from the noise). This suggests that Block's controversial &quot;non-computational&quot; category of phenomenal consciousness includes brain activity that others would categorize as being unconscious, not conscious. Some unconscious brain activity can begin to contribute to consciousness when the focus of one's conscious awareness shifts. This suggests that some of what Block calls phenomenal consciousness is brain activity that can either take place outside of consciousness or as part of consciousness, depending on other things that might be going on in the brain at the same time. If so, we can ask why the consciously experienced version of this kind of brain activity is computational while the unconscious version is not. On the other hand many authors (Eddington, Broad, Penrose, McFadden, Zeh etc.) would point out that brain activity could be both computational and phenomenal.

Block stresses that he makes use of introspection to distinguish between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness. Presumably this means that when the loud noise was not noticed, it was not accessed by introspection. Block has thus defined a category of consciousness that is outside of our &quot;conscious awareness&quot; (although he says we are &quot;aware&quot; of it in some other way) and not accessed by introspection. Maybe it is this inaccessibility of some cases of phenomenal consciousness that motivate Block's idea that such forms of consciousness cannot be computational. When experiences are accessible to introspection and available for inclusion in reasoning processes, we can begin to imagine computational algorithms for the generation of the content of those experience. However, it is difficult to imagine how the content could become the same as the form of our experience.

===Forms of phenomenal consciousness that are open to introspection===
In his 1995 article, Block went on to discuss the more interesting cases such as if upon starting to &quot;pay attention to&quot; the loud noise (see above) that was previously ignored, the experiencer noticed that there had been ''some'' earlier experience of the noise, just not of the type that we &quot;pay attention to&quot;; a type of experience that had been just &quot;on the edge&quot; of access consciousness.

In Ned Block's entry for &quot;Consciousness&quot; in the 2004 Oxford Companion to the Mind{{ref|Block2004}}, he discusses another example that he feels distinguishes between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness.

:&quot;Liss{{ref|Liss}} presented subjects with 4 letters in two circumstances,

:long, e.g. 40 msec, followed by a “mask” known to make stimuli hard to identify &lt;BR&gt;
:or &lt;BR&gt;
:short, e.g. 9 msec, without a mask.  

:Subjects could identify 3 of the 4 letters on average in the short case but said they were weak and fuzzy.  In the long case, they could identify only one letter, but said they could see them all and that the letters were sharper, brighter and higher in contrast.  This experiment suggests a double dissociation: the short stimuli were phenomenally poor but perceptually and conceptually OK, whereas the long stimuli were phenomenally sharp but perceptually or conceptually poor, as reflected in the low reportability.&quot;  

This experiment demonstrates a distinction between &lt;BR&gt;
:i) reportability of names of the letters &lt;BR&gt;
:and &lt;BR&gt;
:ii) perceptual sharpness of the image. &lt;BR&gt;
Block's definitions of these two types of consciousness leads us to the conclusion that a non-computational process can present us with phenomenal consciousness of the forms of the letters, while we can imagine an additional computational algorithm for extracting the names of the letters from their form (this is why computer programs can perform character recognition). The ability of a computer to perform character recognition does not imply that it has phenomenal consciousness or that it need share our ability to be consciously aware of the forms of letters that it can algorithmically match to their names.

====Reactions====
If Block's distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness is correct, then it has important implications for attempts by [[Consciousness Studies/The Neuroscience Of Consciousness|neuroscientists]] to identify the neural correlates of consciousness and for attempts by computer scientists to produce artificial consciousness in man-made devices such as robots. In particular, Block seems to suggest that non-computational mechanisms for producing the subjective experiences of phenomenal consciousness must be found in order to account for the richness of human consciousness or for there to be a way to rationally endow man-made machines with a similarly rich scope of personal experiences of &quot;what it is like to be in conscious states&quot;. Other philosophers of consciousness such as [[wikipedia:John Searle|John Searle]] have similarly suggested that there is something fundamental about subjective experience that cannot be captured by conventional computer programs. This has led to proposals by physicists such as Penrose, Stapp, McFadden etc. for non-digital versions of machines with artificial consciousness.

Many advocates of the idea that there is a fundamentally computational basis of mind feel that the phenomenal aspects of consciousness do not lie outside of the bounds of what can be accomplished by computation{{ref|general}}. Some of the conflict over the importance of the distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness centers on just what is meant by terms such as &quot;computation&quot;, &quot;program&quot; and &quot;algorithm&quot;. In practical terms, how can we know if it is within the power of &quot;computation&quot;, &quot;program&quot; or &quot;algorithm&quot; to produce human-like consciousness? There is a problem of verification; can we ever really know if we have a correct biological account of the mechanistic basis of conscious experience and how can we ever know if a robot has phenomenal consciousness? Although of course, such misgivings apply both to those who believe that digital consciousness is possible and those who disagree. 

&lt;!-- why is this relevant to Block? It is discussed in great depth later

The results of the experiment of Liss (discussed above) can have several interpretations. Viewing printed letters can lead to activation of many different brain regions and brain processes. Some parts of the brain that are devoted just to visual processing make heavy contributions to our ability to form a clear mental image of the shape, form and color of letters. These brain regions allow us to become aware of visual features but we are almost totally unable to have any introspective insight into how we become aware of shape, form and color. Other parts of the brain are required for our normal ability to report the names of letters that we see. The experiment shows that by controlling the exact conditions under which experimental subjects are asked to report their experience of the letters, conditions will either favor awareness of letter form or awareness of the letter's names. Presumably, a sufficiently detailed analysis of brain activity would reveal how the variable test conditions of the experiment result in different patterns of activity in various parts of the brain and would allow for an account of the results of the experiment in terms of the details of brain function. 
--&gt;

&lt;!-- it is generally understood that inner speech and language are not consciousness - are deaf mutes and people with strokes unconscious?

Most philosophers participate in introspective efforts to understand the steps involved in their own linguistic competencies. Introspection can allow us to be aware of mental processes that seem to have a linear sequence for the production of speech or lines of reasoning. Computer science also has an established history of defining explicit algorithms by which strings of words can be placed in grammatically correct orders and various theorem generating programs now exist which seem to replicate some aspects of reasoning. Thus, introspection combined with knowledge of what computer science has and has not yet accomplished provides philosophers with certain intuitions{{ref|Block1997}} about the nature of consciousness and the nature of computation. In particular, Block along with Penrose, Zeh, Stapp, Eccles, Edelman, Weyl etc has been led to suspect that phenomenal consciousness is fundamentally outside of the range of things that can be done with programs.--&gt;

Block's justification of access and phenomenal consciousness uses a nineteenth century idea of the world so cannot be easily sustained against attack from functionalists and eliminativists. However he has clearly described a persistent division in the science and philosophy of consciousness that dates from the time of Aristotle. Aristotle considers this division in terms of those who consider that the soul originates movement and those who consider it to be cognitive, Descartes has the res cogitans and res extensa, Kant has the noumenal and phenomenal, Whitehead has the apparent and causative etc. and even Dennett has the reflex and emergent.

== Francis Crick (1916 - 2004) ==

Francis Crick (1994) The Astonishing Hypothesis. The Scientific Search for the Soul. Simon &amp; Schuster Ltd. London.

[[Image:Francis_Crick.png|left|thumb|Crick]]Crick begins this book with a statement about his opinion of the insignificance of human beings:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The Astonishing Hypothesis is that &quot;You&quot;, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules. As Lewis Carroll's Alice might have phrased it: &quot;you're nothing but a pack of neurons&quot;. This hypothesis is so alien to the ideas of most people alive today that it can truly be called astonishing.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Crick is not a philosopher so might be forgiven the derogatory &quot;no more than..&quot;, as a scientist he realises that the assembly of nerve cells that form a brain is highly complex and difficult to understand.

He suggests that the hypothesis is &quot;so surprising&quot; for three reasons:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The first is that many people are reluctant to accept what is often called the &quot;reductionist approach&quot; - that a complex system can be explained by the behaviour of its parts and their interactions with each other.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

......

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The second reason why the Astonishing Hypothesis seems so strange is the nature of consciousness. We have, for example, a vivid internal picture of the external world. It might seem a category mistake to believe this is merely another way of talking about the behavior of neurons, but we have just seen that arguments of this type are not always to be trusted.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

......

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The third reason why the Astonishing Hypothesis seems strange springs from our undeniable feeling that Free Will is free. ... I believe that if we solve the problem of awareness (or consciousness), the explanation of Free Will is likely to be easier to solve.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

Crick believes that many phenomena in the brain are &quot;emergent&quot; with the vague implication that consciousness may also be emergent. He defines this term in the following way:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The scientific meaning of emergent, or at least the one I use, assumes that, while the whole may not be the simple sum of the separate parts, its behavior can, at least in principle, be understood from the nature and behavior of its parts plus the knowledge of how all these parts interact.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

He wants to avoid the philosophical debates about the nature of consciousness:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;1. Everyone has a rough idea of what is meant by consciousness. It is better to avoid a precise definition of consciousness because of the dangers of premature definition. &lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;Footnote: If this seems like cheating, try defining for me the word gene. So much is now known about genes that any simple definition is likely to be inadequate. How much more difficult, then, to define a biological term when rather little is known about it.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

This is an odd standpoint because any brief review of the ideas of philosophers shows that a good deal is known about phenomenal consciousness. The problem lies in explaining such a bizarre experience, not in defining it.

He then elaborates a further four points covering general features of consciousness and avoiding various types of speculation about consciousness. Excluded are: &quot;what consciousness is for&quot;, speculations about consciousness in lower animals and the &quot;self-referential aspect of consciousness&quot;; included are the concept of consciousness in &quot;higher mammals&quot;.

As a guide for the scientific investigation of consciousness he puts forward three basic ideas:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;1. Not all the operations of the brain correspond to consciousness.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;2. Consciousness involves some form of memory, probably a very short term one.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;3. Consciousness is closely associated with attention.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

The operations of the brain that do correspond to consciousness are the &quot;neural correlates of consciousness&quot; a term that probably predates Crick's work. Crick shows the openness of ideal science when he concludes with:

&lt;font face=&quot;times new roman&quot;&gt;&quot;The Astonishing Hypothesis may be proved correct. Alternatively some view closer to the religious one may become more plausible. There is always a third possibility: that the facts support a new, alternative way of looking at the mind-brain problem that is significantly different from the rather crude materialistic view many neuroscientists hold today and also from the religious point of view.&quot;&lt;/font&gt;

==David J Chalmers==
===Review of &quot;The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory&quot;. Oxford University Press. 1996.===

[[Image:David_Chalmers.jpg|thumb|left|Chalmers]]Chalmers is perhaps most famous for the &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;... I find myself absorbed in an orange sensation, and ''something is going on''. There is something that needs explaining, even after we have explained the process of discrimination: there is the ''experience''.&quot;p xii&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;....&quot;This might be seen as a Great Divide in the study of consciousness. If you hold that an answer to the &quot;easy&quot; problems explains everything that needs to be explained, then you get one sort of theory; if you hold that there is a further &quot;hard&quot; problem then you get another.&quot;p xiii&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chalmers describes mind as having &quot;phenomenal&quot; and &quot;psychological&quot; aspects.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;At the root of all this lie two quite distinct concepts of mind. The first is the ''phenomenal'' concept of mind. This is the concept of mind as conscious experience, and of a mental state as a consciously experienced mental state. ... The second is the ''psychological'' concept of mind. This is the concept of mind as the causal or explanatory basis for behaviour.&quot; p11 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chalmers proposes that consciousness can be explained by a form of &quot;Naturalistic Dualism&quot; that is supported by the following argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In particular, the failure of logical supervenience directly implies that materialism is false: there are features of the world over and above the physical features.  The basic argument for this goes as follows:
# In our world there are conscious experiences.
# There is a logically possible world physically identical to ours, in which the positive facts about consciousness in our world do not hold.
# Therefore facts about consciousness are further facts about our world, over and above the physical facts.
# So materialism is false.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chalmers describes his naturalistic dualism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The dualism implied here is instead a kind of ''property'' dualism: conscious experience involves properties of an individual that are not entailed by the physical properties of that individual.  Consciousness is a ''feature'' of the world over and above the physical features of the world.  This is not to say that it is a separate &quot;substance&quot;; the issue of what it would take to constitute a dualism of substances seems quite unclear to me. All we know is that there are properties of individuals in this world - the phenomenal properties - that are ontologically independent of physical properties.&quot; p125&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To substantiate his argument he proposes that &quot;zombie&quot; worlds, in which people would behave like us but not be conscious, are logically possible and that worlds that are physically identical to ours, but where conscious experiences are inverted, are logically possible. 

Chalmers' argument about the possibility of zombies runs as follows:

A zombie is defined as &quot;...someone or something physically identical to me (or to any other conscious being), but lacking conscious experiences altogether&quot;. Chalmers considers that silicon based devices or an entity based on the population of china could lack conscious experience although being able to perform the same functions as a person. He then makes a logical leap to suggest that these examples show that something physically identical to a conscious person could not be conscious:

&quot;But given that it is conceptually coherent that the group-mind set-up or my silicon isomorph could lack conscious experience, it follows that my zombie twin is an equally coherent possibility.&quot;p97&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the inverted spectrum argument Chalmers argues that it is logically possible to imagine a world that is physically identical to ours yet where conscious beings experience an inverted spectrum.  This assertion is defended on the basis of the elementary science of colour vision.

Unfortunately, without any definite proposal for how conscious experience is realised it seems premature to declare that the zombie and inverted spectrum arguments are correct. Chalmers approaches the problem of the realization of conscious experience when discussing &quot;information&quot;.

Chalmers is aware that phenomenal consciousness includes information that is related to information in the physical world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A conscious experience is a realization of an information state; a phenomenal judgement is explained by another realization of the same information state. And in a sense, postulating a phenomenal aspect of information is all we need to do to make sure those judgements are truly correct; there really ''is'' a qualitative aspect to this information, showing up directly in phenomenology and not just a system of judgements.&quot;p 292&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unfortunately he does not explain what a phenomenal &quot;realization of an information state&quot; means.  This leads him to consider any information state as potentially capable of conscious experience. He notes that &quot;We find information everywhere, not just in systems that we standardly take to be conscious.&quot; and asks whether a thermostat could be conscious.  He poses the question &quot;As we move along the scale from fish and slugs through simple neural networks all the way to thermostats, where should consciousness wink out?&quot;.  

He answers the objection that there may not be any ''room'' for consciousness in a thermostat by saying that &quot;If consciousness is not logically supervenient, we should not expect to have to find &quot;room&quot; for consciousness in a system's organization; consciousness is quite distinct from the processing properties of the system&quot;. He concludes the thermostat article by declaring that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;While it ''could'' be the case that experience winks in at a particular point, any specific point seems arbitrary, so a theory that avoids having to make this decision gains a certain simplicity.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This set of ideas leads to the possibility of panpsychism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If there is experience associated with thermostats, there is probably experience ''everywhere'': wherever there is a causal interaction, there is information, and wherever there is information there is experience.&quot; p297&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Chalmers states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Personally, I am much more confident of naturalistic dualism than I am of panpsychism.  The latter issue seems to be very much open. But I hope to have said enough to show that we ought to take the possibility of some sort of panpsychism seriously...&quot; p299&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He then postulates that &quot;Phenomenal properties have an intrinsic nature, one that is not exhausted by their location in an information space, and it seems that a purely informational view of the world leaves no room for these intrinsic qualities.&quot;. This leads him to suggest that the world is more than just information, that we &quot;''need'' some intrinsic nature in the world, to ground information states&quot;.  This leads him to propose that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;So the suggestion is that the information spaces required by physics are themselves grounded in phenomenal and protophenomenal properties. Each instantiation of such an information space is in fact a ''phenomenal'' (or protophenomenal) realization. Every time a feature such as mass and charge is realized, there is an intrinsic property, or ''microphenomenal'' property for short. We will have a set of basic microphenomenal spaces, one for each fundamental physical property, and it is these spaces that will ground the information spaces that physics requires.&quot; p305&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So Chalmers takes the proposal of panpsychism, based on the idea that all information spaces might be conscious, to &quot;ground&quot; the information space. Again, any description of how phenomenal consciousness is actually realized in an information space is missing.

Chalmers' explanation of information seems to mystify it, in physics information is arrangements of things, in maths or digital transmission it is usually arrangements of the same thing. For instance 11011 is an arrangement of ones and zeroes along a line - the information has not replaced reality it is simply a way of using reality to represent something else.  As Zurek put it: &quot;there is no information without representation&quot;. Hence it is difficult to see why microphenomena should be required to instantiate information when the information is already instantiated.

The concept of information as something that can be transmitted from place to place and also as a property of a substance is at the heart of Chalmer's analysis. He states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We have no way to peek inside a dog's brain, for instance, and observe the presence or absence of conscious experience. The status of this problem is controversial, but the mere ''prima facie'' existence of the problem is sufficient to defeat an epistemological argument, parallel to those above, for the logical supervenience of consciousness. By contrast there is not even a ''prima facie'' problem of other biologies, or other economies.  Those facts are straightforwardly publically accessible, precisely because they are fixed by the physical facts.&quot; p74&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The patterns of things that comprise &quot;biologies&quot; are, according to this,  &quot;physical facts&quot;. But from the argument about panpsychism above, physical facts are not grounded, they are information that must be instantiated in some way through &quot;microphenomenal&quot; properties. Chalmers seems to be arguing that nothing logically supervenes on the physical because nothing logically supervenes on mind and physical things are mind. 

He introduces the idea of ''organizational invariance'' as the key feature of a conscious system and declares that a set of beer cans could be conscious:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I claim that conscious experience arises from fine-grained functional organization. More specifically, I will argue for a ''principle of organizational invariance'', holding that given any system that has conscious experiences, then any system that has the same fine-grained functional organization will have qualitatively identical experiences. According to this principle, consciousness is an organizational invariant: a property that remains constant over all functional isomorphs of a given system. Whether the organization is realized in silicon chips, in the population of China, or in beer cans and ping-pong balls does not matter. As long as the functional organisation is right, conscious experience will be determined.&quot; p249&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Constudbeer.png]]

If two systems have entirely the same fine grained '''form''' and function as each other are they not identical systems? Although Chalmer's arguments stress ''function'' is it the sleight of hand of arguing for fine grained equivalence of ''form'' that makes the argument difficult to gainsay?  Is a statement of identity an explanation?

==Thomas Nagel==

Review of: [http://web.archive.org/19990218140703/members.aol.com/NeoNoetics/Nagel_Bat.html What is it like to be a bat? The Philosophical Review LXXXIII, 4 (October 1974): 435-50].

Thomas Nagel is one of the leading defenders of the concept of phenomenal consciousness, in his article ''What it is like to be a bat'' he wrote:

&quot;..fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is to be that organism—something it is like for the organism.&quot;  

In particular Nagel points out that there are likely to be states within a bat that cannot be imagined by humans:

&quot;But bat sonar, though clearly a form of perception, is not similar in its operation to any sense that we possess, and there is no reason to suppose that it is subjectively like anything we can experience or imagine. This appears to create difficulties for the notion of what it is like to be a bat. We must consider whether any method will permit us to extrapolate to the inner life of the bat from our own case,5 and if not, what alternative methods there may be for understanding the notion.&quot; 

He considers that reductionism leaves out something essential in our understanding:

&quot;Most of the neobehaviorism of recent philosophical psychology results from the effort to substitute an objective concept of mind for the real thing, in order to have nothing left over which cannot be reduced. If we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue how this could be done. The problem is unique. If mental processes are indeed physical processes, then there is something it is like, intrinsically, to undergo certain physical processes. What it is for such a thing to be the case remains a mystery.&quot;

In common with word processors, Wikitext allows the use of paragraph indents and various kinds of bullet and numbered lists.  The few examples below show how it is done.

Indents are broadly similar to the idea of ''tabs'' on a word processor, though they can be used only at the ''start'' of a line.

Numbered lists find use in formal listings such as legal documents, and in specifications and other texts where   paragraph reference numbers might be quoted. Bullets are much used in lists of hyperlinks, and in many summaries.

An introduction to HTML lists has been included, since this method alone allows the use of the alphabet and Roman numbers for list labels.

{{Block|ff=inherit|ta=left|background=linen|1=&lt;h2&gt;Indentation&lt;/h2&gt;
'''Indentation means increasing a paragraph's left margin'''.  In wikitext this TAB character is the ''colon''.  When a colon is added before the start of a paragraph, the ''whole paragraph'' will be moved in by one TAB stop.  To move the paragraph further, simply add more colons. Here is the text to indent three short paragraphs:

background=ivory|&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:ivory; border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;:This was given ''one'' indent

::This was given ''two'' indents

:::This was given ''three'' indents&lt;/pre&gt;}}
and the result of doing so is:
{{block|background=white|ta=left|ff=inherit|
:This was given ''one'' indent

::This was given ''two'' indents

:::This was given ''three'' indents}}

Note that indents are often used in combination with other symbols such as bullets; when they used in this way the indents should be written first, ''then'' the bullets.}}
{{block|background=floralwhite|ff=inherit|ta=left|1=&lt;h2&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;

The table of contents found on each page is handled automatically by the software and is not accessible using the list syntax.  This subject refers to user-made lists within the text.

Lists are useful for short comments and summaries and are easy to make.

&lt;h3&gt;Numbered Lists&lt;/h3&gt;

To make an automatically numbered list of the first order, just add a hash symbol, sometimes called an ''octothorp'' or ''number sign'', before each line of the list.  It looks like this:

{lock|background=ivory|ta=left|
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:transparent;border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
#The First Item
#The Second Item
#The Third Item
#The Fourth Item
#The Fifth Item&lt;/pre&gt;}}
The result is this:
{{block|background=white|ff=inherit|ta=left|
#The First Item
#The Second Item
#The Third Item
#The Fourth Item
#The Fifth Item}}

To add a second order of numbering to the list, give the sub-items ''two'' hash symbols.  The sub-item will then indent itself beneath the level one list item that resides above it.  Additional levels of listing are made by adding more hash symbols.  Here is an example:

{{block|background=ivory|ff=inherit|ta=left|
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:transparent;border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
#The First Item
##Sub Item
#The Second Item
#The Third Item
##Sub Item
###Sub-sub Item
#The Fourth Item
#The Fifth Item&lt;/pre&gt;}}   
The result of this wikitext coding is:
{{block|background=white|ff=inherit|ta=left|
#The First Item
##Sub Item
#The Second Item
#The Third Item
##Sub Item
###Sub-sub Item
#The Fourth Item
#The Fifth Item}}
&lt;br&gt;
}}
{{block|ff=inherit|background=lavenderblush|ta=left|1=&lt;h3&gt;Bullet Lists&lt;/h3&gt;
Bullet lists are used more often than numbered lists, perhaps because they are less formal.  The bullet lists make blue square bullets against each item in the list.  It is done by adding an ''asterisk'' before each list item.  Additional levels of listing are made by adding more asterisks.  Using the same theme as above, consider the following text:

{{block|background=ivory|ff=inherit|ta=left|
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:transparent;border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
*The First Item
**Sub Item
*The Second Item
*The Third Item
**Sub Item
***Sub-sub Item
*The Fourth Item
*The Fifth Item&lt;/pre&gt;}}
The result of this text listing is:
{{block|background=white|ff=inherit|ta=left|
*The First Item
**Sub Item
*The Second Item
*The Third Item
**Sub Item
***Sub-sub Item
*The Fourth Item
*The Fifth Item}}

Since lists are made up of paragraphs, it is a simple matter to add ''colons'' for indentation ''before'' the list code to shift each list item further across the page.  Colons need added to ''each'' list item for this effect.}}

{{block|ff=inherit|background=lemonchiffon|ta=left|1=&lt;h3&gt;Definition Lists&lt;/h3&gt;
Definition lists are usefully formatted for their purpose.  They have a bold heading, followed by a normal text section on the lines that follow.  Their name is self explanatory, for these lists are ideal for defining terms.  They can be made in both HTML and Wikitext but only the simpler wikitext version is explained here.  Note that the method needs only the ''semi-colon'' and the ''full-colon'' for its effect.  The following text entry shows how to make list items:

{{block|background=ivory|ff=inherit|ta=left|
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:ivory; border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
;Mono-spaced fonts:A mono-spaced font is so-named because every glyph in the set has equal width...
;Proportional fonts:Proportional fonts are made with glyphs of different width...
;WikiBooks house font:The WikiBooks house font is 9 point ''Arial'' roman, a proportional font with a particularly clear style...The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog's back.   The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog's back.
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
The result of this text listing is:
{{block|background=white|ff=inherit|ta=left|
;Mono-spaced fonts:A mono-spaced font is so-named because every glyph in the set has equal width...
;Proportional fonts:These fonts are made with glyphs of different width...
;WikiBooks house font:The WikiBooks house font is 9 point ''Arial'' roman, a proportional font with a particularly clear style...The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog's back.   The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog's back.}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
Note that wrapped lines  are also indented.

{{block|ff=inherit|background=lightyellow|ta=left|1=&lt;h3&gt;Other Ordered Lists&lt;/h3&gt;
'''Alpha and Roman lists need HTML formats.'''  These other list types are easily made in HTML, as well as the more usual numbered lists.  In addition, their starting points can be preset.

The rules for making these alternative lists are as follows:
*Ordered lists are enclosed in the tags '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.
*Each list item must start with the tag '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''.
*&lt;u&gt;The list ''format''&lt;/u&gt; is set as follows in the leading '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tag with the ''type'' attribute.  See the drop-box for examples.
**'''Numbering''' is set with ''type=1''; ''the number one''.
**'''Lower case alphabet''' is set with ''type=a'' 
**'''Upper case alphabet''' is set with ''type=A'' 
**'''Lower case Roman''' numbers are set with ''type=i'' 
**'''Upper case Roman''' numbers are set with ''type=I''; ''the capital letter.''

*&lt;u&gt;The start value&lt;/u&gt; is also set in the leading '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tag, with the ''start'' attribute.  See the drop-box for examples.
**'''Numbered lists''' use the intended start integer as a value. If omitted, the default is always equivalent to the first character of the intended set, as decided by ''type''.
**'''Alpha lists''' use the alphabet position value; e.g. ''start=3'' for 'c'.
**'''Zero and negative start values have no meaning''' except for numbered lists.

*&lt;u&gt;Arbitrary list labels&lt;/u&gt; can be set in any '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tag with the ''value'' attribute.  The label must belong to the selected ''type''.  For example, if ''type'' is for an alphabetic list, an arbitrary Roman number would be inappropriate.
**'''Values are numbers''' representing the position in the ''type'' set; ''e.g. 3 for 'c' ''.
**'''The start attribute''' should be omitted for this method; ''avoids confusion''.
**'''List items without values''' will ''follow-on'' from the previous label.

In the event that list-making adversely affects follow-on text, ensure that there is a blank line or a break tag between the two.  Examples of HTML list formats can be found in the drop-box below.

Consider the following example.  The sample code uses ''type=a'' to choose lower case alpha listing and the entry ''start=2'' sets the starting point as the second letter of the alphabet; the letter ''b''.
{{block|ta=left|background=ivory|&lt;pre style=&quot;font-size:1.1em;background:ivory; border:none; white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt; These listing labels use lower case alphabet.
&lt;li&gt; This list starts with the ''second'' letter of the alphabet.
&lt;li&gt; Change ''type'' and ''start'' value for different formats.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
When the code runs it looks like this:
{{block|background=white|ta=left|ff=inherit|1=&lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt; These listing labels use lower case alphabet.
&lt;li&gt; This list starts with the ''second'' letter of the alphabet.
&lt;li&gt; Change ''type'' and ''start'' value for different formats.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt; This is the first item of upper case starting with A.
&lt;li&gt; This is the second item.
&lt;li&gt; This is the last.

&lt;li&gt; This is the first lower case roman item starting with iii.
&lt;li&gt; This is the second item.
&lt;li&gt; This is the last.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

{{hiddenh3|Roman Numbers, Upper Case}}
With ''type = I'', (the capital letter ''eye''), and ''start = 2''
&lt;ol type=&quot;I&quot; start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt; This is the first uppercase roman item starting with II.
&lt;li&gt; This is the second item.
&lt;li&gt; This is the last.
&lt;/ol&gt;

{{hiddenh3|Negative Numbers}}
With ''type = 1'', (the number ''one''), and ''start = -29''
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot; start=&quot;-29&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt; This is the first number starting with -29.
&lt;li&gt; This is the second item.
&lt;li&gt; This is the last.
&lt;/ol&gt;

{{hiddenh3|More Negative Numbers}}
With ''type = 1'', (the number ''one''), and ''start = -1''
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot; start=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt; This is the first number starting with -1.
&lt;li&gt; This is the second item.
&lt;li&gt; This is the last.
&lt;/ol&gt;

Proper reversed lists will become a part of HTML5.  See [http://blog.whatwg.org/reverse-ordered-lists  '''Reversed Lists'''].
}}

The various listing options are easily changed, and an alternative method for simple numbering of lines can be found in [[Editing_Wikitext/Preformatted_Text#Numbered_Prose|'''Numbered Prose''']].  Although ''bullet'' lists can be made in HTML by setting the list items in '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags instead of '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags, the rendering is likely to afford only the default bullet type instead of the three types that are theoretically possible.  For a complete description of HTML lists refer to the external page [http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/lists.html '''Lists in HTML'''].}}

==Introduction==
Pictures, or images, are common on wiki pages.   You can add them to your pages, and this series is intended to explain how it is done.

Image layouts are numerous.   Most images in Wiki are positioned at the left or right margins and the text is allowed to wrap around them.   Others are positioned in a line across the page.   Some are intended for the top of a page, along with a table of contents.   Galleries can contain many images, and in a wide range of formats, and drop controls can contain any or all of these.

Whether the writer is new to image placement or experienced in their use, he will find something in these pages that is useful.   Select from the links below, according to your area of interest.    

*'''To position images in a basic way''' then read '''[[/The Quick Course/]]'''.

*'''To provide a lineup of tiled images across the page''' or to overlap them, then be sure to read '''[[/Tiled Images/]]'''.

*'''For more complex image placement''' read '''[[/Images in Containers/]]'''.   This page deals with image placement in tables, galleries, and drop controls, and touches on the best use of top-section white space.

Writers within a wiki are encouraged to make use of templates in their work, and several useful templates are mentioned throughout the text.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are typically four different types of poker player:

* Loose-Passive
* Loose-Aggressive
* Tight-Passive
* Tight-Aggressive

'''Loose''' means that a player's requirements to put money into the pot are lower than average.  For example, a loose player may like to play hands like K3s (suited) preflop in Holdem, and could be seeing anything from 30 to 100% of flops in that game type.

'''Tight''' is the opposite.  A tight player plays fewer hands per hour than his opponents average.    This can result in only seeing anywhere from 10% to 25% of flops in Holdem.

'''Passive''' players are those that rarely bet.  They are happy to call and fold, but they are not often seen making raises of their own.

'''Aggressive''' players on the other hand, are those that raise and reraise significantly more than the average.  They may be perfectly willing to reraise you whilst on a flush draw, or whilst holding second pair.

Obviously the degrees of aggressiveness or tightness vary from player to player, but the vast majority will fit quite neatly into these classifications.  Coupled with issues like how weak or strong a player your opponent is, you will have a powerful tool to help you decide what your opponent is holding in each situation.  Classifying other players is also an extremely important aspect when considering your strategy for a specific table, tournament or hand.

==In-Depth Strategies==

There are many different types of poker players. The two broadest categories are those of successful and unsuccessful players. A player who is successful does not just look at what is in his hand and on the board. Players who are unable to read other players or do not make it a point to watch even when they are not in a hand are often unsuccessful as Poker players. Under the category of successful players, a successful player is able to group someone into one of many different categories. The first category is:

'''Aggressive:'''   Aggressive players will play almost any starting hand. The cards in their hand may be 2 7 of hearts and clubs and they will play it. They are the players who will contribute to some of your biggest wins and biggest losses because they are very hard to bluff out of a hand. If you are at a rock garden (table where everyone appears afraid of what others have) and one player is betting big every hand or every other hand and winning about every hand it is suggestible that if you have mid-pair you call their bluff at least once, to gain an accurate characterization of their betting patterns and because it is likely you have them beat. If someone is betting it up every hand and constantly winning and mucking it is suggestible to &quot;look them up&quot; if you think you might have it. These are the players that you don't want to try to bluff, because as bluffers themselves they will often turn the tables on you or look you up.

'''Passive Aggressive''':    Passive-Aggressive players are often the most experienced of all players, are able to get a good read on who is a rock and who is aggressive and will not throw their chips away. Passive Aggressive players often call the blind to the flop if their hand seems decent enough (middle cards or high) and will do their fair share of bluffing, but not as much as a player who is purely aggressive. These are the players who will go after you hard and smash into the aggressive players when they get a hand. Often times Passive-Aggressive players will be the big-stack at the table because they rarely call large bets into hands they don't have a good chance of winning and rarely make mistakes. The worst enemy of a Passive-Aggressive player is a &quot;River Rat&quot;.

'''River Rat''': A River-Rat is often considered the worst poker player at the table. A river rat will usually bet before the flop if they have good cards and upon seeing a flop they don't like they will call ANY bet you throw at them just hoping desperately for that miracle at the end of the river. It is a common misconception among weak poker players that you will have a tougher time making money off of these types of players, when in fact quite the contrary is true.  Profit in poker comes when your opponents make mistakes, and '''River Rats''' are constantly calling bets when they do not have the odds in their favor. 

'''Rocks''': A rock is an extraordinarily tight, patient and reserved player at the table. When they do not get a premium hand pre-flop they won't even call the blinds. When you are involved in a hand with these characters you can almost tell immediately that they have either got two high cards, an ace and a high or middle card, or a pocket pair 8 or higher. These guys rarely play hands but when they do they will bet big. Their worst enemy is an aggressive player who might scare them out of a hand. While they will normally go far they won't go as far as most passive-aggressive players or very good aggressive players. River Rats give them a very large chunk of their change because they don't realize that when a rock is betting they have little chance of winning. The worst enemy of these players is themselves. They lose a lot of money to blinds for hands that they don't play.

'''Passive-Rocks''':  Passive Rocks are the guys who will bet very very rarely. These guys will get a premium hand and will call bets with it, with an almost certain chance to win the hand will only call and will not bet. Passive Rocks are the most dangerous when they are involved in a hand with an aggressive player or a player who misreads them. Thinking that they are &quot;chasing&quot; cards because they are calling rather than betting, someone may bet an all-in on them and they will call, putting a bad hurt on whoever it is that raises them all in. Passive-Rocks generally do worse than pure rocks.

'''Slow-Players''': These are some of the craftiest players. Slow-Players have unlimited restraint on betting on a good hand in order to allow somebody to think they have the best hand. These guys know how to read others and know exactly how to look and bet like they have a bad hand or are chasing. Slow-Players are good at drawing as much money out of a hand as they can, especially when involved with aggressive players. These guys are the worst enemy of any aggressive player because of the toughness of getting a read on them. A slow-player may catch three of a kind aces on the flop and check, just to draw another player into betting so that they can either A.) Raise them, B.) continue their play, acting as if they have a weak hand and meekly calling or C.) if they have plenty of chips and want to mislead other players as to how they play they will fold this hand and show the table then saying something like &quot;I KNOW you have the straight&quot; simply to make other players think that they are rocks or easy to get out of a hand and therefore making it easier for them to bluff.

'''The Perfect Player''' This guy can read you by your actions, he knows exactly what kind of hands you play by observing you when he is and is not in hands with you and other players and he knows how you chat or how you bet, etc. when you have a hand, including whether you are notorious for slow-playing or not. This guy will not give any money to rocks because he knows if they are in a hand they almost certainly have an advantage over his hand and know when an aggressive player is bluffing and when he truly has a hand. He has elements of a slow-player, playing certain hands to draw money from someone who he knows will fold to a bet, has elements of a passive-aggressive player, betting big when its all river rats and aggressive players sitting around him, and a rock in the sense that he doesn't play bad hands in bad positions or with a &quot;family table&quot; meaning close to everyone at the table is in the hand. This guy has elements of every class in him. These are the players you should fear. It is hard to predict the betting pattern of these guys because it is modified depending on who they are in a hand with. The best way to learn how they play is to watch every single hand they are in and see how they act for each and every person, including yourself, because it will be modified when he is playing against you. You may even want to call some of his small bets just to learn what type of hand he will bet certain ways against you with so that he does not have a chance to muck his hand and leave you in the dark about him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bluffing is a seriously overrated concept in poker.  Yes, it is important, and yes every good player is a good bluffer.  But it is not the be-all and end-all of the game.  Certain types of players will make frequent bluffs - perhaps every 4 or 5 hands they play.  This is a high variance way of playing, and only the truly great players are significant winners in this manner.  

The mathematics of bluffing dictate this.  For example, let's say that the pot is currently $10.  I have nothing at all, and you have a moderate hand, a top pair ace kicker.  I bet $5 as a total bluff.  Whether this is profitable or not depends on the chance that you will fold.

I am betting $5 to win $10.  I must therefore succeed one time from three to make this a positive expectation move (see [[../Expected_value|expected value]]).  If you fold 30% of the time, it is a losing move from me.  If I bet $10 into the $10 pot, you must fold 50% of the time - folding 45% of the time loses me money in the long run.

== Optimal bluffing frequency ==
The reason for bluffing can be explained using a branch of mathematics called ''game theory'', which also gives an insight into the optimal frequency for bluffing (though it's usually only possible to work out the math in simplified situations).

Suppose you are playing 5-card draw poker against a single opponent. There is $10 in the pot from antes, and after the draw you have the opportunity to bet another $10 (no raises or other bet sizes are possible, to keep this simple). Your opponent gets:

[[Image:Poker-sm-21A-5s.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-229-6h.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-238-7d.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-217-8s.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-246-9c.png|80px|border]]

for a made straight, while your hand is:

[[Image:Poker-sm-214-Js.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-224-Jh.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-22C-3h.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-24C-3c.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-242-Kc.png|80px|border]]

Your opponent stands pat, so you know he has at least a flush or straight to beat your two pair. You have four cards in the deck that can help you, so you are roughly a 11 to 1 shot to improve to a full house and beat your opponent's straight. Ignoring the possibility of your opponent betting or either of you raising, you have two options: bet only if you make your hand, or bet whether you make your hand or not. Your opponent also has two choices: call or check and fold. The expected payoffs are as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|
! You bluff !! You don't bluff
|-
! Opponent calls 
| &lt;math&gt;20 \times {1 \over 12} - 10 \times {11 \over 12} \approx -$7.50&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;20 \times {1 \over 12} \approx $1.67&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Opponent checks or folds
| &lt;math&gt;$10&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;10 \times {1 \over 12} \approx $0.83&lt;/math&gt;
|}

If you bluff and your opponent calls, you will win $20 some of the time but lose $10 the majority of the time, so you end up with a negative expectation (the wost outcome here). If you bluff and your opponent folds you win $10 every time, giving you the best outcome here. Not bluffing gives a much lower expectation, but on the other hand it can't be negative, since you'll never put money into the pot with a hand that risks losing.

The trouble is, if we assume that your opponent is smart and knows the way you play, he can always choose the option that makes your expectation the worst: if you bluff he'll call you, but if you don't bluff he'll check or fold. If you assume that your opponent reads you correctly, then the best you can expect to make from this is 83 cents. Other than playing stupider opponents, there's no way around this.

But hold on: you can actually do better than this, if you notice that you have more than just the two options mentioned above (always bluff or never bluff). Suppose you bluff with probability &lt;math&gt;1 \over 20&lt;/math&gt;. If your opponent always folds to a bet, then you make more than if you hadn't bluffed:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{Expected gain} = 10 \times {1 \over 12} + 10 \times {1 \over 20} \times {11 \over 12} \approx $1.29
&lt;/math&gt;

If your opponent calls all your bets, then you still do better:

&lt;math&gt;
\text{Expected gain} = 20 \times {1 \over 12} - 10 \times {1 \over 20} \times {11 \over 12} \approx $1.21
&lt;/math&gt;

Your opponent will choose to call rather than fold to your bets, since this minimizes your gain (and his loss), but notice that this is a much better outcome than the 83 cents you would average if you never bluffed. To optimize your expectation, you want to choose your bluffing probability so that your opponent's loss is the same whichever of the two options he chooses. It doesn't matter how well your opponent knows you or how well he has read your hand, he can't worsen your expected gain by his choice of action.

== The semi-bluff ==
''Semi-bluffing'' is a less well understood but vital concept.  A semi-bluff is when you bet a draw to the hand that will win the pot, but you do not have anything yet.  For example, suppose you are playing hold 'em with:

[[Image:Poker-sm-235-Td.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-236-9d.png|80px|border]]

The turn comes:

[[Image:Poker-sm-23A-5d.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-241-Ac.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-219-6s.png|80px|border]] [[Image:Poker-sm-232-Kd.png|80px|border]]

You are very unlikely to have the best hand as it stands. You have four cards to a flush, with around a 20% chance to hit your flush on the next card. If the pot is very small (say against a single opponent) you may not be getting sufficient odds to make a call profitable. However, if you judge that the other player has a 20% chance of believing you have a pair of aces to his pair of kings and folding, the combined expected gain of either making your opponent fold, or making your hand if he doesn't, may make the bet profitable.

To simplify the math, we will assume that if you hit your flush you will win the pot without any further betting, and if you miss your flush but your opponent stays in you will check and fold on the river. We will also simplify the probability of hitting your flush to &lt;math&gt;1 \over 5&lt;/math&gt;, and assume that your opponent will not raise your bet.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\text{expected gain} &amp; = (\text{size of pot}) \times P(\text{opponent folds}) \\ 
&amp; \qquad + (\text{size of pot}) \times P(\text{opponent calls and you make your flush})  \\
&amp; \qquad - (\text{size of bet}) \times P(\text{opponent calls and you miss your flush}) \\
&amp; = (\text{size of pot}) \times \left [ P(\text{opponent folds}) + P(\text{opponent calls}) \times {1 \over 5} \right ] \\
&amp; \qquad - (\text{size of bet}) \times P(\text{opponent calls}) \times {4 \over 5} \\
&amp; = (\text{size of pot}) \times \left [ p + (1 - p) \times {1 \over 5} \right ] - (\text{size of bet}) \times (1 - p) \times {4 \over 5} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that your opponent folds given the hand and community cards he's faced with, then &lt;math&gt;(1 - p)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that he will call, since we've assumed he will not raise. Observe that the value of this is dependent on the value of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, which you obviously don't know since you can't see your opponent's hand. However, if you estimate that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is high enough, then the value above will become positive and the semi-bluff will become a profitable play.

For another example, I am again betting $5 into a $10 pot.  You again have top pair with an ace kicker, and I have the nuts (best) flush draw.  Here however, I do not need you to fold 33% of the time.  Even assuming you fold should I hit my flush (rather than pay me more money - implied odds), I now only need you to fold around 25% of the time for my move to be +ve, and thus profitable in the long run.

Bluffing most often now happens in two distinct ways — the BIG bluff, and the small bluff. A continuation bet where you have missed the flop completely is a small bluff. 

Aggressive players will semi bluff a lot more than they make straight out bluffs.  The fact that once you hit you may still get more money from your opponent is a large part of this, and makes the semi bluff a powerful move in any player's arsenal.

Futur Proche in French

== Usage of Near Future ==

This tense is used to speak about something happening in the very near future, as an alternative to either the future anterior (le futur antérieur) or the simple future (le futur simple).

== Formation of the Near Future ==

This tense uses a combination of the verb to go (aller) in its present indicative form appropriate to the subject followed by the infinitive of the verb that will be done.

* Je vais faire du shopping.   I will go shopping, I am going shopping. (I '''am going to do''' the shopping.)

* Nous allons jouer au foot.   We will play football.

'''First-Aid Preparedness'''

The information covered by the Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class Scout first-aid requirements can help you deal with injuries or illnesses that may arise while you are camping.  The current edition of the ''Boy Scout Handbook'' includes descriptions of the symptoms and treatment of hypothermia, heatstroke heat exhaustion, frostbite, dehydration, sunburn insect stings, tick bites, snakebite, and blisters.  Review those pages to refresh your awareness and ability to help prevent these situations from occurring.  Know the symptoms and be ready to make an appropriate response if you encounter them in a fellow hiker or someone else you meet along the way.


'''Altitude Sickness'''

Camping may take you to high places where ''altitude sickness'' (also known as ''AMS'', or ''Acute Mountain Sickness'') can be a concern.  Fortunately, altitude sickness is seldom a problem for people at elevations of less than 8,000 feet above sea level.

Going to a place that is higher than you are accustomed may leave you short of breath because the atmosphere around you becomes thinner and contains less oxygen.  Within a few days, your body will ''acclimate'' to higher altitudes by producing extra red blood cells to carry more oxygen to your tissues and organs, and you should feel fine.

Taking steps to help prevent altitude sickness is far better than suffering from it during a hike.  The following suggestions can make your &quot;high&quot; adventure more comfortable and more fun, too.


-'''Drink plenty of fluids.''' As a rule, take in enough water so that your urine remains clear rather than dark yellow.

-'''Ascend gradually.''' Permit your body to acclimate gradually as you go higher.  Spend a few days at 5,000 to 7,000 feet and then a few more at 8,000 to 10,000 feet.

-'''&quot;Climb high, sleep low.&quot;''' Use this standard practice of mountaineers.  While adjusting to thinner air, after hiking upward during the day, decend to a lower camp for a good night's rest.

- '''It is also more difficult to boil the higher you go'''  so if you don't need to go up higher , cook low it saves gas. 


'''WARNING SIGNS'''

Watch for any of all of these symptoms of altitude sickness:

- Headache

- Nausea

- Unusual tiredness

- Loss of motivation


These symptoms can also be warning signs of ''hypothermia,'' a far more common first-aid emergency among hikers.  Begin treatment for hypothermia by making sure that the person is warm, is wearing dry clothing, is sheltered from the wind and chilly or wet weather, and has had enough to eat and drink.  If the person does not rapidly improve and the elevation is above 8,000 feet, treat for altitude sickness as well.


'''TREATMENT FOR ALTITUDE SICKNESS'''

''Descend, descend, descend!'' Going down a few thousand feet in elevation will almost always relieve the symptoms of altitude sickness. Rest, fluids, and food may also help.  If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical assistance.

This is a document I am building up during the time I spend on Wikibooks. It mostly consists of a collection of current problems with the Wikibooks system, some solutions to these problems, and some provisional policies to help implement these solutions. Many of the problems and solutions listed here are ones which I have read from other users on the hundreds of talk pages on Wikibooks, and some are ones I have personally discovered. I have not distinguished between the two, since they are still problems for everyone, regardless of who identified them.

This will almost certainly remain a work-in-progress for the foreseeable future, and consequently may be internally inconsistent. I don't mind if other users make minor edits to correct obvious typos, but more substantial changes and other comments are more welcome on the [[User talk:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks|talk page]].

== Abstract ==

Wiki is an ephemeral community in the sense that many of its users don't remain active for very long. There are a hardcore of long-term residents, but they are comparatively few in numbers. Basically, at any one time, there is an active community, but the members of it change quickly over time. Any procedures must bear this in mind, especially in the sense that it can take a long time to get any meaningful feedback from another user, so some users are being held back by the occasional desolation of pages such as [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]. Consequently, I think standards need to be more pro-active, rather than discussional (i.e. the procedure would favour the writers own passion for the subject).

Many of the pages here remind me of the hilarious scene from [[w:Life of Brian|Life of Brian]], where the inactive 'activists' known as the ''People's Front of Judea'' suddenly learn that one of their number is to be crucified, and are informed to come quickly to help, by which their leader passionately declares, &quot;This calls for immediate discussion!&quot;. We need to define certain common issues which occur (e.g. VfD), and come up with better criteria, to minimize the amount of discussion required. All the time wasted on discussion is perhaps time that could have been spent writing good educational content. I think it's mostly due to users being too scared to [[m:be bold|be bold]].

== The goal of Wikibooks ==

First of all, I should define the goal of Wikibooks. The first definition I can find is the first meaningful revision of the [[Main page]] made on 10th July 2003. It states:

* The '''Wikimedia Free Textbook Project''' intends to cooperatively write textbooks of various fields and topics.

The same page currently (almost exactly two years later) states:

* Welcome to '''[[Wikibooks:About|Wikibooks]]''', a collection of [[Why use open textbooks?|open-content]] textbooks that [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|'''anyone&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;edit''']].

Pretty much the same meaning, so that much seems clear. Moving on to [[Wikibooks:About]], we are told:

* '''Wikibooks''' is a collection of [[w:Free content|free]] [[w:textbook|textbook]]s with supporting book-based texts, that is being written collaboratively on this website.

Note that the word 'textbooks' is linked to the Wikipedia entry for that word, so we can only assume that this entry is an adequate definition for the types of content permitted on this site. The Wikipedia page appears to begin with a brief dictionary-length definition:

* '''Textbooks''' are defined as &quot;''a manual of instruction, a standard book in any branch of study''&quot;. They are further defined by both the age of the person who is to study the text and the classification of the subject matter itself. Textbooks are published by speciality printers to serve every request for an understanding of every subject that can be taught. It is a big business that requires mass volume sales to make the publications profitable. Although most textbooks are only published in printed format with hard covers, some can now be viewed online.

To be fair, the NPOV policy means it's fair to look at other dictionary definitions:

* A book used in schools or colleges for the formal study of a subject.
* A volume, as of some classical author, on which a teacher lectures or comments; hence, any manual of instruction; a schoolbook.

There seems to be a common connection with the academic establishments, so it would seem that anything commonly used there ought to be appropriate. e.g.:

* Generalized books about a traditional academic discipline, such as:
** Languages (English, French, etc.)
** Mathematics
** Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.)
** etc.
* More specific books, but still commonly used by students:
** Dictionaries/encyclopedias specific to a single discipline (e.g. a dictionary of medical terms).
** In-depth guides, often crossing into multiple disciplines (e.g. electronics is also generally covered in physics and computer science courses)
** Biographies of famous people in a particular discipline (e.g. Shakespeare), perhaps with annotated texts. These are commonly used in disciplines such as history, and literature, but generalized to include any famous person in a particular discipline.

More generally, the following types of content seem to be allowed:

* Guides to computer games (lots of these, not traditionally used in any academic subjects)
* Recipe book (arguably a 'textbook' in a 'home economics' or 'cooking' course)

I consider these to be perfectly valid. Perhaps 'students' should be extended with 'enthusiasts'. Who else is going to be reading these books? My own opinion is that any book you'd find in the 'non-fiction' section of a library (i.e. those which have a dewey decimal classification) ought to be allowed.

These are commonly denied:

* 'Fiction' - Basically, any book you'd expect to find in the 'fiction' section of your local library, as opposed to the 'non-fiction' section. There is currently no official Wikimedia wiki for this sort of content.

Thinking about it, since Wikibooks is currently host to Wikiversity and Wikijunior projects, then anything in that scope ought to be okay, providing it is clearly marked as such. It's possible Wikijunior may allow educational fiction? Are these books allowed?

* [[An_Unexpected_Visitor]] - Not listed on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]
* [[Ardvark_the_Aardvark]] - Listed on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]

These are always denied, because they belong on a sister project:

* Ephemeral (news) articles. These belong on Wikinews.
* A book of quotations. These belong on Wikiquote
* A book about the taxonomic classification of species. This belongs on Wikispecies.
* A generalized encyclopedia. This belongs on Wikipedia.
* A generalized dictionary. This belongs on Wiktionary.
* Previously published works by another author, with no intention of annotating the text. These belong on Wikisource.

== Common problems ==

The idea is to gradually convert this section into some simple procedures which serve to eliminate them.

=== Unreliable administrative system ===

'''Note''': This section should not be interpreted as a perjorative statement about actual Wikibooks administrators, but rather a statement about the 'system' in which they act. The actual administrators tend to do their jobs well, but there just aren't enough of them. See also [[#Badly defined scope for acceptable content|Badly defined scope for acceptable content]] and [[#NPOV (Neutral Point Of View)|NPOV (Neutral Point Of View)]].

There has always been an issue that some users will create non-NPOV material or other meaningless nonsense in the main namespace. Due to the current open nature of the Wikibooks project, there is no way to prevent this. Only an administrator can delete these pages, and in order for them to do so without getting into trouble, the pages must go through a voting process (i.e. [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]), with the exception of obvious [[Wikibooks:Glossary#vandalism|vandalism]] and [[Wikibooks:Glossary#newbie experiment|newbie experiments]]. Consequently, the administrative system only really works where there are a sufficient number of users participating in these votes, and enough active administrators to get things sorted out in a reasonable amount of time.

Until this is sorted out, it's most practical to pretend there are no administrators, and to find solutions which any user is capable of implementing. There are murmurings on Meta to address this too. Looking at the latest beta of MediaWiki, if seems as if a new voting system is being worked on as well, although this may be for a different purpose.

Also, there has always been the general feeling that a user's pages (e.g. [[User:Aya]] and [[User talk:Aya]]), and any subpages thereof do not have to be NPOV, and that the user may maintain a strict editorial control of those pages. For example if I were to add the comment &quot;Some users believe this user to be a complete ass&quot; to a user's personal page, it couldn't really be argued to be non-NPOV, but changes of this nature are generally reverted.

; Solutions

The obvious solution would be to allow this non-NPOV material providing it's housed in the originating user's own pages, and in fact many users already do this, to start work on a community project, before it is ready to be transferred to the main namespace, and continued by the community.

This is the paradigm I have tried to propagate, and in the process, I have separated these projects on the [[Main page]] into &quot;Community Projects&quot; and &quot;Personal Projects&quot;. As to whether or not these personal pages deserve to be linked from the main page is another issue, but if they are ultimately intended to become community projects, I don't see this as a problem, since it helps the material to become more NPOV, by allowing other users to comment on it.

=== Newbies ===

Newbies experimenting with the system, unaware of the damage they are causing.

; Solutions

The current [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] solution really only allows them to experiment with editing a single page. This is by no means the entire scope of the wiki-experience. They may still accidentally create loads of pages that just need to be cleaned up later. Perhaps they want to experiment with the &quot;move page&quot; feature on an important page. Perhaps they've been directed here from another site, and have no idea what it's all about. Get them off the site, and onto a safe sandbox site ASAP. Arguably there should be a link in the 'navigation' panel just for newbies. Try to direct them to another Wiki system to play around in like a beta version. In fact, they are the ideal candidates to thoroughly test the error-cases for the MediaWiki software, so getting them to help beta-test the next version would be a bonus.

* Suggested sandbox wiki: http://test.leuksman.com/index.php/Main_Page
* Controlled by [[m:User:Brion VIBBER]] (allegedly)

If that site can be guaranteed to remain up 24/7, that's exactly what we need. If we can get the DNS name sandbox.wikimedia.org to point to the same IP address, and co-ordinate with the developers to ensure that this site always contains the latest bleeding-edge release of MediaWiki, we can get some free beta-testers, while minimizing site damage. We also need to make sure all WikiMedia sites include this link. This could prove more difficult, since there are hundreds of them.

=== Vandals ===

Vandals, intent on deliberately sabotaging the site.

; Solutions

User blocks and IP blocks help, but we could never stop a determined vandal without seriously compromising the ease of use of the site for the genuine contributor. The only real solution seems to be for other users to keep their eyes open, and regularly check out the 'Recent changes' list. Perhaps a formalisation of this process would help.

=== Unnoticed vandalism / newbie experiments === 

If a page is not obviously covered with nonsense, but content has been removed, or changed to be incorrect, no one may spot it, and the offending changes will not be reverted. A future editor may not spot it either, and make their additions. The more edits which then subsequently occur, the more awkward it will be to reverse the damage.

This can be quite irritating. You can't just revert back to the version prior to the damage, since you would be accused of vandalising the page yourself by removing the content of subsequent edits.

; Solutions

Two possibilities come to mind, one changing software, the other wetware (i.e. the brain):

* We could implement a system allowing you to reverse-apply the context-diffs from the offending edit or range of edits, with a single click, where possible, in the same way that CVS automatically merges in changes made by other users, while you are editing a document (this would also be neat). The offending edits will remain in the history, but a new revision will be added which appears as if you removed the offending edits by hand. This will not be possible in all cases, but would work with many common offenses such as linkspamming and blanking of sections.

* We could make the user more responsible for the complete document they submit, rather than just the edits they've made. So, if you want to edit a page, you must first revert any vandalism before you add anything new. If you don't, you'll be considered a vandal yourself, and might get your account/IP blocked. Do people feel this is too harsh?

=== Policy visibility ===

A potential author, wanting to 'play by the rules', but can't/won't look to see what the rules are.

; Solutions

The rules/standards/policies/whatever pages need to be much more visible. Not currently sure as to the best implementation for this. The page [[Help:Editing]] is quite visible, since it's linked to from every edit page. Perhaps this should contain a warning that the user should check out the site policies before continuing, if they wish to avoid the possibility that their edits will be reverted or deleted by another user. 

=== Badly defined scope for acceptable content ===

e.g. 'no original research' from [[WB:WIN]].

Obviously a user would be wasting their time, as well as the admin's time, to add something which is only going to be subsequently deleted.

; Solutions

Can people please forget about the phrase 'no original research', and mentally revert it to the original 'no primary research' (less vague), or even something even less vague. See also: [[User talk:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#Be bold]]. I'll wait to see if [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] wants to sort it out before I change anything.

'Primary research' refers to the sorts of theses published by graduate students to propose a genuinely new theory. It would be used, perhaps, to refer to, say, ''Newton's Laws of Universal Gravitation'', at any point prior to it being commonly accepted in Physics. These theses often involve coining new words and word-phrases which are not commonly used elsewhere, in order to refer to the new concepts they describe. There's nothing wrong with this, per se, but if everyone did it, then the language use could easily become too confusing to be of any practical benefit. (q.v. [[Neo]]). This is the primary reason that these things should not be allowed. Surely, devising a strategy for a mission in, say, GTA:SA, is 'original research' and 'primary research' in the sense that you have devised it yourself. The important distinction is that it is done using commonplace terms (within its own scope), and is focused on a very popular computer game (the bestselling of all time IIRC), rather that some wacky new theory that someone like Eddie Izzard might come up with, say, that bees are actually made of jam.

Personally I don't have a problem with this stuff either, and arguably it has sneaked in to a lot of other documents already. In fact, I'd go as far to say that I interpret almost everything I read as 'primary research', unless it clearly fits in with 'common sense', which I will define as the sorts of things commonly taught in schools. So [[Physics]] is almost certainly not 'primary research', whereas the mission walkthroughs section of [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] almost certainly is.

Maybe the policy should be phrased &quot;this site should only contain factual infomation&quot;, with the standard dictionary definition of 'factual', then allow memetic evolution to allow the users to decide what that actually is. Arguably this appears to be the common goal of all Wikimedia projects. The policy would allow any user to correct/revert/delete anything which has been agreed to not be 'factual'. I've tried to avoid using the term 'fictional', since this has different connotations than simply being the antithesis of 'factual'.

=== NPOV (Neutral Point Of View) ===

See: [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]]
See also the much more comprehensive [[w:Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]].

Would it be sufficient to link the former to the latter?

Arguably, just a special case of the previous problem. Based on some lengthy discussions from other users in the past, and my own interpretation, I think this requires a better definition.

; What is a 'neutral point of view' anyway?

To think from a neutral point of view, to me, almost requires you to imagine you are an alien visitor from another planet, trying to make an objective analysis of the human race, and their beliefs and customs.

; Bias

Take the more biased point of view:

* Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

If you see that in a Wikibooks module, and do not agree, just remember you should really interpret that as:

* The user who wrote this believes that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

So you could replace it with:

* At least one person believes that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

But since it's likely that any opinion is shared between at least a few people, you could also word it with the more vague:

* Some people believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

If you're vaguely aware of the statistics, you could even replace it with one of:

* Most people believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.
* Most people don't believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

And if you happen to know the exact statistic (I just made this statistic up):

* 63% of people believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

Note that now, you are primarily talking about people, not an operating system.

; True by definition

What about this:

* A human being is a mammal.

Again, you could apply the same logic as the previous example, but it would seem a bit ridiculous to do so. You'd probably end up with:

* More than 99% of people believe that a human being is a mammal.

The difference here is that this statement is 'true by definition'. That is that the word-phrase 'human being' is defined in most dictionaries to include it within the bounds for the definition of the word 'mammal', at least as long as the species retains its mamma. This is not the case for the MS Windows example, at least not in any dictionaries I've ever read.

; Ambiguous statements

Back to the MS Windows example:

* Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

In addition to bias, it also suffers from ambiguity. How is the word 'best' defined within this context? To keep it vaguely factual, I'd probably intepret that as:

* Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system.

That is to say used by the most people. This is a common definition of 'best' within a similar context, but others might interpret it as:

* Microsoft Windows is the most stable and user-friendly operating system.

At which point it becomes slightly more contentious. Probably best to avoid the word 'best' anyway. :-)

; But, 'I believe'

What if the user had instead written:

* I believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

Well. It's hardly a neutral point of view, but arguably, shouldn't be deleted, but (as before) replaced with:

* Some people believe that Microsoft Windows is the best operating system.

Thus making it neutral.

=== Indecisive deletion policy ===

It's actually a good idea to bring suspect pages into 'Staff lounge', rather than just adding them to VfD. If something is contentious enough to warrant a VfD, then perhaps it needs to be discussed first to ensure everyone interprets it in the same way. Consequently many VfD's end up forever in voting while the users try to see if they are 'on the same wavelength'.

=== [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] ===

It's akin to a talk page, but it has far too broad a scope for what is acceptable there. Consequently, the page invariably becomes massive, there are no standards for when the archive the page, and it ends up being too overwhelming for new users.

; Solutions

A set of pages in the same vein, only more akin to the popular web-forum convention of subdividing different topics into different pages. Provisional subdivisions (incomplete):

* General forum - A place for all questions which don't neatly fit into any other category. Questions could be moved at a later date, but this may be offputting to 
* Wiki markup forum - For questions relating to wiki markup, and the correct use of HTML on a wiki.
* Votes for deletion - This is in effect a talk pages already. Adding it to a list of these forum-like talk pages could only serve to make it more visible.
* Votes for undeletion - Ditto

=== Stub books ===

It's important to distinguish more objectively the differences between books, modules, and pages. It seems that many are interpreting a 'book' to mean the same as 'an article on Wikipedia'. I guess they're similar, but modules should be reserved for things beyond the scope of Wikipedia (although this is also poorly defined - perhaps it should be &quot;anything more than 32k of text on as many subpages as you like&quot;). 

=== Bookshelves out-of-date ===

See: [[All bookshelves]], etc.

These should be updated to link to the main page of all new books. These indices are already inaccurate, and need an overhaul. Create more taxonomical and normative categories to remove duplicated entries. Make it obvious which pages represent the main page of a distinct book.

The definitive book listing ought to be one where everyone can agree where books go. For this reason, I suggest using the [[w:Dewey Decimal Classification]], since it was created entirely for this purpose, and is extremely comprehensive.

Someone has already made a start with:

* [[Template:Dewey 000]]
* [[Template:Dewey 100]]
* [[Template:Dewey 200]]
* [[Template:Dewey 300]]
* [[Template:Dewey 400]]
* [[Template:Dewey 500]]
* [[Template:Dewey 600]]
* [[Template:Dewey 700]]
* [[Template:Dewey 800]]
* [[Template:Dewey 900]]

The dewey index page at page site http://isbndb.com/ could be useful.

; Problems

The dewey system is not quite standard across the world. It is apparently the most internationally recognised, but at least the section pertainting to religion varies depending on the most popular (government-imposed?) religion in that country. The DDC was written by a US citizen, so most of the religion section is devoted solely to Christianity (too much of it in my view), whilst a very small subsection is provided for alternate religions and ideologies. In countries where Christianity is not the primary religion, the vast majority of this section is devoted to the primary religion, and the smaller subsection is used for Christianity and other religions.

Another problem is with evolution. The DDC is not designed to evolve well. The generalities section (circa dewey 000) generally houses books pertaining to computers. I have also seen these classified in the physics and maths section in some libraries (circa dewey 500). As computers become more important in our day-to-day lives, these books will become increasingly common and popular.

The existent bookshelf alternative may prove to be be more successful in the long term. Its top-level categories are almost identical to those of the DDC system already. Furthermore, it is better able to evolve than the DDC. Perhaps DDC is not such a great idea after all.

=== [[Main page]] out-of-date ===

See: [[Talk:Main Page]]

=== [[Wikibooks:Browse]] out-of-date ===

Also it contains many red links, which is generally a bad thing.

=== Stub pages ===

I'm not sure why people have a problem with this. It seems reasonable to me that a user may take several days to try to get all their content into a meaningful place, so these should be permitted to exist for at least a certain amount of time.

=== Skeletons ===

A ''skeleton'' is a Wikibook which consists of a contents page linked to many other non-existent pages. The user who creates them will often be overwhelmed by the size of the scope they have created for themself to fill in, and often abandon the project. Newbies also have a tendency to click on these links, and type in any old nonsense.

; Solutions

Need a good ''policy'' on starting new books. By having a stricter policy, the endless debates in VfD can be minimised. The important thing is that the policy should try to leave the book in a reasonable state at all times, since almost every book is abandoned by its authors before it can be considered complete. See: [[#New book policy|New book policy]]

=== Scope overlap with other wikis ===

Scope overlap with Wikipedia, and forking from Wikipedia.

; Solutions

Make a more tight definition as to the distinction between Wikipedia and Wikibooks. It's obvious that there's going to be crossover, so for subject X:

* If you can't be bothered to put in the effort to create a good book about X:
** If there is a Wikipedia article about X, add it to that
** If not, create a new Wikipedia article about X
* If you can be bothered to put in the effort to create a good book:
** If there is a Wikipedia article already about X, make sure your book contains at least the information present there
** Note heavily on the Wikipedia article that a book now exists on the subject, and all new information should be put there

I shall define a good book to mean one which has more content than is generally acceptable for a Wikipedia article (probably around 32k of text).

Where an extensive and popular Wikipedia article already exists with the same name, I see nothing wrong with forking the content from there, providing it is noted heavily in the Wikipedia article 

=== Double redirects ===

Are they really a problem? Need to check this out.

=== Orphaned pages ===

Including orphaned redirect pages. These are mostly redundant, and are just taking up unneccesary space. Should be speedily deleted.

=== Inconsistent use of capitalization ===

Wiki page names are ''case-sensitive'', so one user can create a book &quot;A history of computers&quot;, and another could create a book &quot;A History of Computers&quot;, and they may never notice they're both writing the same book. Are title caps preferable? Needs to be standardized, or maybe they shouldn't be case sensitive? The problem below is similar.

=== Inconsistent use of naming ===

Similar to the above, what about the two book names &quot;Computing History&quot; and &quot;A History of Computing&quot;, or the endless conceivable permutations which are logically the same concept. Wikipedia simply uses redirects. Is this appropriate for Wikibooks too? Would these all be listed of the bookshelves?

=== Inconsistent use of talk pages ===

Mostly they talk about the page they belong to, but there are the odd cases such as pages like [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] which is a talk page in its own right. Also check out the way they've been used in [[Christianity/John 1]], and similar pages.

; Solutions

I believe the logical distinction between a page and its associated talk page is that the page should serve as the information, and the talk page should serve as the reasoning why the information is the way it is. In a way, this reasoning is vital for preventing an edit war of the information page. For works-in-progress, you often see this reasoning in the information page itself. This practise should not be discouraged.

For pages like [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] where the informational page is effectively being used as a talk page, perhaps the actual talk page could be used to keep presentable infomation on the ways things are done within that page (i.e. the two pages are conceptually swapped over), although I supposed it could also be used as a meta-talk page. It just seems a bit silly to talk about talking on a different page, when it could all be said on the main page.

As for [[Christianity/John 1]] etc., this practise ought to be frowned upon. It has already appeared in VfD. This is a special case which needs to be tightened up in the annotated texts policy. In my opinion, the main page should not be allowed to exist alone, since it is clearly raw text from the Bible. The talk pages should perhaps be appended to the main page, then cleared, since Wikipedians currently have no place to comment on the content of the page.

=== Archiving talk pages ===

Talk pages, and other pages which serve a similar function have a tendency to get long, and contain discussions which are no longer being monitored by anybody.

=== The 32k page limit ===

What browsers actually have a problem with this? If it really is a problem, it should be addressed in policy.

== Provisional policies and guidelines ==

This is an attempt to standardize, in the style of [[w:nomic|nomic]], what is currently popular convention, in the hopes of converting Wikibooks in something more akin to [[w:direct democracy|direct democracy]] rather than [[w:anarchy|anarchy]]. Another analogy would be perhaps the ''U.S. Constitution'', and its ''Amendments'', although this is [[w:representative democracy|representative democracy]] not direct democracy. The goal is to prevent [[w:edit wars|edit wars]], amongst other things.

=== Outline ===

; Use of terminology

What's a good word for documents of this nature? &quot;Policy&quot; seems to be the wiki standard, as well as &quot;guideline&quot; for more trivial things. It may be worth promoting all guidelines to policies anyway. If people interpret &quot;policy&quot; as &quot;I must do this&quot;, and &quot;guideline&quot; as &quot;I might do this&quot;, then guidelines would clearly be more effective if they were labelled &quot;policies&quot;. The psychological interpretation of language is a key point. Perhaps the word &quot;procedure&quot; is better, since it infers activity, rather than politics.

; Main page

* [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]] - This page should contain no actual ''policies'', but instead serve as a useful index to all other ''policy documents''. The definitive index should always be the templated categories. This page will also contain ''guidelines''.

; Policy documents

* [[Wikibooks:Core policies]] - This will contain meta-policies, which are those to serve to indicate how policies are created/modified/removed, but can also be used for policies which don't require a whole document on the subject.

* [[Wikibooks:Editing policy]] - As it is.

etc.

; Alternatives

Maybe the problem is simply that by breaking up the policies into separate documents, users are too lazy to read them, since each page can take a long time to load. Based on the overheads of HTML and HTTP, it is certainly true to say a single larger document will be quicker to load than several smaller ones. Perhaps a single page is better, although each section may have to be extremely terse to make it digestable.

Since there seems to be a lot of policy forking going on between wikis, maybe the whole lot should be copied to meta and deleted from all sites, including policy for individual projects such as Wikibooks and Wikipedia.

; Visibility

I'm thinking of those signs you see on trash bins that say &quot;keep &lt;locale&gt; tidy&quot;; the ''locale'' of course depends on where you happen to be at the time. An image of that, but reading &quot;keep wikibooks tidy&quot; to splat on various pages, assuming we can link it to an appropriate page.

=== How to write effective policy documents ===

; Know your audience

This is en.wikibooks.org, so users here are most likely going to be countries with a large English-speaking population, with reasonable internet access. Using [[w:List_of_official_languages]] and [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html the CIA factbook]:

* India (1,080,264,388 - also Hindi)
* USA (295,734,134 - ~82.1%)
* Pakistan (162,419,946 - &lt;8%)
* Nigeria (128,765,768)
* Philippines (87,857,473 - also Filipino)
* UK (60,441,457)
* South Africa (44,344,136 - ~8.2% - also many others)
* Kenya (33,829,590 - also Swahili)
* Canada (32,805,041 - ~59.3% - also French)
* Australia (20,090,437 - ~79.1%)
* Hong Kong (6,898,686)
* Papua New Guinea (5,545,268 - &lt;2%)
* Singapore (4,425,720 - ~23% - also many others)
* New Zealand (4,035,461 - also Maori)
* Republic of Ireland (4,015,676 - also Irish)

Number in brackets is total population, which is not necessarily the same as English-speaking. Countries less than 2 million people not listed. This list is no indication of internet access. Also, some countries languages are not official languages by law, but only by custom. This distinction is irrelevant within the scope of this document.

; Use unambigious language

Technically impossible, since all people interpret language slightly differently, but bear it in mind. Some useful tricks are:

* Link the word to a definition in [[Wikibooks:Glossary]], and tighten the definition in there.
* Link the word to a page in Wikipedia. Many words and word-phrases already have disambiguation pages there, so this may also get the point across.

; Use examples

So, for example, when describing the correct use of naming, give an example of a book that conforms. This may be far more meaningful than any amount of explanation could ever achieve.

; The 'wall-of-text' effect

When faced with a huge paragraph, people tend to only read the first couple of sentences, then let their mind fill in the rest. Short, bulled pointed sentences are much easier to digest. Use whitespace to break things up, and try to make policies terse, while their justification can be as verbose as is necessary to justify that policy.

; The Bible Metaphor

Easily one of the most influential books in western civilization, and in many ways is like an early version of the, now commonplace, legislative set of rules comprising the ''social contract''. I'm not sure if the 11th commandment was ever intended to be &quot;Thou shalt not infringe on intellectual property rights.&quot;, but that seems to be the way things have become.

It memetic popularity can be attributed to its use of two distinct psychological tools. The first is wording it to make readers believe that they will suffer the torment of burning in eternal damnation if they don't read and follow the rules. The second is wording it to encourage the reader to propagate the meme to the minds of other people.

The practical wiki-equivalent of eternal damnation, would be things like blocking user accounts and IP addresses, and having contributions deleted or reverted. Obviously, only the latter can be performed by a regular user, and since there are relatively few admins at the moment, this may prove to be the most effective deterrent.

; The Selfish Gene &amp; Prisoner's Dilemma Metaphor

The psychological effect of wording the rules, to imply that a positive consequence will occur to the user who follows them, will serve better than to imply that a positive consequence will occur to the remainder of the Wikibooks community. In short, you get better results by appealing to an individual's sense of ''selfishness'' than to their sense of ''altruism''.

=== Core policies ===

; Definition of terms 

This is extremely important. In order to communicate unambiguously, we need to agree on the same terminology. [[Wikibooks:Glossary]] is a good starting point for this.

; Current policy definitions

I had already added some of this to [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]], and created the templates [[Template:Enforced]], [[Template:Proposed]], [[Template:Rejected]] to make it more similar to Wikipedia, but perhaps it was not such a good idea. I shall refrain from making any further changes until this is sorted out.

There are three kinds of ''policy'':

* ''Enforced policy'' - This will be enforced by the Wikibook community.
* ''Proposed policy'' - This is a policy proposed to be an ''enforced policy'', but is still undergoing discussion.
* ''Rejected policy'' - This is a ''proposed policy'' which has been rejected by the community. It should remain to remind people why it was rejected.

When the term ''policy'' is used without one of these qualifiers, it is assumed to mean ''enforced policy''.

A ''guideline'' is the much less formal equivalent of a policy. They generally don't require enforcement, because they're mostly obvious social behavioural guidelines in various situations. If they become problematic in the future, they may be promoted to a full policy document.

; Existing systems

Perhaps we should use the the standards from RFC2119, since they are more tight definitions of commonplace English words:

# MUST - This word, or the terms &quot;REQUIRED&quot; or &quot;SHALL&quot;, mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
# MUST NOT - This phrase, or the phrase &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
# SHOULD - This word, or the adjective &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
# SHOULD NOT - This phrase, or the phrase &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot; mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.
# MAY - This word, or the adjective &quot;OPTIONAL&quot;, mean that an item is truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item. An implementation which does not include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the same vein an implementation which does include a particular option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the option provides.)

Translated into wiki, this would mean that breaking 1 and 2 would be grounds for banning, 3 and 4 would be grounds for reverting/page renaming/merging, and 5 is just a suggestion.

e.g.

* You MUST NOT vandalise pages.
* You SHOULD sign posts on a talk page.
* You MAY write a new book. :-)

In a way, a wiki is a much better system for &quot;Requests For Comments (RFCs)&quot;, since each page has a talk page precisely for this purpose. Maybe this would be a better metaphor, but it might confuse it with the IETF documents on which it was based.

On the subject of RFCs, the success of the internet tend to suggest the IETF did a good job with writing those documents. They are very precise, and some are so well written, you could have a hard job arguing with them, except perhaps if you beg to differ on the definition of a fundamental principle like an &quot;electron&quot;.

; Provision nomic-esque policies

I will have to change these:

* Every core policy is mutable (i.e. it can be changed).
** ''No legal system can adapt to the changing nature of the universe without being flexible.''
* Every core policy must have at least one justification.
** ''The [[w:tragedy of the commons|tragedy of the commons]] effect would suggest that people are far less likely to follow standards without adequate justification.''
** ''It will prevent newbies from asking, &quot;why is X a policy?&quot;''
* The process for changing the core policies should be by submitting the proposed changes to its talk page. The voting process begins at this time. Each registered user gets one vote, either 'for' or 'against'. The user may in addition specify a justification for their vote, even though it may have the secondary consequence of persuading subsequent voters to vote the same way. The voting period will last for one week. After this time, if the number of 'for' votes is greater than or equal to the number of 'against' votes, the change is considered accepted, and the user who proposed the change may now apply it to the appropriate page. This includes the case where there are no votes at all.
** ''By specifying a time limit for voting, things can still happen even when the site is rarely visited.''

; Issues to resolve

* Is one week a good length of time to allow for voting?
* Should we have another set of less-mutable standards which require a minimum number of votes to ratify?

; Better ideas?

Anything wrong with just:

* If you think it's wrong, just change it
* If your change gets reverted, talk about it
* If you still don't agree, vote on it

Seems about as pro-active as I can think of.

=== Navigation panel policy ===

Since the navigation panel is visible on all pages (is this true for all available CSS pages?), it is a useful tool for helping people find what they are looking for, especially if they have been directed to a specific page on this site, rather than to the main page or portal. These can't be changed by regular users, so perhaps a page should be put in place to specify these links, while allowing its talk page to serve as a place to discuss what they should be. Currently they are:

* Main Page -&gt; [[Main Page]]
* Wikiversity -&gt; [[Wikiversity]]
* Community Portal -&gt; [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]]
* Recent changes -&gt; [[Special:Recentchanges]]
* Random module -&gt; [[Special:Random]]
* Help -&gt; [[Help:Contents]]
* Donations -&gt; http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Fundraising

I'm thinking one should link to a page devoted to people who are new to the wiki experience, and that this page should provide an obvious link to the sandbox wiki.

=== Book writing policy ===

''(a.k.a) How to make sure that your edits that won't get reverted by anyone, or your pages deleted by an administrator.''

Obviously, it's a complete waste of time to work on a book which will subsequently get reverted or deleted.

; Writing a new book from scratch

* Before you start a new book, check there isn't one already which covers the scope you have in mind. By adding content to an existing book (especially if you use the correct subpage convention), rather than creating a new 'stub' book, your change will more likely be accepted by the Wikibooks community, and you will be doing a 'good thing' in trying to keep similar content in the same book.

* When starting a new book, the most important thing is to choose a good title for it. Should you subsequently abandon the project, this title will in many ways determine its future scope, since it then becomes up to other users to determine what information belongs in it, based on its title.

* Once you have a title for your book, try to start out with the intention of writing everything on a single page. Perhaps start with a single paragraph to explain the scope of the book. If you don't provide even this much, your work will likely get declared to be a 'stub', and deleted at a later date. To avoid this, you generally have a lot more freedom in the sorts of content you can place in your user page, or a subpage thereof. Some users prefer to start their book as a subpage of their user page, then move it to the main namespace when they think it is of sufficient quality to 'publish'. If you start your book in the main namespace, you will more likely find that other users will edit it, and might be prepared to help out with writing it.

* As ideas for 'chapters' in the book form in your mind, start using the '==' subheading notation to subdivide it, and try to provide at least a sentence for each subheading to explain what should go in that section. Once you have at least three or four of these, the page will automatically generate a table of contents for your book. If you like, you can further subdivide with '===' sub-subheading, etc.

* Once your page reaches the point where some of the sections contain a substantial enough amount of content to warrant a whole page to the subject, then you can start playing around with subpages. Using the '''/' subpage convention'' will save you a lot of effort since it automatically provides links to its parent pages. Try to avoid creating links to pages that don't exist, these often get clicked on by newbies, who seem to think that &quot;fsghfgpouhgp&quot; is good enough for the content. Also try to avoid 'stub' pages which contain only a single sentence. Many wiki users consider these to be evil, and will often mark them for deletion, especially when they do not use the '/' subpage convention to indicate they are subpages of another book.

; Transferring existing content to form a new book

* First, make sure you are legally allowed to put the source onto the wiki at all. See: [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]]
* If the source text is already complete, and you have no intention to change it, it should be put on Wikisource instead. This site is for books in development. See also: [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]]
* If the source text needs work to convert it to use wiki markup, it might be worth temporarily housing the page as a subpage of your user page. So called [[Wikibooks:Glossary#data dump|data dumps]] are generally frowned upon.

=== Editing policy ===

* [[Wikibooks:Editing policy]]

=== Deletion policy ===

* [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]
* [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]
* [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]]

* Don't add a page to VfD unless it hasn't been edited for at least 1 week.
** ''Someone trying to build up a book from scratch may take a while to get any significant amount of content in.''

=== Namespace use policy ===

Personally I find the namespacing system to be a little inflexibile, since you can't dynamically add new ones, however, it might worth formalizing things like:

* All pages about Wikibooks itself, rather than actual books should be in the 'Wikibooks' namespace.
* Every page name in the main namespace which clearly contains no ':' and '/' to identify it as a page in a book, should be considered a 'book' in its own right.
* If that page appears to be part of another book, please rename (move) the page to use the bookname/pagename convention.
** ''Point is, if someone can't be bothered to collate the pages of their own book, they clearly need the '/' convention to provide this automatic linking for them.''

There are also some pages in the 'Help' namespace, with no clear distinction as to what belongs in that, compared to what should belong in the 'Wikibooks' namespace.

=== Page naming policy === 

* [[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]]
* [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]

; On the subject of '/' vs. '&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;'

There are two key differences between the two. The first is a simple typographical distinction, and the other is the way the wiki software behaves when rendering the page. 

Typographically, it may be preferable to use the '/' syntax since:

* It distinguishes it from the ':' used for namespaces, which operate in a different fashion, and may serve to confuse users as to their function. e.g.
** The corresponding talk page for [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] is [[Wikibooks talk:Administrators]]
** The corresponding talk page for [[Programming:C]] is not [[Programming talk:C]], but [[Talk:Programming:C]].

* It's common URL convention anyway. There are dozens of RFCs on the subject.

* On my keyboard, I don't have to press SHIFT to make one appear. Okay. A bit selfish, but I suspect that 99% of en.wikibooks.org have the same keyboard layout as me in that regard.

Behaviorally, however, the two are not nearly as equivalent, since using '/' will create a link to its parent pages, whereas ':' will not. The user may not want this link, since they may be using a far more sophisticated template page for navigation purposes. Unless there is a way to optionally suppress the link added using '/', then you can argue that both systems need to be retained for flexibility. If there is such a system, then I'd argue for the dropping of the ':' syntax, to be used solely as a means to easily identify which namespace a page is in.

There are practical considerations as well. If we do decide to use one over the other, is anyone actually going to change all the existing books to be conformant?

; On the use of hierarchy generally

There is also a great deal of flexibility in the use of hierarchy generally.

See: [[User talk:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#The dangers of hierarchies]]

=== Category use policy ===

There doesn't seem to be anything about this at the moment, and I've not really put a lot of thought into it, so I'll put in:

* Use categories at your own discretion.

As for hierarchical categories such as...

* [[:Category:Wikibooks Pokédex:Baby Pokémon]]
* [[:Category:Wikibooks Pokédex:Cute Charm Ability]]

...or the same, but using a '/' instead of a ':' - be aware that the use of these delimiters is not interpreted by the software in any way, so it is merely a typographical distinction. For the same reasons as page naming, I would suggest the use of '/' rather than ':' to avoid the confusion between concrete namespaces and artificial scopes.

As for the conceptual 'scoping' of categories using this notation, I guess it's reasonable to do so where said categories would otherwise serve to pollute the main category namespace. This may be more necessary when creating categories based on fictional universes such as Pokémon, rather than the one we actually live in. If you merely wish to provide hierarchy to real world concepts, just choose a fairly unambigious name, and use sub-categories to create hierarchy. That is, if you add a category to another category, it is considered a sub-category of that category. Implying hierarchy through the name will only make it more awkward to modify that hierarchy later. A reasonable example might be

* [[:Category:Cooking]]
** [[:Category:Recipes]] - recipes is probably unambiguous enough
*** [[:Category:Fish recipes]]
*** [[:Category:Meat recipes]]
*** [[:Category:Vegan recipes]]
** [[:Category:Kitchen equipment]]

The problem is, categories duplicate the functionality offered by the '/' subpage notation. The same thing could have been achieved by structuring the book thus:

* [[Cookbook]]
** [[Cookbook/Recipes]]
*** [[Cookbook/Recipes/Fish]] - notice here, the scope allows us to drop the word 'recipes' from the end.
*** [[Cookbook/Recipes/Meat]]
*** [[Cookbook/Recipes/Vegan]]
** [[Cookbook/Kitchen equipment]]

I guess it's arguable which is better. You could even write your entire book in the Category namespace I guess, just to exploit its subcategory abilities.

This section has been disputed in the [[User talk:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks|talk page]].

=== Image use policy ===

* [[Wikibooks:Image use policy]]

=== Administration policy ===

* [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]
* [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]]

=== Page protection policy ===

In a perfect world, no pages should need to be protected, in fact, this open attitude should be strongly enouraged. Many users can be trusted to improve the formatting of the page, without changing its content, and update links which become out-of-date. In the world we live in, however, it seems apparent that some pages need to be protected. I think the real problem is not the opportunist vandals, since it probably takes them more time to vandalise a page, than it does for another user to revert it. The real problem occurs when these vandalism attempts are scripted.

So far it seems this is limited to automated linkspamming software that attempts to get higher page rankings for its pages, most likely on the Google search engine. If this is the case, then merely protected high-profile pages such as those displayed for the URLs wikibooks.org, www.wikibooks.org and en.wikibooks.org, should suffice. The first two link to [[Wikibooks portal]] (which is currently not protected, and has been targeted by linkspammers in the past), the second links to [[Main page]] which is heavily protected and monitored.

This kind of scripting could evolve into much more sophisticated vandalism attacks, which could be incredibly annyoing for the average user to revert, and would most likely require a complete database rollback. These sorts of attacks could be detected and prevented, but the current system in place may not be sufficient forever. The future solution would most likely involve the apache server keeping an eye out for many edits in a very short space of time, all coming from a single IP address. Having said that, some of these scripts are quite cunning. I've seen what I refer to as 'distributed linkspamming attacks' which come quite slowly from multiple IP addresses, to make them look like legitimate edits.

In the meantime, the current system of blocking IP addresses will have to suffice. It might be worth formalising a procedure for checking the recent edits for obvious vandalism. See [[#Edit review policy|Edit review policy]]

=== Edit review policy ===

Some sort of simple procedure for those who can be bothered to review edits for vandalism, linkspam, new pages not conforming to naming policy, uploading illegal images, etc.

e.g.: If you can't be bothered to check all edits made, perhaps just checking those made by non-registered users (vandalism attacks will most likely be from these).

The recipe index is kind of insane. It's a big page, and just getting bigger. Worse, it is unmaintainable. How can one tell if a recipe is missing? By looking, recipe by recipe, in that huge page. Probably a category would be better, but note that recipes really should appear under multiple names. I believe the term for this is a &quot;permuted index&quot;. So a &quot;Spicy Chicken&quot; recipe would also appear as &quot;Chicken, Spicy&quot;, etc. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:24, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

:: Agreed, I was thinking about this but for slightly different reasons. Seems like uber-categorization is the &quot;answer&quot; though it's more difficult for newbies to maintain. So, for instance, we could have categories like so:
::*Category:Cookbook:Ingredient
::*Category:Cookbook:Technique
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Poultry
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Vegan
:: The cookbook seems like an ideal candidate for fairly strict categorization like this. Notice that I put the &quot;Cookbook&quot; namespace into the category -- I think this makes more sense if other wikibooks want to use the same categories (Category:Recipe, for example might be used in a technical setting like a HOWTO). 
:: Of course, this requires tagging every recipe with the recipe category, but that seems like what we need to do to get an automatic index. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 02:14, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I think we really should have an giant global index for people to browse. I just don't think we should be trying to maintain one by hand. I want to see automatic generation of:
:::*Toasted Cheese Sandwich
:::*Cheese Sandwich, Toasted
:::*Sandwich, Toasted Cheese
:::*Vegetable Stew and Dumplings
:::*Stew and Dumplings, Vegetable
:::*Dumplings, Vegetable Stew and
:::*Mussels with Potatoes
:::*Potatoes, Mussels with
:::[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 03:45, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

::::Agreed that we shouldn't try to maintain one by hand. Automatic permutation of titles like that would be helpful, but there would be some odd cases:
::::*Grandma's Pumpkin Pie
::::*Pumpkin Pie, Grandma's
::::*Pie, Grandma's Pumpkin
:::::Odd? No, that's perfect. It's what you need if you half-way remember the name of a recipe. It's also good if you just want to browse through all the pumpkin pie or pumpkin recipes, eliminating the need for lots of obscure categories like &quot;pumpkin pie&quot;. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:44, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
::::We are facing two problems:
::::# Finding recipes by major ingredient (e.g. Chicken or Pumpkin)
::::# Easily distinguishing content within a namespace (Recipes from Cooking Techniques, or Stews from Breads)
::::For (1), a custom tag which created an index based on the tagged &quot;major&quot; ingredients would be good (so we could have a Chicken section); for (2) I think the existing category tags are enough, we just have to be more strict and thorough with them, which means a set policy to which new users can be pointed.
::::[[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:10, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:::::The category problem is different. Indexing needs to be done automatically. For categories, we could use automatic suggestions. Imagine if it worked like autocompletion in a web browser URL entry area or in an email client &quot;To:&quot; area. Google has a [[w:List_of_Google_services_and_tools#Google_Suggest|beta of this]] for their site, letting you choose from common queries. See [[w:List_of_Google_services_and_tools#Google_Suggest|here (Wikipedia article)]], [[w:Image:Google_Suggest_%28Beta%29_blacklist_demo_animation_1.gif|here (animated gif demo)]], and of course [http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en here (Google's beta)]. Tree-structured browsing, as is done on [http://freshmeat.net/ freshmeat.net] for project categorization, could be somewhat helpful as well. Note that this all pretty much means that the categories need to be edited separately from the wiki text. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:44, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

::: As a test, I created a couple of fake recipes:
:::*[[Cookbook:Kellen:Fake Recipe 1|Kellen:Fake Recipe 1]]
:::*[[Cookbook:Kellen:Fake Recipe 2|Kellen:Fake Recipe 2]]
:::Each of these is tagged with a namespace-enabled category, e.g. Category:Cookbook:Recipe
:::Unfortunately the automatic links to these categories don't work correctly, but if one goes to the page directly: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Cookbook:Recipe Cookbook:Recipe Category page] it seems to work. I'm not sure about how easy it is for us to ask for/get modifications to the wiki software to fix this, or to customize it to properly alphabetize things with respect to namespaces (i.e. not file everything under &quot;Cookbook&quot;), but seems to me that this could work. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:50, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

==categorization proposal==
After looking at this a bit more, I think that categorizing all of our cookbook pages will be essential to indexing and browsing. I'd propose using a (fake-)namespace-enabled system, like so:
*Category:Cookbook
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Breakfast
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Bread
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Diet:Gluten_Free
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Diet:Kosher
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Cuisine:African
*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Cuisine:Caribbean
*Category:Cookbook:Cooking_Technique
*Category:Cookbook:Equipment
*Category:Cookbook:Ingredient
This requires that:
#All existing pages in the cookbook be tagged with the approprite category (e.g. all recipes should minimally be in Category:Cookbook:Recipe)
#To be useful, all these category tags must be aliased properly 
(2) means to have the correctly set the sort-order name; for &quot;Chicken Salad&quot;, the link would be &quot;Category:Cookbook:Recipe|Chicken Salad&quot;

I realize that this is a very labor intensive process, but I believe it'll help readers immensely. The initial conversion of adding Category:Cookbook:Recipe to all pages linked from Cookbook:Recipes could be done with a bot.

[[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 20:19, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

:We're seeing some rather serious problems with caching, and with the use of &quot;:&quot; in a category name. Until somebody fixes all the bugs, we should stay away from anything likely to trigger problems. Also, namespace problems have not been a problem with categories. It's better to keep things short and simple if we can. Before we start using lots of categories, we should have some sort of an autocompletion and suggestion mechanism in place. Otherwise, there's no way people will get something like Gluten_Free right on all the recipes. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:28, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

::I see the caching problem, what's the problem with &quot;:&quot; in a category name?
::I don't think I was clear on my reasoning: I wanted to categorize things like this because it would allow us to have an automatically generated index listing for each item. For example, my [[Cookbook:Cardamom_Bread]] recipe could be tagged with:
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Cuisine:Scandanavian
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Bread
::*Category:Cookbook:Recipe:Vegan
::And if a user browses to the main Category:Cookbook:Recipe, they'll see it linked in the main listing. If they browse to the &quot;Vegan&quot; or &quot;Bread&quot; subcategory, they'll see it listed there, and if they browse to &quot;Cusine&quot; then to &quot;Scandanavian&quot;, they'll see it listed there.
::The main advantage of this is that it centralizes the categorization of a recipe. Right now, we add a recipe, then add it to up to the bread page, to the recipes page, to the vegan_cusine page, etc. Using categories, we can just edit the page for the recipe and add it to all these places at once.
::I share your reservations about the software, but I tend to think that we'll eventually have to do this sort of categorization anyway.
::[[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 20:58, 22 May 2005 (UTC)
:::Would anyone be opposed if I tagged all of the recipes from [[Cookbook:Recipes]] with the category Category:Cookbook:Recipe? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:11, 25 May 2005 (UTC)
::::I do, for several reasons. First, no other category is named like that. Conflicts have not been a problem. Second, that's a ''lot'' of edits. You'd better get near-unanimous agreement that this is right before proceeding. Third of all, will this get us a friendly index? It won't be permutated. Fourth, over on the Commons, people have been saying nasty things about the performance of categories and the effects they have on the wiki servers. Perhaps using a template might be wise. Sorry to be so down about the idea, but I'd rather we all think this through carefully before editing like mad. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 11:36, 25 May 2005 (UTC)
:::::Ok.
:::::I do think that a relatively friendly index will be created; true it won't be permuted, but it'll be something easier to maintain than the [[Cookbook:Recipes]] page.
:::::Would you be equally opposed if I suggested just tagging recipes with Category:Recipe?
:::::There are already a fair number of categorized pages (I think by [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]) under [[:Category:Recipes]].
:::::Can I get a link to the commons discussion? Seems like some of these things could/should be easily solved. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 19:07, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

::::::It seems that [[:Category:Recipes]] is meant to hold sub-categories, not recipes. You should either choose a different name, like [[:Category:Recipe]] (no '''s''') or [[:Category:Index]], or move the sub-categories out. Other than that I guess it is kind of a nice idea. I'd like to see a few other people (maybe Redlentil and Gentgeen) show enthusiastic support before you start though. The nice thing about the current setup is that the boilerplate overhead is small enough that I can easily type it all in from memory. Maybe you should do this as a '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' template at the top, in place of the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Cookbook]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;''' wikitext we put there now.

:::::::Kellen, thanks for inviting my comments but I'm pretty clueless about categories. I'm never entirely convinced of their value. As I understand Albert's view, excessive use of categories can cause server problems, particularly when they include colons. Is that right? If so, I think detailed categories as you earlier suggested, although very useful are impractical.  Using a thick category like Category:Recipe is OK, but I can't see it would make anything any easier. This may be just my ignorance. As for templates, my cluelessness there is almost entirely complete. Sorry. [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 17:32, 29 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Work-around for non-updating category listings ==

You erase completly the category from the article and you save the page... then you link again the category with the new asigned word after the '''|''' sign.

Solution from mediawiki bugzilla:

I have just noticed that someone on en.wikipedia started to remove categories
from articles with one edit only to revert the change with the next edit. That
seems to be the current work-around for this bug. Needless to say, I agree that
fixing it is a rather high priority.

A bug has been filed [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2166 here]

::Yes, I noticed that and did that on a couple of my categories and test pages. Thanks for encoding it here though! [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:15, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

== cool feature examples ==

Recipe scaling exists. You type in how many servings you want, and the recipe is scaled.
Unless the info is in a cookie, [http://www.recipezaar.com/114266 this] and [http://beef.allrecipes.com/az/PnFridFiltswithMshrmSc.asp this] should be fine
examples of how it works. Just change the number of servings.

Also, look at this [http://beef.allrecipes.com/directory/2233.asp category] page. It shows ratings and has links to reviews. Anybody can post a review. I don't think people have to understand wikitext markup. :-/

Better than simple ratings would be ones like those used by a music recommendation service, where a recipe is ranked by how it pleases people who rate recipes similarly to yourself. (and by how it displeases people opposite to yourself) The same software feature used to ensure a heavy-metal fan doesn't get suggested country and western should work to make sure that I never get suggested to eat habaneros on tofu. (and I know, some of you are thinking &quot;Yum!&quot;)

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 12:03, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

::Neat! The scaling is nice (and relatively easy). What I like is the conversions between US and metric -- they must have some DB of the weight per tablespoon/cup/whatever of various ingredients. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 19:14, 25 May 2005 (UTC)

== move featured recipe template ==
I'd like to move &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;{{featured recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipe}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; for a main navigational template (Cookbook, Recipe Index) and category inclusion (into Category:Recipe).

:Good idea. There's an &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ingredient}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; one too, probably deserving the same treatment.

We could also (as you noted) use a piped variable &lt;nowiki&gt;{{1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to our template, but we'd have to update that when the name of a page changed.

A while back I added a bunch of info about vegan ingredient substitutes, with specifics of brand names and links to their respective webpages [[User:The_bellman]] did some amount of purging of these with a NPOV complaint. I responded both on [[User_talk:The_bellman|his user talk page]] and the [[Talk:Cookbook:Vegan_cuisine]] page, with no replies on either. I am going to reinstate these links for the reasons I have written in both places. If somebody can think of a better format, I am open to suggestions, but I think the info itself is useful. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 02:50, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I have no problems with product recomendations.  Our NPOV policy is much looser than our big sister's, and specifying specific brand name products is common for a cookbook. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 21:08, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Classic Recipes ==

I think that certain 'classic' classes of recipes should be dealt with differently. Take, for instance, [[Cookbook:Lasagna|Lasagna]]. Right now there is a - no doubt lovely - specific lasagna recipe. The problem is that these recipes are added on a sort of first come, first serve basis. There are a thousand different lasagna-recipes that could just as well take this place. I think it should be general practice to move these to a more specific name like &quot;Ricotta Lasagna&quot; and use the &quot;Lasagna&quot; page for a lasagna recipe that is as generic as possible, with not so much a recipe as a general description and notes and tips that apply to all lasagna's.

I think this would provide a way to transition smoothly between 'information pages' and recipes. For instance, the &quot;Pasta&quot; page gives information on pasta, with tips and notes, the &quot;Lasagna&quot; page does the same, but with more of a recipe structure on how lasagna's are basically made and some tips on ingredient combinations and finally the &quot;Eggplant Lasagna&quot; gives a specific lasgna recipe.
For an example of what I mean, check the [[Cookbook:Risotto|Risotto]] page.

I may be stating the blindingly obvious here, in which case I apologise. :)  [[User:Risk|risk]] 17:18, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:: You are correct. In wikipedia these are generally turned into disambiguation pages. In our case, of course, we're disambiguating between some relatively similar things, but I think that's OK. I say if you find something like this, move the old recipes and link them from your new disambiguation page. Also consider creating a &quot;____ recipes&quot; category for it if there's enough need, e.g. &quot;Category:Lasagna recipes&quot; [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 06:33, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

Hello, I'm an administrator on both the [[w:User:Jaxl|English Wikipedia]] and the [[q:User:Jaxl|English Wikiquote]].

== Once more, from the top ==

'''Note''': This section copied from one of my posts on [[Talk:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]], which, I guess, is where all this started. Note that some of my conclusions were subsequently altered. I shall merge in the more pertinent parts when I have time. Please don't add replies to this section. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 18:34, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

Okay. I think we both have different interpretations of what Wikibooks actually is, and the most effective means of using it. I guess it was rather a dumb idea of mine to choose some standards without adequately justifying those choices. This almost always fails to produce standards which get adhered to, in any system where people are not rewarded for following said standards. e.g. In a company, you get paid money to follow their rules. On a wiki there is no obvious financial reward at all. But I hope you at least agree that standards are important on collaborative projects, if only to the extent that we interpret language in the same way. i.e. We share a common 'dictionary'.

For what it's worth, I'm a 28-year-old software developer, and during some of the projects I've had to 'endure', I came across various pitfalls of the processes commonly used within those projects. Most of these don't really pertain to wiki, but some do. I also fairly new to the wiki community, but I really like the idea, because it does to information what web-forums and newsgroups can only dream of.


=== The dangers of page naming ===

I've finally read through all the material I can find about page name delimiters, and I'll just summarise what I've found here:

N.B. I use the character '*' to represent any amount of whitespace, including no whitespace. Valid whitespace characters seem to be: '_' and '%20', but not ' ', since this is an illegal character in a URL. All browsers convert it to '%20'.

'''page name -&gt; wiki interpretation'''

&quot;*GTASA*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA&quot;

&quot;*Talk*:*GTASA*&quot; -&gt; a page in the &quot;Talk&quot; namespace named &quot;GTASA&quot;

&quot;*GTASA:Ryder*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA:Ryder&quot;

&quot;*GTASA:_Ryder*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA:_Ryder&quot;

&quot;*GTASA/Ryder*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA/Ryder&quot;. Provides a link to &quot;GTASA&quot;

&quot;*GTASA/_Ryder*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA/_Ryder&quot;. Provides a link to &quot;GTASA&quot;

&quot;*GTASA_/_Ryder*&quot; -&gt; a page in the global namespace named &quot;GTASA_/_Ryder&quot;. Provides a link to &quot;GTASA&quot;

Notice the last three are conceptually identical, but will return three different pages. Not really what we want.


=== The dangers of hierarchies ===

Hierarchies are probably most familiar in things like URLs. The idea is to use them when something is conceptually a 'child' element of another element. This is great for some applications, but the problem is that with a bunch of disparate concepts, as you might find in a guide for GTA:SA, it's nigh impossible to get everyone to agree which means of arranging things in a hierarchy is best.

e.g. I noticed above that the page 'Vehicle Missions' is a child of the 'Vehicles' page, whereas since it's ultimately talking about missions, and not vehicles, I might have decided to make it a child of the 'Missions' page.

The same is true for most classification schemes. Let's take an example for movies. If I decide on some categories like 'Action', 'Drama', 'Comedy', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi', etc.

The problem now is that when I want to add a movie to one of these categories, which one should I choose? The movie 'Pulp Fiction' surely belongs to more than one of these categories.

The error here is defining categories which are not mutually-exclusive. A good example of categories might be 'A', 'B', 'C', etc., in which case, there could be little argument that the movie 'Pulp Fiction' should belong in the 'P' category.

Categories also fail where the category names are poorly defined, as they are right now.

Furthermore the hierarchy might change as new content is added, and if this hierarchy is included in the page name, then the page name will have to change also. From my experience, it's a lot easier to change the content of a page, than it is to change the page's name.

Another problem with using the '/' notation is the implication that the parent node MUST exist. I might want to have a page &quot;foo/bar&quot;, but not a page &quot;foo&quot;.


=== Conclusions ===

To avoid confusion, I shall define the following terms:

;bookshelf:Conceptially, an index of one of more categories of '''books''' on Wikibooks.
;book:This is perhaps analagous to a paper book. This '''book''' may belong to any number of '''bookshelves'''.
;page:This is perhaps analagous to a chapter in a paper book. Note that one of the design goals of Wikibooks was to allow many '''books''' to share the same '''pages'''. e.g. Most of the Wikibooks relating to computer programming, tend to include the global '''page''' containing the ASCII chart.
;page name:The suffix of the URL used to retrieve a '''page'''. i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''page name'''. Note that many similar suffices may be used to reference the same '''page''', so I shall define it to mean the shortest suffix required to retrieve the '''page'''.
;content page:Conceptually, perhaps, a leaf-node '''page''' which contains mostly useful content pertaining to its '''page name'''.
;index page:A '''page''' whose primary reason for existence is to provide an index to other '''pages'''. The index could be hierarchical, alphabetical, or whatever. A '''bookshelf''' page is an example of such a page.

* Use '''page names''' solely to uniquely identify discrete concepts within the scope of the '''book'''. They should not be used to denote hierarchy.
* Keep the '''page names''' as short as possible, while making every effort to avoid namespace collision, by using scoping or disambiguation where necessary.
* To provide a hierarchical model of all the '''content pages''' relevant to the '''book''', use an '''index page''' to index the existing content. This is the current purpose of the 'Contents' page. If the conceptual hierarchy should need to change, you only need to modify that one '''page'''. This also allows you to apply multiple conceptual models to the same information, simply by having multiple '''index pages.''' e.g. the 'Index' page will ultimately provide an alphabetical index of the same '''content pages''', and the FAQ page is starting to link back into the main content.
* To provide a hierarchical model of all the '''content pages''' relevant to a smaller scope (e.g. all missions in Los Santos), use another '''index page'''.
* Try to avoid changing the '''page names''' of existing '''pages''', or creating too many new '''content pages''' until there is a clear page naming standard.

Perhaps it would be clearer if I specified how I ultimately expect the pages to be named. The string &quot;GTASA&quot; should be interpreted as &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;:-

* Index pages
** &quot;GTASA&quot; - Main page, linking only to other index pages.
** &quot;GTASA: Contents&quot; - Full hierarchical contents, linking to every content page.
** &quot;GTASA: Index&quot; - Full alphabetical index, linking to every content page.
** &quot;GTASA: Frequently Asked Questions &quot; - This page is a little hairy, since it contains both indices and content, but I shall put it in here in the hope that ultimately it will only contain links to other pages.
** &quot;
* Content pages
** &quot;GTASA: Mission: Ryder&quot; - Anything pertaining to the 'Ryder' mission.
** &quot;GTASA: Mission: End of the Line&quot; - Anything pertaining to the 'End of the Line' mission.
** &quot;GTASA: Character: Ryder&quot; - Anything pertaining the the character 'Ryder'
** &quot;GTASA: Vehicle: Infernus&quot; - Anything pertaining the the vehicle 'Infernus'
** &quot;GTASA: Item: Night-vision Goggles&quot; - Anything pertaining the the item 'Night-vision Goggles'

If you think having only a single index to all missions is too much of a 'spoiler', then you could create another index page, say, just for Los Santos missions, which would link to the 'Ryder' mission, but not to the 'End of the Line' mission.

The means used to disambiguate the page names is arbitrary. I merely chose the colon (as used typographically rather than in a scoping context. i.e. &quot;foo: bar&quot; rather than &quot;foo:bar&quot;), because this seemed to be the way that the content was already organised. Some other examples:

* &quot;GTASA: Ryder (mission)&quot;
* &quot;GTASA: Mission - Ryder&quot;

I really don't care which method is used, providing it's agreed upon. Maybe the colon is a bad idea because it implies a namespace where none exists.

Okay. It's 8:00pm here, and I'm off to the pub for a while.

[[User:Aya|Aya]] 18:56, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:I wasn't aware that there was a misunderstanding at all, but now I finally see what you're getting at! Yes I did think of the hierarchy of the Vehicle Missions--''after'' I'd moved it! Certainly it should go under missions.
:But what other examples are there of multiple-location pages like the Pulp Fiction example you gave? From a quick look at the list, pretty much everything might as well stay right where it is until such time as good names are found for &quot;collectible hidden things&quot; and such. For neatness' sake the Burglary guide should go under the Vehicle Missions page, but, again, that's minor.
:As for implying the parent exists, in the currently applicable situations I can't think of a parent directory that would be unwanted, except for /Cheats/ but I've got plans for content there too.
:The colons as they look nice and make nicer-looking page auto-titles than the slashes do, but they still imply an upper directory exists. Brackets make users less inclined to think there is a higher level, but as a downside they generate ugly URLs (&quot;Grand_Theft_Auto:_San_Andreas_%28Contents%29&quot;).
:I'm interested in using slashes because that is the standard for nested pages both in many of the other books here and the pages on other Wikis. Also, and more importantly, the MediaWiki engine will eventually support a TOC link on each page that will generate a list of its child pages, but this will not however support colon-based directories. Therefore for future-proofing and overall cohesiveness with the style adopted by the rest of the Wikibooks projects it seems the slash should be the way to go. Hmmm...
:But hang on, I've got an idea, I'll just post this and do that :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Master Thief Garrett]] 14:22, 17 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Category hierarchies ==

From the main page: ''The problem is, categories duplicate the functionality offered by the '/' subpage notation.''

This is incorrect. In the cookbook, the recipes fit into many different categories, e.g. a recipe in [[:Category:Vegan recipes]] and in [[:Category:Bread]] (see: [[Cookbook:Cardamom Bread]]). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:48, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

: You're correct of course. We really need a good policy on use of categories. They're just too flexible for their own good. Maybe it's no big deal, and &quot;Use categories at your own discretion&quot; is about all we can say. I guess they can always be moved or renamed later on if there's a conflict. It was so much easier on Wikipedia, since there could be fewer arguments about the correct use of categories. It's almost as if each book on Wikibooks would benefit from having its own namespace, with its own pages, categories, images, and templates in that namespace. Another way of saying it is, perhaps with the current software implementation, each Wikibook needs its own wiki, in the same way that Wiktionary and Wikipedia are effectively separate books in their own right, but both theoretically could have been separate Wikibooks projects on this site. I suspect there would be many advantages from having all WikiMedia projects sharing the same wiki, providing the MediaWiki software could keep them all separate. Intra-wiki-linking feels much more professional than inter-wiki-linking. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 14:36, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

Where hierarchical categories come into play is where there are managment issues in the categories. In the main wikipedia this is not so much a problem since everything belongs to the same &quot;book.&quot; In the cookbook we have lots of stray categories with only one or two things, many of which are not subcategories of the &quot;main&quot; cookbook categories. If we make sure that we prefix everything category for the cookbook with &quot;Cookbook:&quot;, this mangment becomes much easier. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:48, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

: I can't see a conceptual difference between making those categories subcategories of the 'main cookbook' categories, and altering their names to make it look like they are subcategories (regardless of whether you subsequently add them to be bona fide subcategories too.) Having said that, and based on my previous reply, it might be worth prepending them anyway, to serve as a scoping tool to prevent namespace collision, rather than implying a hierarchy. Perhaps the following might be useful:

:: For a book entitled &quot;foo&quot;, the following page prefixes are reserved for that book:

 (Main:)Foo[/*]
 (Main:)Foo[:*]
 Talk:Foo[/*]
 Talk:Foo[:*]
 Image:Foo[/*]
 Image talk:Foo[/*]
 Template:Foo[/*]
 Template talk:Foo[/*]
 Category:Foo[/*]
 Category talk:Foo[/*]

:: Only use pages outside these prefixes where they are conceptually designed to be shared between multiple Wikibooks. It may also be worth listing these generic pages on another page, so people are aware of them, and don't accidentally create a fork.
::: This is part of [[WB:NC]] (although images, templates, and categories are in recommended use only), although it is not strictly enforced because little effort has gone in by users to enforce them. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:26, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
:::: Wow. I accidentally came up with the existing policy without having read it. &quot;Great minds think alike&quot; or just &quot;blindlingly obvious&quot;? Yeah. It's obviously not a followed convention for those who have never read it. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:25, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: In a way this seems like common sense, but it's not written down anywhere. Note that I only allow the ':' syntax for pages in main and talk namespaces, since it's the only one which provides different wiki behavior. I still believe the '/' is typographically preferable. I already used this convention with the page header template [[Template:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas/Header]] for the book [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 14:36, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

My inclination is that categories probably shouldn't be shared across wikibooks anyway, though maybe entire wikibooks could be categorized together (Category:Physics books). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:48, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

: Again, you're probably correct. I guess there has to be a distinction between the categorization of books, and the categorization of pages within a single book. &lt;s&gt;Back to your original question, I'd go ahead and create categories of the form 'Category:Cookbook/Meat recipes', etc. I guess it's probably worth including them all as subcategories of 'Category:Cookbook'. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 14:36, 13 July 2005 (UTC)&lt;/s&gt; Check out [[#The movies example|The movies example]] to see if we are even talking about the same thing. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:35, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

It's running MediaWiki 1.5, indeed was running it long before any other project. So that's basically one BIG sandbox to make use of.

There, one problem solved already! :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:54, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

: Cool. If that site can be guaranteed to remain up 24/7, that's exactly what we need. If we can get the DNS name sandbox.wikimedia.org to point to the same IP address, and co-ordinate with the developers to ensure that this site always contains the latest bleeding-edge release of MediaWiki, we can get some free beta-testers, while minimizing site damage. We also need to make sure all WikiMedia sites include this link. This could prove more difficult, since there are hundreds of them. I'm beginning to think [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]] was right, and that I should move all this stuff to meta.wikimedia.org. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 14:37, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

== The movies example ==

See: [[#The dangers of hierarchies|The dangers of hierarchies]]

Talk moved from that section:

In your example here for movies, my current view of things would be to make the movie pages distinct from any hierarchical page naming except for the top-level namespace (e.g. Movies:The Blob), then have your structural book pages as necessary (e.g. Movies/Horror and Movies/Sci-Fi), have appropriate categories (e.g. Category:Movies:Horror and Category:Movies:Sci-Fi), include Movies:The_Blob in both these categories and link to the category listings from the structural pages. This is not without its problems -- say if you wanted extended descriptions of the movies on the listings page, or you wanted to have more defined categories.

: I agree with &quot;Movies:The Blob&quot;, but I might prefer &quot;Movies/The Blob&quot; to get the auto-link. The use of categories is obviously correct for this example, although I would've chosen the names &quot;Category:Horror movies&quot; and &quot;Category:Sci-Fi movies&quot;, and added them both to the category &quot;Category:Movies&quot;. But I don't understand why you need the pages &quot;Movies/Horror&quot; and &quot;Movies/Sci-Fi&quot;.  - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:07, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

::In the current paradigm you'd want &quot;Movies/Horror&quot; or &quot;Movies/Sci-Fi&quot; as detailed descriptions of the genre, but you'd have &quot;Category:Horror movies&quot; to actually catalog all of the horror movies. In reality, you could put your detailed description on the catagory page, but that doesn't seem to be current practice. I'm actually inclined in some instances in the cookbook to make the category pages more like these &quot;normal&quot; pages, especially where on the pages there are listings of recipes [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine]] for an example. If the &quot;Vegan cuisine&quot; page was actually a category page, you'd automagically get the listing of recipes and subcategories below. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 00:50, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:::I'd be inclined to agree with your idea of adding more detail to the category pages, rather than creating new pages for the detail. I'm sure this was how they were intended to be used, since otherwise, I wouldn't see the point of the software forcing you to create the category page solely to list the entries in that category. It subsequently occurred to me that if category pages can be used in this way, and also have the benefits of subsetting, why would you ever need a regular (non-category) page? A regular page strikes me as being a category page that you can't add subcategories to. I also wonder as to the reasoning behind having a separate template namespace, although it may be purely for performance reasons (i.e. changing a template page forces the software to flush its cache for all pages which include that template). - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

::::&quot;changing a template page forces the software to flush its cache for all pages which include that template&quot; is '''not''' true in the case of categories. You must do a [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing#Dummy_edit null edit] on each page which includes the template in order to flush the cache. See the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Template#A_category_tag_in_a_template.3B_caching_problem meta help page] for more info. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 08:57, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

You may want a movie to be in Category:Movies:1980s and Category:Movies:Horror, but as far as I know, there's no category intersection pages... /ramble [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 18:02, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

: This may be the point of confusion between us, since as far as I was aware, there is such a feature, and its unique to categories. As well as adding a category tag to a regular page, you can also add the tag to a category page. In this case, the category for the page you added the tag to, is considered to be a sub-category of the category name specified in the tag. When you subsequently click on the super-category, it will list not only the pages in the category, but also all it's subcategories. If you were unaware of this, it was the reason I gave for why category names should not imply hierarchy. See [[:Category:Science]] for an example. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 19:07, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

:: I mean something different. 
::First, some other observations: When you make a category a subcategory of another category (yeesh), you're essentially including all the pages in that category in the supercategory. The pages in the subcategory '''do not''' show up in the pages listing in the supercategory. It is implied that they would also belong there, but there's no way to view all of them at once (so far as I know). This is problematic for, say, recipes, where you might sometimes '''not''' care about the category structure, and you just want to see all the recipes that fall under [[:Category:South American recipes]], for example. The interim solution for us is to add everything to [[:Category:Recipes]] to create a big index. This is getting unweildy though, so I think I might move them all into [[:Category:Recipe]] and leave the subcategories under [[:Category:Recipes]].
::What I was specifically referring to above is that if I have two distinct categories which have pages in common, there is no way to filter my view so that I see only the recipes that belong to both. This comes into play in the cookbook where we have [[:Category:Soups]] and [[:Category:Vegan recipes]]. There is currently a [[:Category:Vegan soups]], but this seems wrong to me. The correct way would be to file the recipe under both &quot;Soups&quot; and &quot;Vegan recipes&quot; and then get a view which is limited to things in both of these categories instead of replicating all of the possible food types (Soups, Desserts, Mains, Peruvian recipes, etc) with &quot;Vegan&quot; prefixed to them. I realize that &quot;Vegan soups&quot; can be categorized under both &quot;Vegan recipes&quot; and &quot;Soups&quot; but that still strikes me as redundant work. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 01:03, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

:::Ahh. I see. Perhaps substituting the word 'category' for the word 'set' might make things clearer (i.e. formal set theory). Thus you can have a set of soups and a set of vegan recipes, but there no way to automatically generate an intersection of the two sets (i.e. the set of all vegan soups). In addition, you can have a set of meat recipes and a set of fish recipes, but you can't generate a union of the two sets (i.e. the set of all meat or fish recipes, probably equivalent to the set of all non-vegitarian recipes). Furthermore, the elements of a subset are not shown in a superset, which might be considered more 'correct' in set theory.

:::This would no doubt require a software change, and a new syntax for creating unions/intersections, and perhaps an option to show entries in all subcategories. Sounds like a neat idea, and might be worth suggesting to the dev team, although I suspect you probably know better than I how to do this. I'm beginning to think I'd be better off joining the dev team, and fixing things in there, rather than creating extensive documents to workaround these issues.

:::Regardless, I still don't think that implying hierarchy in categories by their name is a good idea, since it conceptually duplicates the behavior of subcategories. The original Pokemon example is perhaps a special case, since it deals with a fictional universe. I see that more as 'scoping' to prevent namespace collisions, rather than 'hierarchy', although they can be argued to be conceptually equivalent. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:46, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

::::Agreed in most instances. The main thing I am concerned about is whether the categories should be scoped to the book or not. I tend to think that they should, but that the books should be categorized (mentioned this before). A potential problem with this approach is that at some point someone may wish to categorize related chapters in different books, but I think this is a rather minimal downside for having a clean category space. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 08:57, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

== Be bold ==

Having said what you said in your critique, why don't you be bold and try to fix some of these problems that are plaguing Wikibooks? [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:36, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: The point of writing the document was to mostly to serve as justification for any subsequent changes I make, so that when my actions get questioned (as they no doubt will), I don't have to tediously explain the same point to several different users, but rather give a link to the document. Futher, as I stated in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]], I was going to make some changes, but it would be fair to consult other Wikibookians before doing so, which I'm hoping this talk page will become. It just seemed logical to keep a record of my train of thought, to make it easier for other users to identify any flaws in my reasoning.

: The fundamental problem I have identified is that the current policy documents are numerous, invisible, vague and self-contradictory. That is why people keep discussing their meaning so much. In order to solve the problems, I figured the best procedure would be:

# Identify the problems with policy
# Identify the causes of the problems
# Solve the problems, by eliminating the cause where possible
# Devise new policy to implement the solutions in a practical fashion
# Make sure people agree with the new policy, to prevent my edits getting reverted
# Update the policy documents to prevent future misunderstanding
# Make sure the policy is more visible to new users, especially those creating new books
# Retroactively apply new policy to existing books

: There seems little point in performing the final step as long as the policy is unclear. New books are being created all the time, and I just don't have time to fix them all. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:10, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

:: So far, the only policies actively enforced are [[WB:WIN]] (the constitution if you will), [[WB:FP]], and [[WB:AT]], although there is an increasing amount of [[WB:NC]] enformcement.  Other policies are pretty much common to all MW wikis (deletion, editing, etc). [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 06:39, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

::: Aha. I think I've found one of the sources of confusion. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_Wikibooks_is_not&amp;diff=129510&amp;oldid=129062 this diff], made by yourself. You completely changed the meaning of the document, by changing the more specific term &quot;primary research&quot; (adequately defined), with the incredibly vague term &quot;original research&quot;. Its new definition arguably covers every existing book on the site. This needs to be fixed. WB:FP is common sense, especially for software-engineering people link myself, but needs to remain, and ought to tightened up (especially forking from Wikipedia). WB:AT should probably be merged into WB:WIN. WB:NC is a bit more fuzzy at the moment, especially as it starts with a link to WB:HNS. WB:WIN is a bad idea for a 'constitution' anyway. It's much more effective to define what something is, rather than define what it is not. I'm thinking of something more akin to [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#The goal of Wikibooks]] - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 08:16, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

:::: Perhaps the diff you have shown introduces ambiguity, but the current version of [[WB:WIN]] does not have it (thanks for [[User:Dovi]] who pointed it out in the talk page).  It should still reflect the spirit of what it is meant.

:::: Most of the policies are fuzzy because they are not well fleshed out (or in dire need of enforcement).  Historically, I believe [[WB:AT]] is separate due to this being an agreed-upon policy between Wikibooks and Wikisource.  I will be the first to admit that perhaps [[WB:WIN]] is a &quot;bad idea&quot;, but we need a series of pages that will define what Wikibooks is (of course, I will ask you to contribute in a big manner, seeing you have your ideas and seem to be willing to implement them).
::::* [[Wikibooks:Books]] for what consitutes book material.
::::* [[Wikibooks:Instructional material]] for what constitutes instructional material.  The two together will define what is a proper Wikibook.
::::* [[Wikibooks:Bookshelf]] and [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Librarian]] (&quot;the first Wikibooks WikiProject&quot;) for how Wikibooks defines a bookshelf and how users can contribute to stocking these shelves with new books as they are created.

:::: Of course, with radical changes to Wikibooks as we know it, we may have to relent on existing policies and introduce.  I admit that I can be considered &quot;old guard&quot; as these changes may change the mission of Wikibooks, but if the public likes the wiki to go that way, they may force our hand.  Among these we would need:
::::* [[Wikibooks:Reference material]] for what constitutes general nonfiction books (as opposed to, say, Wikipedia articles or books of a nonfictional material).  This would form the third part of defining what appropriate Wikibooks should be.

:::: [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:20, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

::::: Pah. Now we have the same conversation going on two pages. I've just replied to your post to the mailing list on [[User talk:KelvSYC|your talk page]]. Let's shift it to there for the moment. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:57, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

We could sure use someone to enforce [[WB:NC]] to [[General Chemistry]] or determine through [[WB:FP]] what parts of [[Programming:C plus plus]] and [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] to keep in a merged book (both long debacles that has existed since well before I was a user, let alone an admin). [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:36, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: I was aware of these problems, and they do need to be addressed, but the problem will only get worse as new users create more pages making the same errors. I already made to effort to apply the new naming conventions to the [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] guide, as well as all the other tidying up required to cope with the changes, and it can take a long time. Feel free to 'be bold' yourself if you want these other books changed more speedily, but I would probably first devise a scripting system for a bot to make these changes. Probably only needs 50 lines of perl (not that I recommend perl, but it is well known). - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:10, 14 July 2005 (UTC)
:: Pratically all MW bots use [[Programming:Python|Python]] by the way. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 06:39, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
::: Yeah. I had seen the Sourceforge project. I much prefer Python to perl. I have personally submitted source code corrections to it before. Since it's the most common, I tend to use the word &quot;perl&quot; to mean &quot;any scripting language comparable to perl&quot;. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 08:47, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

The problem is that not a lot of users venture out of their own book, and it would be great if you would be one who helps keep things orderly rather than complaining about how things aren't. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:36, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: I'm not complaining, and it worries me that you interpret it as such. Be aware that the word &quot;criticism&quot; does not necessarily imply a &quot;complaint&quot;. I'm just trying to sort things out. I'm just not sure that I've come up with the best method yet, and I don't want to change anything until I am. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:10, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

How about rather than putting down stuff like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{proposed}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; or &lt;nowiki&gt;{{enforced}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in every policy page, go out and just enforce these policies? [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:36, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

: To be fair, that template stuff was probably a mistake. It's no worse than it was before, but it's only marginally better. Since most of the policies here have been (inappropriately) forked from Wikipedia, I figured I'd copy Wikipedia's current system for policy, hoping it might make a difference. I was wrong. Problem is there are far too many policy documents, they are not always clearly identified as such, and no-one has actually read them all. I feel a massive merge and delete operation coming along soon.

: On a personal note, can I inquire as you your age, sex and location, since it's not on your user page. It might be easier to communicate, since I could alter my dialect to use metaphors more common to you. (e.g. using the US Constitution as a metaphor is obviously more effective for people of US origin). - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 13:10, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

:: I'd rather not disclose that here, for personal reasons, although you will invariably find what you are looking for on the MW projects. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 06:39, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

::: Apologies for not looking. Your Wikipedia user page is slightly clearer, and tends to indicate you are a Canadian immigrant from a Chinese-speaking nation. Based on your contributions and use of language, I'm guessing that you are male, and between the ages of 14 and 24. - [[User:Aya|Aya]] 08:16, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

== English language ==

English is not the official language of the UK. There isn't one! Although, of course, it is ''conventional'' to speak English. See the article on the United Kingdom on wikipedia. --[[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 14:24, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks for the correction. I've updated [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#How to write effective policy documents]] appropriately. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:40, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

== Revising Wikibook policy standards ==

OK, I'm going to betray my ethnic background somewhat here, but my country got into a big pickle when we tried to adopt previous institutions that were inherited from the &quot;parent&quot; country, and found out the hard way that the whole thing was so screwed up that it was totally unworkable. In short, we tossed out the entire body of law and started anew.  The resulting document was the United States Consitituion. - [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:38, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

: First of all, a sincere thankyou for your extensive, and well thought out contribution. Based on your comments and your apparent timezone, I'm assuming you're a US citizen, and the 'parent country' to which you refer is the UK. Please correct me if I'm wrong. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

In the same vein, Wikibooks may have to do exactly this as well.  We know the founding principles of what got Wikibooks going, and I don't want to betray that at all.  At the same time, this is not Wikipedia, and there needs to be a way to &quot;declare independence&quot; from Wikipedia and its policies as well.  We are still under the umbrella of the Wikimedia Foundation, but it is only the Wikimedia board that we should be obligated to please.

Furthermore, there has been a couple of years of hard won experience here at Wikibooks.  What has worked, what hasn't, and where should we go?  In this regard you are doing us all a big favor Aya, by taking this issue by the horns and trying to make something of this work.  The #1 issue that I would see, however, is that something of this scope needs to include more than just en.wikibooks.  We need to get the other languages involved in setting general broad policies governing Wikibooks and its relationship to the other Wikimedia sister projects.

I've long complained (for a couple of months or so, I guess) that Wikibooks has become the dumping ground for projects that the other sister projects don't want to deal with.  The 1911 Encyclopedia is a classic example of this, and was (unfortunately) suggested by one of the participants on Meta.  By establishing firm policies as to what is and is not proper content that can be placed on here, we can clean up Wikibooks and make it a jewel that it can become.

Wikibooks is also at a transition.  New blood is coming into Wikibooks, and there seems to be a slight clash of cultures going on right now.  As for myself, I would not have been involved with Wikimedia projects if it weren't for Wikibooks.  I looked at Wikipedia several years ago (more than one), and even poked around at the content, but never felt compelled to get involved.  After reading several Wikipedia entries from Slashdot, and an article about Wikibooks, I finally had a book idea that was digging into me and I had to write.  [[Programming:Serial Data Communications]] is the result of that initial effort (and I'm not done). - [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:38, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

: Seems as if you've pretty much come to the same conclusions as I. I had taken a slight break from writing this document, while I did some research on other Wikimedia projects, to see how they deal with these problems. During this time I discovered extreme content overlap with other wikis, and have tried to address these by creating [[m:Directory]] as an authoritative index of Wikimedia projects, languages, wikis, and appropriate content. As for authoritative policies, I've made a start on [[m:Policy]]; the idea being to move all policy, and debate thereof, from each individual project, to Meta. I feel as if this was the intended purpose for Meta anyway (read [[m:Meta:About]]). In effect, this would mean that most pages in the 'project namepace' (e.g. the Wikipedia namespace on the Wikipedia project) ought to be moved to Meta.

: The main problem I am now facing is the classic 'tradition' vs. 'evolution' conflict. (e.g. [[w:Wikipedia talk:Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense#Votes for Transwiki]]). It seems people would rather carry on in the current tradition of chaotic scope and policy, rather than allowing it to evolve into something more meaningful and well-defined; the reason being that for convenience, long-term users would prefer things to stay the same, whereas new users would prefer the content to be in more obvious locations. In this particular case, perhaps the correct thing to do would have been to just ignore what other people think, be bold, and just do it, but I have a feeling my changes would be reverted, and it would thus be a waste of my time.

: The other problem is that Meta is a complete mess. There are too many pages which are out-of-date, and too many on the same subject which contradict each other. I'm beginning to think Meta needs to be redesigned from the ground up, but I don't think it's something I can get done by myself. I'm still pondering various ideas, but in the interim, I'd be grateful for any suggestions you might have on the subject. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

Carry on, Aya.  I'll try to make some comments about some specific points you have raised later.  - [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:38, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

: That would also be appreciated. I stick by the idea that even where pages should contain all users POVs, it should retain a single editor (preferably one who is well-versed in the finer points of language) to ensure it has a meaningful structure, and maintains consistent language use throughout. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Low-carb diet''' is a general term referring to numerous specific diets which advocate for a reduction of [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrate]] intake, as a healthier balance of foods. The concept is based in the fact that [[Cookbook:Cereal Grain|grain]]-based foods cause the body to store the fat it consumes, rather than to burn it for fuel. Low-carb diets, in various prescriptions, favor &quot;complex carbs&quot; (vegetables) over &quot;simple carbs,&quot; (grains and starches), while also reducing the consumption of saturated fat in favor of [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|unsaturated fat]].

The [[Cookbook:Atkins Diet Cooking|Atkins Diet]] is the most well-known and heavily marketed low-carb diet, though its specified prescriptions for regimented protein intake are controversial. The [[w:South Beach diet|South Beach diet]] is also well known, though more generalized. The [[Cookbook:Zone diet|Zone diet]] is controversial because it prescribes a balance between carbs, fat, and protein according to a &quot;40:30:30&quot; ratio. 

It's important to note that both the Atkins and Zone diets are controversial, due to the specific claims or prescriptions they make. Further, both are business trade names for diets, and are considered proprietary and licensed franchises (though to a different degree). However, the basic general principles of low-carb dieting are not intellectual property, and likewise the general ideas about proportions and balance in these specific diets are free to examine and learn from.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{IPA notice}}

Portuguese alphabet, like in other [[w:Romance languages|Romance languages]] has a natural evolution from Latin and so it is not strictly phonetic and has some features inherited from its history. Although, compared to English or even French it is easy to read and not so hard to write. 

==Letters==

The sounds are better explained in the next chapters.

Glossary:
* '''Coda''': the sounds in a syllable after the vowel, for example '''t''' in spi'''t''';
* '''Onset''': the sounds in a syllable before the vowel, for example '''sp''' in '''sp'''it;
* '''Nucleus''': the vowel of a syllable;
* '''Glide''': the sounds /j/ and /w/;
* '''Stressed''': (of a syllable) which is pronounced more emphatically, for example com'''poun'''ding.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''fraction''' is most easily thought of as representing some ''portion'' of a unit.

The simplest fractions to think about are numbers like &quot;one half&quot; or &quot;one tenth.&quot; For example, ''one third'' is the number you get when you divide ''one'' into three equal parts and take one of them.

We write ''one third'' as &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Every fraction looks like that, having an integer on top, which we call the '''numerator''', and an integer on the bottom, which we call the '''denominator'''. This ''fractional notation'' represents the number that we get when we divide the numerator by the denominator. In our simple examples we had a numerator of 1.

So, what do we mean by the expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;?

When we read this in English, we say &quot;two thirds.&quot;  That sounds like we have &quot;two&quot; of something, namely two &quot;thirds&quot; or two of: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, which we naturally think of as &lt;math&gt;2 * \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.  But in our more technical definition of a fraction we said it was a number we get by dividing a pair of integers, so that &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; is ''defined'' as &lt;math&gt;2\div3&lt;/math&gt;.

Well fortunately for our intuitions, it will turn out that &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thinking about a fraction as some portion of a unit works nicely so long as the numerator is less than the denominator.  But what do we mean by &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}&lt;/math&gt;?  Well, intuitively, we think of having four of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, which, thinking about huge slices of cake, must surely be equal to &lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;. And, sure enough, if you do the division of 4 by 3 you'll end up with 1.33333..., which is 1 + 0.3333... or &lt;math&gt;1 + \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Fractions can represent whole numbers, too.  Nothing but our boring desire for simplicity and clarity keeps us from writing 12 as &lt;math&gt;\frac{120}{10}&lt;/math&gt; whenever we like.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Division can thought of a reverse multiplication of sorts, where you find how many numbers go into another numnber. 

Division is usually in the format:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; (two divided by four) OR
&lt;math&gt;2/4=x&lt;/math&gt;

For an example:

We want to find out what 100 '''divides by'''. We start with 1. 
We know that &lt;math&gt;1*100=100&lt;/math&gt; So 100 is divisible by 1.

And we find that &lt;math&gt;2*50=100&lt;/math&gt; So 100 is divisible by 2.

But &lt;math&gt;3*33.33=99.99&lt;/math&gt; So 3 isn't. We can't divide 100 by 3 to get a straight answer.

So we go onto 4. &lt;math&gt;4*25=100&lt;/math&gt; So 100 is divisible by 4. 

And so on for each number. But this format takes too long, so we go:

&lt;math&gt;100/4=25&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a right angled triangle, Sine is the opposite side of the angle needed divided by hypotenuse; so:
&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta=\frac{o}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
An equation with Sine would be the following, when the opposite is equal to 5 and the hypotenuse is equal to 10:
&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta = \frac{o}{h}&lt;/math&gt;
= 
&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta\ = \frac{5}{10} = .47942&lt;/math&gt; 


Sine is usually used for triangle with the angle in the corner of lower point of the hypotenuse.

Sine can also be reversed, to find out the length of the sides when you have the angle already.

This can be used by going &lt;math&gt;\sin ^-x =\frac{2}{h}&lt;/math&gt;, where x is the angle you have, and h is the side you want to get.

Why merge this almost empty article? Shouldn't it better just be removed?

:This was part of an edit conflict, but in general the philosophy is that this is to become a reference manual, while the Serial Programming Wikibooks is more of a step-by-step textbook.  There is an important distinction between the two, and the textbook is much harder to write, to be honest.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:24, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia]] 

'''Damper''' is Australian bushman's bread, made while camping or &quot;waltzing matilda&quot; (carrying a swag around looking for work). It is meant to be made outside by a campfire.

==Ingredients==

* 1 large cup [[cookbook:Flour|self-raising flour]]
* generous pinch of [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 1/4 cup [[cookbook:water|water]] [[Image:Mustering camp.jpg|250px|thumb|Damper and camp oven used, Walcha, NSW]]

==Procedure==
# Add salt to flour.
# Add scant 1/4 cup water (more and it will be as tough as an old boot).
# [[cookbook:Mix|Mix]] and form into a round loaf.
# Dig a foot-deep hole near a fire and add 2 shovels of hot coals and ash. 
# Add damper mixture to a greased [[cookbook:Dutch Oven|camp oven]] (traditional cast iron round pot with lid).
# Cook for maximum of 40 minutes. If undercooked it will be flat and rubbery.
# Your first try may be inedible. Keep trying, you'll soon be an expert.

==Variations==
* This cookbook also has a [[Cookbook:Drover's Damper|Drover's damper]] recipe.
* You can do this in a barbecue grill with mixture in greased metal foil as well. During cooking, damper increases volume by 1/3 to 1/2, so allow room for expansion.
* If you aren't outdoors, just add mixture to  greased oven tray and cook in a moderate oven for 30 - 40 minutes.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australian Cuisine]] 

'''Drover's Damper''' is Australian bread, made by stockmen while taking care of or rounding up stock. It is meant to be made outside by a campfire. This is the &quot;flash&quot; version, made when butter and milk is available.

==Ingredients==

* 2 cups [[cookbook:Flour|self-raising flour]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 2 teaspoons [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 1 tablespoon [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 1 cup [[cookbook:milk|milk]] [[Image:Mustering camp.jpg|250px|thumb|Damper and camp oven used, Walcha, NSW]]

==Procedure==

# Add salt to flour
# Add sugar
# Rub in butter.
# [[cookbook:Mix|Mix]] in milk to make a medium-soft dough.
# [[cookbook:Knead|Knead]] lightly on flat surface until smooth.
# Pat into a round shape.
# Place damper mixture on coals or hot ash.
# Cook for maximum of 40 minutes.  
# Discard burnt outside and eat the inside.
# Serve with [[cookbook:butter|butter]], ([[cookbook:Golden Syrup|golden syrup]]) or [[cookbook:jam|jam]].

==Variations==
* This cookbook also has an [[Cookbook:Damper|&quot;ordinary&quot; damper]] recipe.
* You can do this using a hole near the fire in a greased [[cookbook:dutch oven|camp oven]] or greased [[cookbook:aluminium foil|aluminium foil]] in a barbecue.
* If you aren't outdoors, just add mixture to greased bread tin, [[cookbook:glaze|glaze]] with [[cookbook:milk|milk]] and cook in a hot oven, reducing heat until cooked (20 minutes).
* You can add dried [[cookbook:fruit|fruit]] - then it's &quot;[[cookbook:Johnny Cake|Johnny Cake]]&quot;.
* As a variation, add grated [[cookbook:cheese|cheese]].
* Use [[cookbook:beer|beer]] instead of milk for &quot;Beer Damper&quot;.

    1.  General considerations 
        a.  Evaluation of patients for interventional  proceduresrequires a knowledge  of appropriate  indications and contraindications, objectives, alternatives,  and possible  complications.  Coordination with the  referring physician is essential to ensure appropriate  patient selection and, for biopsy, appropriate approach. 

    2.  Arthrography, major joints 
        a.  Shoulder 
        b.  Hip (including prosthesis evaluation) 
        c.  Wrist (radiocarpal joint) 

    3.  Arthrography, less common sites 
        a.  Wrist (midcarpal joint, distal radioulnar joint) 
        b.  Spinal facet 
        c.  Sacroiliac 
        d.  Knee

Often, your script will need to get information from the user, such as parameter settings, before performing its action. You can do this in two different ways: either present a modal popup that the user has to deal with before doing anything else, or alternatively you can take over the entire Scripts Window with a custom display that the user can freely switch to and from while doing other things.

==A Modal GUI==
The simplest way to add a GUI to your script is to pop up a simple menu with some items to choose from. Let’s add an option to our Tetrahedron Maker script to generate the tetrahedron upside-down. Displaying a menu is as simple as calling &lt;TT&gt;Blender.Draw.PupMenu&lt;/TT&gt; and passing it a string containing the menu items separated by “|” characters. Put a “%t” at the end of the item that defines the menu title:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Orient = Blender.Draw.PupMenu(&quot;Add Tetrahedron%t|Right Way Up|Upside Down&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
The value returned from the call will be the index of the selected menu item (starting from 1, ignoring the menu title), or -1 to indicate that no selection was made.

When you execute the above line, it displays this:
[[File:Blender249PopupMenuExample.png|center]]

We will use the menu selection to negate a scale factor which will be applied to the Z coordinate of the vertices of the tetrahedron. But only the last vertex has a nonzero Z coordinate, so this is the only one that needs a change in its computation. So the body of our script now looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Orient = Blender.Draw.PupMenu(&quot;Add Tetrahedron%t|Right Way Up|Upside Down&quot;)
if Orient &gt; 0 :
    Scale = -1 if Orient &gt; 1 else 1
    NewMesh = Blender.Mesh.New(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
    NewMesh.verts.extend \
      (
        [
            (0, -1 / math.sqrt(3),0),
            (0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0),
            (-0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0),
            (0, 0, Scale * math.sqrt(2 / 3)),
        ]
      )
    NewMesh.faces.extend \
      (
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 3]]
      )
    TheObj = Blender.Object.New(&quot;Mesh&quot;, &quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
    TheObj.link(NewMesh)
    TheScene = Blender.Scene.GetCurrent()
    TheScene.link(TheObj)
    TheScene.update()
    Blender.Window.Redraw()
#end if
&lt;/source&gt;

==A Modeless GUI==

It is very easy to create a GUI for your script, and that way make it easy to change aspects of it for everyone.

The command to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is:

&lt;pre&gt;Blender.Draw.Register(draw,event,button)&lt;/pre&gt;

This command registers the functions:
* draw - to draw the GUI
* event - to action mouse and key presses
* button - to action GUI button presses

'''However, this command will NOT work by itself !!!'''. You first need to define these 3 functions.


First we will import Blender's library of built in functions:
&lt;pre&gt;import Blender&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Next, we will define the draw function'''.
&lt;pre&gt;def draw():&lt;/pre&gt;
Inside this function we will draw the GUI.  Here is an example of a drawing function we can use.  It will clear the current window.
&lt;pre&gt;	Blender.BGL.glClear(Blender.BGL.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)&lt;/pre&gt;
And the next command will draw a button.  Note that the first number in the command, '1' identifies the button as '''button 1'''.  We will refer to this button later.
&lt;pre&gt;	Blender.Draw.Toggle(&quot;Clear origin&quot;,1,10,20,100,20,0,&quot;Tooltip&quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Next, we will define the event function'''.  The code of a key pressed on the keyboard is passed into the function as the variable '''evt'''.
&lt;pre&gt;def event(evt,val):&lt;/pre&gt;
Now we will test to see if the escape key is pressed:
&lt;pre&gt;	if evt == Blender.Draw.ESCKEY:&lt;/pre&gt;
If it is pressed, exit the script, and return from the function:
&lt;pre&gt;		Blender.Draw.Exit()
		return &lt;/pre&gt;

'''Next, we will define the button function'''.  This function will perform an action if the button is pressed.
&lt;pre&gt;def button(evt):&lt;/pre&gt;
Now test the variable '''evt''' which holds the button number that we previously identified.
&lt;pre&gt;	if evt == 1:&lt;/pre&gt;
If it is pressed, we will move the selected object in the 3d window back to the centre and redraw the screen:
&lt;pre&gt;		Blender.Scene.GetCurrent().getActiveObject().loc = (0,0,0)
		Blender.Window.Redraw()&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Lastly, we can create the Graphical User Interface''' by typing the command:

&lt;pre&gt;Blender.Draw.Register(draw,event,button)&lt;/pre&gt;


That's it !!! To enter the script yourself, type the following into the Text Editor window in Blender, and then press '''alt p''' to execute the script.  Here's the entire script.  Everything after the hash # is a comment and can be left out.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;import Blender  # This will import the library of blender functions we will use

def draw():     # Define the draw function (which draws your GUI).
	Blender.BGL.glClear(Blender.BGL.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) # This clears the window
        # Add here drawing commands to draw your GUI, for example:
	Blender.Draw.Toggle(&quot;Clear origin&quot;,1,10,20,100,20,0,&quot;Tooltip&quot;)
	# The line above will draw a toggle button.
	# Note the first number, '1' means this is button number 1
	
def event(evt,val):  # Define mouse and keyboard press events
	if evt == Blender.Draw.ESCKEY: # Example if esc key pressed
		Blender.Draw.Exit()    # then exit script
		return                 # return from the function

def button(evt):     # Define what to do if a button is pressed, for example:
	if evt == 1: # If button '1' is pressed, set active object to centre:
		Blender.Scene.GetCurrent().getActiveObject().loc = (0,0,0)
		Blender.Window.Redraw() # This will redraw the 3d window.

# You can now run the Graphical User Interface by typing the command:

Blender.Draw.Register(draw,event,button)

# End of script&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Noob Note: When I tried to run that script it came up with an error: Attribute Error: 'Scene' object has no attribute 'getActiveObject'. I changed &quot;Blender.Scene.GetCurrent().getActiveObject().loc = (0,0,0)&quot; to &quot;Blender.Scene.GetCurrent()&lt;b&gt;.objects.active&lt;/b&gt;.loc = (0,0,0)&quot; and it worked.

A changed kbcheck that will check all connected keyboards and will sort out some invalid devices that appear to be keyboards.

It should be noted that this script will stop and return on the first keyboard that has a key that is pressed. Perhaps this could be modified so that the sum of all checked keyboards is returned and so if you are pressing a key on one keyboard you can also be pressing another key on another keyboard and get both responses.

&lt;pre&gt;
function [keyIsDown,secs, keyCode] = KbCheck(deviceNumber)
% [keyIsDown,secs,keyCode] = KbCheck([deviceNumber])
%
% Return keyboard status (keyIsDown), time (secs) of the status check, and
% keyboard scan code (keyCode).
%
%    keyIsDown      1 if any key, including modifiers such as &lt;shift&gt;,
%                   &lt;control&gt; or &lt;caps lock&gt; is down. 0 otherwise.
%
%    secs           time of keypress as returned by GetSecs.
%
%    keyCode        Mac: a 128-element logical array.  Each bit within the
%                   logical array represents one keyboard key. If a key is
%                   pressed, its bit is set, othewise the bit is clear. To
%                   convert a keyCode to a vector of key numbers use
%                   FIND(keyCode). To find a key's keyNumber use KbName
%                   or KbDemo.
%
%                   Win: a 256-element array. It seems that the first
%                   128 elements correspond to the
%                   ascii sequence of the characters, and may be consistent
%                   with the Mac key codes.
%
% KbCheck and KbWait determine whether any key is down now, including the
% meta keys: &lt;caps lock&gt;, &lt;shift&gt;, &lt;command&gt;, &lt;control&gt;, and &lt;option&gt;. The
% only key not reported is the start key (triangle) used to power on your
% computer.
%
% GetChar and CharAvail are character-oriented (and slow), whereas KbCheck
% and KbWait are keypress-oriented (and fast). If only a meta key was hit,
% KbCheck will return true, because a key was pressed, but CharAvail will
% return false, because no character was generated. See GetChar.
%
% KbCheck and KbWait are MEX files, which take time to load when they're
% first called. They'll then stay loaded until you flush them (e.g. by
% changing directory or calling CLEAR MEX).
%
% OS X: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% KbCheck uses the PsychHID function, a general purpose function for
% reading from the Human Interface Device (HID) class of USB devices.
%
% OS 9: ___________________________________________________________________
%
% Command-Period causes an immediate exit.
%
% The Mac OS Event Manager detects and queues typed characters in the
% background. GetChar will return any characters typed before the  call to
% GetChar. FlushEvents can be used to clear the character event  buffer
% read by GetChar. Unlike GetChar, KbCheck only reports keys  depressed at
% the moment KbCheck is called.  FlushEvents has no effect  on KbCheck.
%
% Hitting CapsLock makes KbCheck and KbWait think that you're holding the
% shift key down. They will continue to think so (returning 1) until you
% release the shift by hitting CapsLock again.
%
% KbCheck and KbWait detect that a key is down by using the low-level Mac
% OS call GetKeys. It's not clear what temporal accuracy this provides, but
% it's much better than going through the higher-level Event Manager. Our
% impression from reading the documentation in Dan Costin's KeMo package
% web http://psychtoolbox.org/kemo.html
% &lt;ftp://ftp.stolaf.edu/pub/macpsych/KemMo_1.5.sit.hqx&gt; is that this
% low-level call still has uncertainty on the order of 11 ms because of the
% way the Mac OS polls ADB devices. Someone clever could probably use his
% advice to develop MEX files that timed keypresses more  accurately than
% KbCheck does.

This is a simple recipe for baked sweet potatoes.

==Ingredients==
*4 large &quot;yam style&quot; [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potatoes]]

==Procedure==
#Scrub the sweet potatoes very well. (do not peel) 
#Place into large glass baking dish. Cover loosely with [[Cookbook:Aluminium foil|aluminum foil]]. 
#Place into pre-heated 400°F (205°C) oven. 
#Bake for 90 minutes or until very soft. 

That's all there is to it and it is so so so good!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is how I installed {{w|SugarCRM}} on a new PC:

* Download the four Fedora Core 4 image files and make install CD’s
* Install Fedora Core 4 using the standard “Workstation” settings (don’t use the Server setup as it will put all the [[Apache]], [[PHP]], and [[MySQL]] files in the wrong place.  Enable Firewall, Enable SELinux, Install Default Software Packages)
* Finish Installing, Reboot, Login as ‘root’
* After booting, click Desktop -&gt; Security -&gt; Security Level (if using Gnome GUI), check the box next to WWW (HTTP), click OK to close.
* Launch WEB browser
* From http://www.mysql.com/ download the v4.1.12 MySQL Linux x86 RPM Files, you will need the Server, Client Program, Libraries &amp; Headers, and Dynamic Client Libraries.
* From http://www.php.net/ download PHP 4.3.11 (tar.gz)
* From http://www.apache.org/ download Apache 2.0.54 (tar.gz)
* Copy downloaded files to /usr/src directory
* Open a terminal window,  Applications -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Terminal
* Type the following in the terminal to install MySQL
 #cd /usr/src
 #rpm -i MySQL* 		(don’t worry if MySQL fails to start)
 #mysql_install_db
 #mysqld_safe &amp;
 &lt; hit enter again &gt;

* Now set the root password for MySQL
 #mysqladmin –u root password ‘enter-new-root-password-in-single-quotes’

* Now check to see if install was successful
 #mysqlshow –p
 Enter Password:

You should see something like:

 Databases
 ---------
 mysql
 test

* Now we need to set the ‘root’ password to the old password format and delete the blank user that was created automatically when MySQL was installed.
 #mysql –u root –p
 Enter Password:
 mysql&gt;SET PASSWORD FOR ‘root’@’localhost’=OLD_PASSWORD(‘New-Password’);
 mysql&gt;use mysql
 mysql&gt;delete from user where User=’’;
 mysql&gt;quit

* Now MySQL is installed and we need to install Apache and PHP. Type:
 #gzip –d httpd-2.0.54.tar.gz
 #tar xvf httpd-2.0.54.tar
 #gunzip php-4.3.11.tar.gz
 #tar -xvf php-4.3.11.tar
 #cd httpd-2.0.54
 #./configure --enable-so
 #make
 #make install
 #cd ../php-4.3.11
 #./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs \        (hit enter key)
  --with-mysql-sock=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
 #make
 #make install

* Now copy the php.ini file to the correct place
 #cp php.ini-dist /usr/local/lib/php.ini

* Edit the php.ini file
Search for: memory_limit = 8M,   change 8M to 16M
Save &amp; Close file

* Look for libphp4.so file in /usr/local/apache2/modules/ to make sure it’s there.
* Edit the Apache configuration file in /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

Find '''loadmodule''' and make sure this line was added, (or add)

 LoadModule php4_module modules/libphp4.so

Find '''addtype''' and add 

 AddType application/x-tar.tgz
 AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml
 AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

Find '''directoryindex''' and add '''index.php''' to the line:

 DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.html.var

* launch apache by typing in the terminal
 #/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start

If you get the following error: “ Cannot load /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp4.so into server: /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp4.so: cannot restore segment prot after reloc: Permission Denied”  
Type:
 #chcon –t shlib_t /usr/local/apache2/modules/libphp4.so

now try and start:
 #/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start

* Test Apache by opening a web browser and typing in http://localhost/ . You should see an apache success screen.
* Test PHP
Create a file in /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ named test.php and enter the following line in the file:

 &lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;

Save and close.
Set permissions on file to 755.
Now in a browser type http://localhost/test.php You should see a PHP information screen with your current settings.

* Edit MySQL’s my.cnf file
Edit or create the /etc/my.cnf file, make it look like the following:

 [mysqld]
 #use old password encryption method (needed for 4.0 and older clients).
 old-passwords
 basedir=/var/lib/mysql

Save and close file.

* Edit the MySQL startup file /etc/init.d/mysql

Find: '''basedir=/''' and change to:
 basedir=/var/lib/mysql

* restart MySQL by going clicking Desktop -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Server Settings -&gt; Services
select mysql, click restart

* create '''sugarsuite''' folder in /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
* copy the contents of the SugarCRM 3.0.1 folder (or latest) to the sugarsuite folder
* Set permissions on all files to 777 for installation. Type in a terminal:
 #chmod -R 777 /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/sugarsuite

** alternate instructions that worked great for me...
**
 #cd ..  [now in htdocs folder]
 #chown -R apache sugarsuite    [change file owner to the apache webserver]
 #cd sugarsuite   [back to sugar webroot]
 #chmod -R 775 cache custom data modules
** alternately #chmod -R 775 ./cache/ ./custom/ ./data/ ./modules/
 #chmod 664 config.php
**

* To install SugarCRM, open a browser and type http://localhost/sugarsuite/ 
* Follow install instruction: Create User, Create Datbase. Finish Installation.
* Set SugarCRM directory permissions in terminal window.
 #chmod -R 755 /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/sugarsuite
 #cd /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/sugarsuite
 #chmod -R 777 ./cache/ &lt; does not work!
 #chmod -R 777 ./custom/
 #chmod -R 777 ./data/
 #chmod -R 777 ./modules/
 #chmod -R 444 config.php

* Sugar install is finished!

* Now let’s add apache to the startup process. First. Let’s copy the apache startup file to the startup directory. Type in the terminal:
 #cp /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl /etc/init.d/

* Edit the /etc/init.d/apachectl file: Add the lines in bold.

 #1/bin/sh
 #
 '''#chkconfig: - 85 15'''
 '''#description: Apache is a Web server to serve HTML files and CGI.'''
 #
 #copyright (c) 2000-2004 The Apache Software Foundation

* To enable httpd to start automatically. Type in a terminal:
 #/sbin/chkconfig --add apachectl

* Reboot server to see if everything starts up and works!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==

The osteochondroses are a motley group of entities that were initially lumped together due to morphological similarity.  They often occur in children are associated with apparent fragmentation of bone in an epiphysis or apophysis.  With the perspective of time, we can now divide these entities into one of three rough groups: post-traumatic, osteonecrosis and normal variants of ossification.

== Kienböck's Disease ==

'''Definition:''' Avascular necrosis of the [[Wikipedia:lunate|lunate]] bone, one of the bones in the most proximal [[Wikipedia:carpal|carpal]] row.  It is also known as lunatomalacia.

Etiology: Idiopathic or secondary to repetitive trauma. Has been associated in the past past with negative ulnar variance, however this has been recently questioned.  The condition was first described in 1910 by a Viennese radiologist, Dr. Robert Kienböck.

'''Clinical Findings:'''

Many people with Kienböck’s disease believe they have a sprained wrist at first, usually after some form of trauma to the wrist, such as a fall. This type of trauma can disrupt the blood flow to the lunate. In most people, two vessels supply blood to the lunate, but in some people there is only one source. This puts them at greater risk for developing the disease. As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms are noted, including:

* A painful and sometimes swollen wrist
* Limited range of motion in the affected wrist (stiffness)
* Decreased grip strength in the hand
* Tenderness directly over the bone (on the top of the hand at about the middle of the wrist)
* Pain or difficulty in turning the hand upward

'''Stages of Disease:'''

Kienböck’s disease follows a specific progressive pattern through four stages.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|style=&quot;width:180px;&quot;|Stage 1: 
|style=&quot;width:1000px;&quot;| Symptoms similar to those of a wrist sprain. X-rays may be normal or show a line indicating a possible fracture. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be helpful in making the diagnosis in this early stage.
|-
|Stage 2: 
|Radiographs may demonstrate lunate sclerosis. Either an MRI or a computed tomography (CT) scan may be used to assess the condition of the bone. Recurrent pain, swelling and wrist tenderness are common.
|-
|Stage 3: 
|The avascular bone begins to collapse. The surrounding bones may begin to shift position. Patients experience increasing pain, weakness in gripping, and limited motion.
|-
|Stage 4: 
|The surfaces of adjoining bones are affected, resulting in arthritis of the wrist.
|}


'''Treatment:'''

In its early stages, Kienböck’s disease may be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are so similar to those of a sprained wrist and radiographic findings are often negative. Splinting or casting the wrist for two to three weeks is often attempted initially, as well as anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin or ibuprofen for pain relief.

Surgical options include bone grafting, bone leveling, proximal row carpectomy and eventually fusion procedures, but none are curative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Substitution methods are really applicable anywhere you can find a differential equation.  However, there's very few instances where you will always give a certain substitution.  You generally pick one and plug it in as needed.  So I'll give situations where you could use a substitution method, although you may later learn better methods.

== Parametric equations ==

One time where you may need it is when solving parametric equations.  Lets say we're given functions for velocity in two dimensions-  &lt;math&gt;v_x(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_y(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  If we want to solve for &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt;, you have to divide &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_y}{v_x}&lt;/math&gt;.  This works out to be &lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{dv_y}{dx}}{\frac{dv_x}{dx}}=\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.  When you do this, you will frequently (although not always) get a chance to use &lt;math&gt;\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt; substitution.

=== Constant velocity ===

Lets say we're swimming across a river with constant velocity &lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The river has no current.  We start swimming at an angle of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the shore.  Solve for &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt;

The first thing we need to do is break the velocity into x and y components.  This is fairly simple.

:&lt;math&gt;v_x=v_0cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_y=v_0sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Using simple trig, we can remove the theta.

:&lt;math&gt;v_x=v_0\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_y=v_0\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we divide the two to find &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{v_0\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}}{v_0\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}}=\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

Now this is simple to solve separably.  It could also be solved via substituion.  This is a trivial example, but it can be made more complicated.


=== Motion against a current ===

Imagine the same swimmer.  Now there is a current with speed r going straight up the river (positive y direction).  How does this change our example? 

The x component is still the same. 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=v_0cos(\theta)=\frac{v_0x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

And in the y direction we also have a term due to the current.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt}=v_0sin(\theta)+r=\frac{v_0y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}+r&lt;/math&gt;

You can get &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; by dividing the two equations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y}{x}+\frac{r\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{v_0x}&lt;/math&gt;

We can move the x into the root to simplify the equation a bit

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y}{x}+\frac{r\sqrt{\frac{x^2}{x^2}+\frac{y^2}{x^2}}}{v_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y}{x}+\frac{r}{v_0}\sqrt{1+\frac{y^2}{x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


Well, this complicated equation looks like a case for &lt;math&gt;\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt; substitution.

:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=vx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y'=v+v'x&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v+v'x=v+\frac{r}{v_0}\sqrt{1+v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v'=\frac{r}{xv_0}\sqrt{1+v^2}&lt;/math&gt;

That looks like a nice, easily solved separable equation.  Let solve it.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{\sqrt{1+v^2}}=\frac{r}{xv_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dv}{\sqrt{1+v^2}}=\int \frac{r}{xv_0}&lt;/math&gt;

The left end is an ugly integral.  Just trust me on it.

:&lt;math&gt;ln(v+\sqrt{1+v^2})=\frac{r}{v_0}ln(x)+C&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v+\sqrt{1+v^2}=e^{ln(x^{\frac{r}{v_0}})+C}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v+\sqrt{1+v^2}=Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

Lets try to get rid of that root.  Isolate it, and square both sides.

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+v^2}=Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}-v&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1+v^2=Cx^{2\frac{r}{v_0}}-2vCx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}+v^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2vCx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}=C^2x^{2\frac{r}{v_0}}-1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}}{2}-\frac{1}{2Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging in for v, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{y}{x}=\frac{Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}}{2}-\frac{1}{2Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}}&lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for y by multiplying through by x

:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}+1}}{2}-\frac{x}{2Cx^{\frac{r}{v_0}}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{C}{2}x^{\frac{r}{v_0}+1}-\frac{1}{2C}x^{\frac{-r}{v_0}+1}&lt;/math&gt;


This complicated equation does make sense-  the bigger the current, the further you go in the y direction as a portion of the x.

If you ever find an equation this evil in real life, do yourself a favor and buy a computer program to solve it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
When you think of the ancient cultures and the beginning of man, one of the first to come to mind are the Ancient Egyptians. Their culture still affects us to this day. You can find references from their religion and culture everywhere, whether it be the movies or the bible. The Egyptian culture has left us with great stories, tales and epics. The Egyptians started a lot of beliefs and traditions that we still practice to this day. They were probably the first civilization that believed in an afterlife, and the first to have any positive belief about it.

This page details some of the factors to take into account when choosing a new or used car.

[[Image:Ford Focus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Ford Focus, a car which scores highly under many criteria.]]

==What type of car do you need?==
Think carefully about what you actually need in a car. Do you need a sedan or would an SUV be sufficient? Will you use a four-wheel drive system? If you're covering long distances, fuel economy will be important. Will it be a statement of your personality?  Will you be using it to pick up your kids? Or do you just need a cheap runabout that goes (skip to the last section)? Read on to find out more.

==Points to consider==
Evaluate these points on a scale of personal preference. In other words, which features are more important for you and which ones matter less?

===Performance===
*What is the volume of the [[w:Internal_combustion_engine|engine]], in liters or cubic inches? How many cylinders does the engine have?
*Note the peak [[w:horsepower|horsepower]] and [[w:torque|torque]] ratings and at what [[w:Revolutions_per_minute|RPM]] the peaks occur. Note the top speed of the car.
*Does the car have a manual or automatic [[w:Transmission_%28mechanics%29|transmission]]? Is it a three-, four-, five- or six-speed? A greater number of gears in the transmission mean greater fuel efficiency at high speeds (due to lower RPMs) and faster acceleration times (due to the engine spending more time near its power peak.) Is it a [[w:Continuously_variable_transmission|continuously-variable transmission]]?
*Does the car come with four-wheel [[w:disc_brake|disc brakes]] or front disc and rear [[w:drum_brake|drum brakes]]?

===Safety===
*What safety equipment does the car have? Note the presence of [[w:crumple_zone|crumple zones]], pre-tensioning [[w:seat_belt|seatbelts]], number and locations of [[w:airbag|airbags]], child safety locks, integrated child seating and so on.
*How well does it score in the [http://www.euroncap.com Euro NCAP] test or the [http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ NHTSA] crash tests?
*Does the car possess [[w:Traction_control|traction control]] or a [[w:Vehicle_Stability_Control|stability control]] systems?
*Does the car come with [[w:Anti-lock_braking_system|anti-lock brakes]]?
*If the intended driver is petite, does it have adjustable pedals to place them a safe distance away from the airbag?

===Equipment===
*Is the car well equipped for its price?
*Do you prefer cloth or leather seating surfaces?
*Note the presence of power accessories, such as power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, and power seats.
*Does the car come with air conditioning? Is the [[w:climate_control|climate control]] system manual or automatic? Are there dual temperature controls?
*Examine the car's [[w:Car_audio|audio system]]. Note presence of AM/FM radio tuner, cassette deck, and/or CD player or changer. Some audio systems may have a line-in jack for external equipment such as an [[w:Mp3_player|MP3 player]]. How many speakers does the car have? Is there a subwoofer? What is the wattage rating of the audio system?
*Note the presence of other comfort and convenience features that are important to you. Note their cost if they are available as options.

===Quality and aesthetics===
*Does the manufacturer have a reputation for building quality vehicles that are not plagued by malfunctions?
*Do you like the design of the automobile? Is the exterior pleasing to the eye? What about the interior?

===Costs===
*Taking into consideration the car's size, class, and feature packages, is the car's price competitive with similar automobiles on the market?
*What kind of warranty does the manufacturer offer? Common warranty periods include 3-year/36,000 mile, 5-year/60,000 mile, and 10-year/100,000 mile. Be sure to note the difference between bumper-to-bumper warranties, which cover all parts in the automobile, and powertrain warranties, which only cover the engine and transmission. The latter will usually have longer warranty periods.
*How expensive will the car be to maintain and service? Are parts easily available?
*Does the car require [[w:synthetic_oil|synthetic oils]] and/or premium (high-[[w:octane_rating|octane]]) fuel?
*What will be the cost of insuring the car?
*Will the car depreciate significantly over a 3 or 5 year period, or does it hold its resale value well?

===Environmental impact===
[[File:Eletroposto Prius Insight1.jpg|thumb|3 hybrid cars: an early model Toyota Prius (far left), an early model Honda Insight (center) and a late model Toyota Prius (right).]]
*Is the car [[w:fuel_efficiency|fuel-efficient]]? Note its fuel consumption, in miles per gallon, or liters per 100 kilometers. Higher fuel efficiency results in lower fuel costs, but may also require a sacrifice in performance.
*Cars with [[w:hybrid vehicle|hybrid engines]], such as the Toyota Prius (right) have greater fuel efficiency in city cycles. However, it usually takes several years to recoup the hybrid car's price premium via saved fuel costs. 
*Is the car diesel-powered? Modern diesel engines are about 15% more efficient compared to gasoline engines and possess a greater amount of low-end torque, which aids in acceleration and towing. However, they generally have higher particulate emissions, such as soot.
*Consider the amount of emissions, such as [[w:carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide]], and [[w:NOx|oxides of nitrogen]], that are produced by the engine. In some countries, including the UK, cars with cleaner engines incur lower road tax charges.

==Test drive==
Once you think that a certain car may be right, go to the dealer and ask for a test drive - it shouldn't cost you anything. If possible drive on a range of roads - the motorway, in town, country lanes, and off-road if you're going for an SUV.

During the test drive, pay particular attention to these points:

===Performance===
*Note the car's acceleration. Is it satisfactory for your driving style? Do you feel you can safely merge onto a freeway?
*Evaluate the car's handling characteristics and whether they suit your driving style. Does the car possess [[w:understeer|understeer]] or [[w:oversteer|oversteer]] when turning into corners? Is the car steady at high speeds? Is the steering communicative and on-center or is it vague?
*How well does the car brake? How well does the car perform in panic stops?

===Quality and aesthetics===
*Observe the exterior of the car. Are the body panels flush with respect to each other? Are the gaps between panels small or large? Does the paint show signs of fading?
*Observe the interior of the car. Are the panels closely fitted? Do the plastic materials feel hard and cheap or are they soft to the touch? Do the controls feel cheap or do they have good tactile response?
*Is the instrumentation well-designed? Are all important controls located at a comfortable arm's reach?
*Do you find the seats comfortable?
*On the road, does the car feel solid or does it rattle over bumps? Observe noise, vibration, and harshness while coasting and accelerating.



==Comparing potential choices: an example==
One way to make your final choice is this:
#Make a list of three or four possible models within your budget.
#List all the qualities which are important to you, such as safety, equipment, boot / trunk space, and so on.
#Then award 3 points to the car best in each category, 2 to the second best, and 1 to the worst. If there were four cars you would award 4, 3, 2 and 1 point from best to worst.

If certain categories are more important (such as economy) you could award double or triple points , so the winner would get 6 or 9.

Here is an example, based on a choice between a &quot;VW Padro&quot;, a &quot;Holden Frisk&quot; and a &quot;Mitsubishi Morning Tea&quot;, rated under ten criteria. All the details, like the cars, are entirely fictitious.

{|

*The Padro gets    1+2+1+1+3+3+1+3+2+2=19 points
*The Frisk gets  3+3+3+2+2+3+2+2+1+2=24 points
*The Morning Tea gets 2+1+2+3+1+3+3+1+3+3=22 points
And so in this test, the '''Frisk''' is the best buy with 24 points. All three gained 3 points for safety as this was a draw; both the Padro and the Frisk gained 2 points for the warranty because they both offered a 3-year warranty.

==Renting a car before buying it==
Regardless of your initial opinion of a vehicle, it might be a good idea to rent the same model for a few days before deciding to buy it. This precaution has several advantages:

#No hassle from dealership sales people. Renting allows you to drive the car when you want, how you want, and where you want. You have the freedom to take the time to &quot;learn&quot; the car: it's positives and negatives. You'll be able to determine whether the vehicle will meet your needs. You will also know whether you will have the visibility and the confidence and comfort to drive the vehicle.
#You'll be making a minimal investment in a rental vehicle. You will be making a financial commitment to another vehicle over the next two or three years or even longer (depending on whether you purchase or lease).
#If something should break down while driving the rental vehicle, most rental companies will be able to assist you. At the dealership, all you'll hear will be excuses about why the car broke down.
#You can make an objective evaluation of the vehicle without the pressure from a salesperson. Typically, rentals are a minimum of one day or even for a weekend so you'll have lots of time to determine whether this is the vehicle for you.

Once you've chosen the vehicle you (and your family, if applicable) feel most comfortable with, go to the dealership and test drive the new model to reinforce why you are choosing that particular vehicle. And if it's a used vehicle, be sure to arrange to have your mechanic do an inspection to ensure you aren't buying &quot;someone else's problem(s)&quot;.

==Cheap and older cars==
If you are a student, or are on a limited budget, sometimes the main issue can be the mechanical condition of the car. In this case, you will want a car that will pass safety testing and not break down, while not breaking the bank. Different countries have different safety standards that the cars must pass; It may be a good idea to find a list of things your country tests before allowing a car on the road. This will eliminate any nasty surprises. There are also quite a few things to check, so prioritisation may help.
Some of this advice may also apply to motorbikes.

===Traps for newbies===
The number of kilometers or miles that a vehicle has done does not indicate its condition. A car that has done a lot of city driving with 100,000km on the clock may be a lot more worn than a car that has done 300,000km of highway driving. A question you might ask the seller is &quot;how often was the car serviced?&quot;, &quot;do you have the receipts to prove it?&quot;. If the car has been well looked after, especially if the owner is a car enthusiast the owner may tell you a bit about the history and repairs the car has undergone. Of course this is a big unknown if the seller didn't own it for very long. The world record for the longest number of miles a car has done is 2.6 million miles, accomplished in a Volvo 1800. The owner claims he simply services the car regularly.

It is also a good idea to ask if the car has been in an accident.  You may or may not get an honest answer.  However, if the owner tells you that the car was in an accident, ask about the extent of the damage, how it was repaired, and if the owner has the estimate or the bill from the company that made the repairs; this will give you a better idea of the extent of the damage.  Be cautious if you learn that the car's frame was bent, however slightly, in an accident.  A bent frame cannot usually be fully repaired, and it can become worse as the car ages.
Be aware that the car you are interested in may have been involved in a major accident or event. Written off by insurance companies as total losses due to salt water damage (Katrina) or rebuilt from salvage using several cars.

===Engine condition===

====Mechanics====
Generally there are a couple of things that can go wrong.

* Loss of compression due to burnt valves or very worn piston rings
* Damaged bearings (on the crankshaft)
* Cam belt breaks (yikes!)

Loss of compression will cause the engine to stall if not idled at unusually high revs. This is usually caused by burnt valves or very worn piston rings. Burnt valves are usually not expensive to repair, but may indicate poor maintenance elsewhere.
Damaged bearings are caused by the car running low on oil.
Ask the owner when the cam or timing belt was last replaced. Cam or timing belts usually last around 80,000km or 5 years. Check the owners manual for specific belt replacement times.
If you are lucky and have &quot;''Free running''&quot; valves, a broken timing belt will only leave you stranded on the roadside. If you have &quot;''Interference''&quot; type valves a broken timing belt may can cause the heads of the valves to impact the tops of the piston often resulting in very expensive repairs. It is advisable to check with the dealer or manufacturer to check which type of valve is used. '''Always''' change the timing belt on engines with interference valves at the recommended interval.

====Exhaust====
Put your hand on the exhaust. There should be a good pressure build up, or there is a leak/hole in the exhaust somewhere. (Basically your hand should be forced off)

After doing this, sniff your hand (Sniffing the exhaust directly is not recommended!).
If there is a smell of petrol, the car is running rich. If it wasn't already, try this again later when the car is warmed up (5-10 minute drive usually does it). If the exhaust still smells you could get better fuel economy by getting it tuned.

If the car is emitting white smoke, this is normal (it is actually steam). If the car is emitting blue tinged smoke, then the car is burning oil. This indicates significant engine wear. Ask the owner how often they have to top up the oil. If it uses all its oil within a couple of thousand kms or miles, the engine may be on its last legs. If you don't use it much and it's a really cheap car it may still be worth it, however.

If the car burns oil continuously, then the piston rings are worn. If you, for example, take your foot off the accelerator while going downhill and then accelerate at the bottom and a puff of smoke comes out the back, then the valve guides are worn. (Get a friend to follow you in another car to confirm the latter.)

Piston rings are expensive to replace, valve guides can usually be ignored. But do ask the owner how often they top up the oil and how much they put in. If they never check the oil, check it yourself! It might be empty or very dirty! (Which could lead to a lot of expensive wear)

====Engine noise====
There are a lot of normal engine noises. If there is a noise that sounds suspicious (such a loud rattling) use your judgement, or ask a mechanic. A roughly running engine may only require a tune up or it may have expensive damage. If the seller claims it only requires a tune up, ask why they haven't done so, and be very suspicious without a second opinion. Claiming an engine only requires a tune up is a very common excuse for much more serious damage.

A rattling noise can mean the cam chain (if the car doesn't have a cam belt) is loose. It may require adjusting or replacement. If you think of an engine as a rectangular shape, the cam chain is at one of the ends.

A ticking noise can simply mean that the tappets require adjustment. This is usually normal if a car has not been serviced in a long time. Tappet adjustment is not a difficult task if you are into fixing things.

A rumbling noise in the bottom of the engine can indicate worn bearings. This can be expensive to replace.

Knocking noises are hard to distinguish. They indicate a lean fuel mixture or the car running on a lower octane fuel than it was designed. This can lead to burnt valves.

===Car condition===

====Springs====
To make sure your springs and dampeners (shock absorbers) are in good condition, push the car down HARD on each of its four corners. If the car acts like a spring, i.e. it bounces up and down, then the shock absorbers are worn. The car should rise back up after pushing down, but bounce very little or not at all. 

If the car has been lowered, ask the owner if the springs have been cut. In order to lower a car, a common trick is to cut a section out of the springs. This makes the springs shorter, thus lowering the car. This is very cheap and arguably dangerous, especially if a poor job was done.

====Brakes====
If the car has vacuum braking (or 'power' brakes) the brake pedal should depress easily for a bit and then harden up.
If the car doesn't have vacuum braking, then the brakes will not be extremely easy to depress for the first bit.
If the brake pedal feels soft, kind of spongy, there may be air in the brake lines. You can basically 'pump up' the brakes if this is the case. Try pumping the brakes several times, and they will go from spongy to hard. This is usually easily fixed, take a note to see a mechanic; ask them if the brakes just need bleeding.

If the car squeals when you brake, it could mean the brake pads are worn to the bone so to speak. If the car has disc brakes (most cars do, at least on the two front wheels) you will see a metallic disc behind the wheel with a brick shaped clamp around it. If you take a close look from behind the brick, you will see the disc in the middle, and two plates on either side. If you get a friend to press the brakes, the plates will push onto the middle disc.
If the plates have a smaller piece of material sticking out in between them and the disc (looks a bit like solid sandpaper) that's the pads themselves and it means there's some left.

====Wheel Bearings====
If the car's wheel bearings are worn, there will be a rumbling sound audible from the tire when the car is rolling.

====C.V. Joints====
If the car makes a click click noise when you turn with the steering wheel fully locked, it indicates wear of the CV joints. This can be comparatively expensive to fix if the car is cheap.
This only applies to front wheel drive or 4 wheel drive vehicles.

====Rust====
This totally depends on the safety test of your country. Generally cars that have noticeable amounts of rust are going to get worse, fast! The exception is if they are garaged which may slow the process.
Some specific areas prone to rust that may become safety concerns should be investigated these are:
-brake lines especially in locations where salt and sand accumulates. 
-gas tanks. Look for rust along the top of the tank and any welded seams where salt and sand will sit. Wet areas and the smell of gasoline will indicate seepage. 
- holes in the body that access the passenger compartment. Lift up carpeting and liners especially in the trunk area and look for signs of road dust. 
-front and rear suspension towers. These are the large pockets in the car body that house and provide support points for the coil springs and struts. When these become seriously rusted they may collapse. Repair is often expensive or impossible.
- areas around the pillars (these hold the roof up)and are difficult to repair
- areas of the frame or reinforcing channels on unibody cars exposed to salt and sand.
If in doubt get an expert opinion. If there is a bit of general minor rust you're probably ok, but if there is significant rusting, you may not pass the safety inspection.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==What I think makes Gambas hard to use.==

The only thing I find hard about Gambas is the lack of good
tutorials.

Take the &quot;goto&quot; tutorial for example.
I think this it is a very bad example on how to use the goto command.

Why? Because after studying it I still have trouble using the goto command.
What would have been better is if the example just showed me how to goto a certain part.

like this:

*a = print &quot;hello&quot;
*goto a

or 

*a = print &quot;hello&quot;
*b = print &quot;gamabs&quot;

*goto a then b
*goto b then a



Edit 10/3/06


First be aware that goto is bad programming practice. It is a holdover from the old days of GWBasic with its line numbers and lack of proper control structures.

Using goto creates code that is hard to follow and debug and lacks logical structure - so called spaghetti code.


That said, goto works like this


goto a
 
a:

Print &quot;Hello World&quot;

b:

Print &quot;Hello Wicked World&quot;


The output of this will be BOTH print statements because goto simply branches to the defined label and then continues to the end of the sub/function.

Change the goto to 'goto b&quot; and only the second statement prints.



This example will not work in Gambas, but it wasn't meant to, I just wrote this to help you understand what I mean.
I think all Gambas tutorials should start with very simple examples and work their way up to advance examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===ATI Radeon Slowdown Problems===

Go the ATI site driver downloads section and select the appropriate OS/graphic card. This will (most likely) link you to the d/l for the current Catalyst 4.4 drivers.

At the bottom of that page is a link to &quot;Previous driver versions&quot;.

D/L the Catalyst 3.7 driver package. Run the EXE and it will extract the driver install package to:

C:\ATI\SUPPORT\

In this directory will be a directory named (for XP/Win2K users:
\wxp-w2k-7-93-030812a1-010735c-efg\

This is where the driver install package is located.
DO NOT RUN THE SETUP. You don't need to install the old driver.

Navigate down thru the dir structure to the following dir:
C:\ATI\SUPPORT\wxp-w2k-7-93-030812a1-010735c-efg\2KXP_INF\B_10679

In this dir you'll find a file called:
atioglxx.dl_
This is a &quot;packed&quot; version of the ATI OGL driver.

The next step specifies how you can extract these files to your hard
disk using the 'expand.exe' utility included on the cd.

The 'I386' folder on the Windows XP CD contains a utility
'expand.exe' that can be used to uncompress all compressed dll files.
It is a commandline utility, so you have will have to run it from
either the command prompt or the Run dialog. Some examples of
its usage are:
            expand X:\I386\ADROT.DL_ C:\ADROT.DLL
            The above command decompresses the compressed DLL
ADROT.DL_ on the WinXP CD, copies it to C:, and changes the extension
to .DLL .

Just extract that file (atioglxx.dll) to your Blender install directory.
Usually C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\

Launch Blender....
no more slowdown.

Addendum: I found this solved a problem of crashing on start up after updating my Catalyst driver from 7.2 to 7.8, that is expanding the old 7.2 atioglxx.dl_ to atioglxx.dll and copying it to the Blender directory.

===For people who the above solution leads to Blender crash at start up===
:Thanks to Xenobius at Blenderartists Forum


This solution is tested on ATI radeon express 200 (x200) integrated video card. However it should
work on other ATI card.

Download the Nvidia 53.03 Driver [http://www.megagames.com/news/redir.cgi?http://download.nvidia.com/Windows/53.03/53.03_winxp2k_english_whql.exe HERE]

Extract the driver to C:\NVIDIA

Copy the nvoglnt.dll from the C:\NVIDIA folder to your blender program folder (i.e. C:\Programs Files\Blender 2.40\)

Rename nvoglnt.dll (the one in the blender program folder) to atioglxx.dll

Run blender...voilà!  Blender runs like it should!


[This works, because it can't use proper gl calls and uses no hardware acceleration so speed goes crappy...]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:XrayRicketsLegssmall.jpg|frame|right|X-ray of the legs in a two-year-old child with rickets]]
'''Rickets''' is a disorder of infancy and early childhood of multiple etiologies. Rickets, causing soft [[bones]], may occur if enough [[Wikipedia:vitamin D|vitamin D]] is not present to assist in [[Wikipedia:calcium|calcium]] absorption. When enough calcium is not absorbed by the bone, it does not harden properly, and is too soft to support the weight of the growing body properly. The disease of rickets takes its name from the Greek word for spine, ''rhakhis''.

== Etiology == 

[[Wikipedia:Vitamin D|Vitamin D]] is made by the body when it is exposed to [[Wikipedia:ultraviolet light|ultraviolet light]] (which is found in sunlight). [[Wikipedia:Vitamin D|Vitamin D]] is also added to [[milk]], milk products, and multi-vitamin pills through a process originally [[Wikipedia:patent|patent]]ed by [[Wikipedia:Harry Steenbock|Harry Steenbock]].  Some people who do not get enough sun exposure, milk products, or green vegetables may also develop the disease. Deficiency of calcium can also cause rickets, particularly in some developing countries where the intake of calcium-rich products such as leafy greens, nuts, and seeds is low.

Hereditary rickets, is caused by an inherited disease that interferes with the resorption of renal tubular phosphate in the [[Wikipedia:kidney|kidney]]. Rickets can also be caused by certain [[Wikipedia:liver|liver]] diseases.

A similar disorder can occur in adults, and is called [[Wikipedia:osteomalacia|osteomalacia]]. Then, it is caused by the inability of bone cells to calcify, or harden. Less frequently, nutritional shortage of calcium or phosphorus may produce rickets.

== Manifestations of disease ==

Rickets causes bone pain, slowed growth in children, [[Wikipedia:dental|dental]] problems, [[muscle]] loss and increased risk of [[Wikipedia:fracture|fracture]]s (easily broken bones). Medical problems seen in children with rickets are

#Vitamin D deficiency,
#Skeletal deformity,
#Growth disturbance,
#Hypocalcemia (low level of calcium in the blood),
#Tetany (uncontrolled muscle spasms).

The [[Wikipedia:X-ray|X-ray]], or [[Wikipedia:radiograph|radiograph]], in the article is the classic image of advanced rickets sufferers: bow legs (outward curve of long bone of the legs) and a deformed chest. Changes in the skull also occur causing a distinctive &quot;square headed&quot; appearance. These deformities persist into adult life.

== Treatment and prevention == 
Treatment involves increasing dietary intake of calcium, [[phosphate]]s and Vitamin D. Exposure to sunshine, [[Wikipedia:cod liver oil|cod liver oil]], halibut-liver oil, and viosterol are all sources of vitamin D.

A sufficient amount of sunlight each day and adequate supplies of calcium and phosphorus in the diet can prevent rickets. Darker-skinned babies need to be exposed longer to the ultraviolet rays.  The replacement of Vitamin D may correct rickets using these methods of ultraviolet light and medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is a &quot;short end&quot;?==

A &quot;short end&quot; is a can of unexposed filmstock that low-budget filmmakers can use as free filmstock.

==Why do they exist?==

Well, consider any typical film shoot.  They will load the camera with filmstock and shoot.  If they finish the day before finishing the film loaded in the camera then they'll split the film loaded in the camera: the exposed footage will go off to their lab for developing whilst the unexposed footage will go into a can to be used at a future date.

==But why doesn't the production company in question re-use the short end?==

Because they won't get negative insurance (insurance which will pay for a re-shoot if the negative film turns out to be duff).

==Oh, and what's a &quot;re-can&quot;?==

A re-can is filmstock that has been loaded into a magazine but never used in the camera.  Re-cans contain as much filmstock as a new can would (i.e. either 400 or 1000 foot).

==Great, how do I get short ends?==

Spend a day on the phone calling up your local production companies.  If you want to be clever then find try to find companies which only shoot on film.  Say &quot;Hi, my name's blah and I'm producing a low budget film.  I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you happened to have any 16mm short ends kicking about?&quot;  Most will say &quot;no&quot;.  One or two will say &quot;um, what's a short end?&quot;.  And about 1 in 100 will say &quot;sure, come over later&quot;.

Make sure you're very polite and thankful.  Make sure you credit the people who helped you out.

When you go to collect the short ends, take a big bag and a friend.  You don't want to have to turn down any short ends just because you can't carry enough.

==Where do I find lists of hundreds of production companies?==

===UK===
* http://www.kftv.com/product-4410.html
* http://www.theknowledgeonline.com/
* http://www.4rfv.co.uk/

==How to I test my short ends?==

You do a dip test at a developing lab.  They will take a few foot from each can and test it.  About half your cans will probably fail.  Don't chuck this stock away though - it's useful for learning to load a camera.

Logicians describe various formal systems of logic which are intended to match a precise but limited range of reasoning.  Each such system defines a formal language.  A scope of such a system&amp;mdash;and the corresponding expressability of its formal language&amp;mdash;matches the range of reasoning it is supposed to describe.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Pyro. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Pyro~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

= Setup and Installation =
Since PHP is a server-side technology, you should naturally expect to invest some time in setting up a server environment for production, development or learning. To be frank, PHP is quite easy to set up compared to other monsters like J2EE. Nevertheless, the procedures are complicated by the various combinations of different versions of web server, PHP and database (most often MySQL). Below I will introduce the steps needed to set up a working PHP environment with MySQL database.

== Linux ==

If your desktop runs on Linux, chances are that Apache, PHP, and MySQL are already installed for you. This wildly popular configuration is commonly referred to as LAMP, i.e. '''L'''inux '''A'''pache '''M'''ySQL '''P'''HP, or '''P''', the latter 'P', can also refer to '''P'''erl another major player in the opensource web service arena. If some components are not installed, you will likely have to manually install the following packages:

* Apache or Lighttpd
* PHP
* MySQL or Postgres
* The PHP integration plugin for the database.

=== Debian or its derivatives ===
On Debian or its derivatives, Ubuntu included{{ref|Ubuntu}}, you can use the corresponding commands:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
apt-get install php5

## Server
#### If you wish to use Apache
apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5
a2enmod php5
service apache2 restart
## -or-
#### If you wish to use Lighttpd
apt-get install lighttpd php5-cgi
lighttpd-enable-mod fastcgi fastcgi-php
service lighttpd restart

## Database
#### If you wish to use Postgres
apt-get install postgres-server    postgres-client    php5-pg
## -or-
#### If you wish to use Mysql
apt-get install mysql-server       mysql-client       php5-mysql
&lt;/source&gt;

{{note|Ubuntu}} If you chose to use Ubuntu with Apache and MySQL you might wish to utilize the Ubuntu community site for such a configuration [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP ubuntu lamp wiki].

=== Gentoo ===
For Gentoo Linux users, the gentoo-wiki has this HowTo available: [http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Apache2_with_PHP_MySQL Apache2 with PHP and MySQL].

In general, you'll want to do the following under Gentoo:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
emerge apache
emerge mysql
emerge mod_php
&lt;/source&gt;

=== RPM-based ===
The exact procedures depend on your Linux distribution. On a Fedora system, the commands are typically as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
yum install httpd
yum install php
yum install mysql
yum install php-mysql
&lt;/source&gt;

It's impossible to cover all the variants here, so consult your Linux distribution's manual for more details, or grab a friend to do it for you.

One sure-fire way of getting PHP up and running on your *nix system is to compile it from source. This isn't as hard as it may sound and there are good instructions available in the [http://au.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.php PHP manual].

== Windows ==

PHP on Windows is also a very popular option. On a Windows platform, you have the option to use either the open source [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] web server, or the native Internet Information Services (IIS) server from Microsoft, which can be installed from your Windows CD. When you have one of these servers installed, you can download and install the appropriate PHP Windows binaries distributions from [http://www.php.net/downloads.php PHP download page]. The installer version requires less user-interaction.

For increased performance you will want to use FastCGI. There is a wikibook that will assist you on [[IIS and FastCGI|Setting up IIS with FastCGI]].

=== Databases ===
On Microsoft Windows you must always install your own database. Two popular choices are the open source Postgres, and MySQL. Postgres is more liberally licensed, and is free to use for commercial purposes. 

==== Postgresql ====

Official Zend documentation: [http://us.php.net/pgsql http://us.php.net/pgsql]

Postgres is simple and easy to install, browse to [http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/binary/v8.3.0/win32/ http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/binary/v8.3.0/win32/] and download the exe and double-click.

==== MySQL ====

Official MySQL documentation: [http://us.php.net/mysql http://us.php.net/mysql]

You might wish to install the MySQL database. You can download the Windows version of [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ MySQL], and follow the installation instructions. If you have PHP 4, you do not need to install the equivalence of php-mysql on Linux, as MySQL support is built-in in Windows distributions of PHP. In PHP 5 you will need to uncomment the following line in your php.ini file (that is, remove the ';' at the beginning of the line):

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
  ;extension=php_mysql.dll
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Bundled Package ===

If you find all the above too much a hassle, you have another option. Driven by the eternal desire to do things the safe/easy way, several conveniently packaged AMP bundles of Apache/MySQL/PHP can be found on the net. One of them is [http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptriad/ PHPTriad]. Or, you can try [http://www.uniformserver.com Uniform Server]. It is a small [[WAMP]] Package. (The acronym ''WAMP'' refers to a server stack where Microsoft Windows is the operating system, Apache is the Web server, MySQL handles the database components, and PHP, Python, or PERL represents the dynamic scripting languages). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/WAMP.html&lt;/ref&gt; Uniformserver is packaged as a self-extracting zip archive, and is easy to use. After trying it out you can simply delete the directory and everything is clean.
[http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html XAMPP for Windows] is another WAMP server that is easy to use. In addition, is has an installation option that allows you to install it on a computer if you have administration rights. XAMPP has options to run PERL and JAVA (on a tomcat server). A number of other portable Windows AMP package choices are summarized at [http://www.portablefreeware.com/?sc=125 List of portable Web Servers].

Also, a package installer called '''WAMPserver''' is available. It simply installs Apache, PHP and MySQL on windows with ease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wampserver.com/en/ Wamp server]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Easy Windows Setup Instructions ===

1) PHP authoring environment
* Any text editor will do, but I recommend one with syntax coloring especially for someone new to coding or PHP. Notepad++ is my favorite so far with its ease of use, customizability and the ability to collapse tags. All editor help will be in reference to Notepad++
* Install Notepad++. Download the binary file from here: http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm

2) PHP running environment
* Now that you have the ability to create and save PHP files you need an environment that can process them and generate the output that your browser displays. There are two ways to accomplish this.
# Get a web host that supports PHP and upload your files every time you make a change.
# Use your own computer as a personal server with PHP support, and only upload final versions to a web host.
* Accomplishing 2. above is actually easier than you think (assuming you are running Windows).
# Download The uniform server. Here is the link to the latest version: http://sourceforge.net/projects/miniserver/files/
# Run the self-extracter UniServerX_Y_Z.exe. Copy the directory to your &quot;C:&quot; drive so the full path is &quot;C:\UniServer&quot;.
# In the directory where you had it extract hit the &quot;Start.exe&quot; file to get the server running
# Place any files and subfolders you want the server to read and process in the &quot;www&quot; folder.
# Your web browser should open to &quot;http://localhost/index.php&quot;
* Now you have the resources to effectively edit PHP documents and process them on your own computer.
* Here is how to create a test page
# Inside &quot;C:\UniServer\www\&quot;, create a webpage called &quot;test.php&quot;
# Edit &quot;test.php&quot; with Notepad++, and copy the following

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;charset=utf-8&quot; /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Test Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;Description&quot; content=&quot;Test Page&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;Keywords&quot; content=&quot;Test,Page&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;?php
  $string = 'Hello world! &lt;br/&gt;';
  echo $string;
  
  print $string;
  
  printf('%s', $string);  
?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

# Save the webpage as &quot;C:\UniServer\www\test.php&quot;
# Open &quot;http://localhost/test.php&quot; in your web browser to view the page. You should see:
Hello world!&lt;br/&gt;
Hello world!&lt;br/&gt;
Hello world!&lt;br/&gt;
# (Optional: Follow these instructions for how to make PHP code work with webpages that end in &quot;.html&quot; in addition to &quot;.php&quot;: [http://www.desilva.biz/php/phpinhtml.html http://www.desilva.biz/php/phpinhtml.html])

== Mac OS X ==

Mac OS X comes with Apache server as standard, and enabling it is as simple as checking the box next to 'Personal Web Sharing' in the 'Sharing' section of System Preferences. Once you have done this you can place files in /Library/WebServer/Documents to access them on your server. Mac OS X does come with PHP but the installation lacks any significant quantity of extensions, so if you want any you're going to have to install PHP yourself. You can do this by following the instructions in Apple's [http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/php.html Developer Connection], or you can download an automatic installer such as the ones available at [http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/ Entropy]. Once you've done one of those, you'll have a server with PHP running on your Mac.

To install MySQL just download and run the [http://www.serverlogistics.com/mysql.php OS X installer package] or use [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html XAMPP for MacOS X].

If you use unix or learning it, however, compiling might be the way to go for all three, or just the ones you like. The advantage is that you can choose exactly that extensions you want for PHP and Apache. Also you can choose which versions to compile together. To do this make sure you have the Developer Tools installed. They are shipped with OS X.

= How Do I Know My Setup is Working? =

After you have successfully completed the previous section, it's time to make sure that everything went well. You also get the chance to write your very first PHP scripts! Open your favourite ''plain'' [[w:text editor|text editor]] (''not'' Microsoft Word or another [[wikipedia:word processor|word processor]]), and type the following magical line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Save it as phpinfo.php in your web server's root document directory. If you are using a web hosting server, upload it to the server to where you would place HTML files. Now, open up your web browser, and go to &lt;nowiki&gt;http://localhost/phpinfo.php&lt;/nowiki&gt;, or &lt;nowiki&gt;http://your-web-hosting-server.com/phpinfo.php&lt;/nowiki&gt; if you are using a web hosting server, and look at the output.

Now scroll down that page and make sure there is a table with the title &quot;mysql&quot;, and the top row should read: &quot;MySQL support: enabled&quot;. If your output does not have this, your particular installation of PHP does not have MySQL support enabled. Note that this test doesn't tell you whether MySQL server is running. You should fire up your MySQL client and check before you proceed.

Some dedicated php or script editors even have color coding of different words that can be very useful for finding mistakes. A free implementation of this is the powerful Notepad++, available from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus Sourceforge] and licensed under the GPL.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Denni. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Denni~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

The main portion of Statistics is the display of summarized data.  Data is initially collected from a given source, whether they are experiments, surveys, or observation, and is presented in one of four methods:

; Textular Method : (Don`t base with this info, it`s hoax!) the gathered data.
; Tabular Method : Provides a more precise, systematic and orderly presentation of data in rows or columns.
; Semi-tabular Method : Uses both textual and tabular methods.
; Graphical Method : The utilization of graphs is most effective method of visually presenting statistical results or findings.

The previous chapters dealt with DC. This chapter gives a brief introduction to AC or Alternating Current. Although most people associate AC with the 120V or 230V outlets, it also involves any other electric signal which change polarity periodically e.g. audio signals.&lt;BR&gt;
This chapter will address a small subset of AC signals: single phase AC as it's produced by the electricity company and delivered through the outlets in your home. 

'''A note on safety:''' This chapter doesn't contain experiments. There are 2 reasons for this. First any interesting experiments would require the use of an oscilloscope. Secondly, experimenting with electricity from an outlet is dangerous in so many ways: Death through electrocution, 3rd degree burns from electricity, house fire after a short circuit,... Schools have special infrastructure to be able to do such experiments in relative safety. Most of them would use a variable AC power supply rather than AC outlets anyway. 

=== What is AC? ===
[[File:Ac basic.png|center|thumb|250px|AC]]

This image shows a typical AC signal. How this signal changes over time is shown. If you've had trigonometry you'll notice the typical shape of the sinus function. 

[[File:Ac param.png|center|thumb|250px|AC with period and amplitude]]


This image shows the '''amplitude''' of the AC signal, denoted as '''Um'''. This is the highest value the signal reaches.

If you look at the 2 lines marked with the T, you'll see they connect 2 identical points on the sine curve. The time it takes to get from the first to the second point is called the '''period''' and is indicated with the symbol '''T'''. This is a time and therefore expressed in seconds (or more likely milliseconds ms).

'''Frequency''' is the inverse of the period: f = 1 / T and is expressed in Hertz (Hz). It's defined as the number of periods per second.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''1. Aim of book:''' To make it possible for people to read this and start creating their own electronic devices and understanding them. Introducing theories only when they apply to what the reader is doing (follow the Keep It Short and Simple rule).

Although the [[Electronics]] wikibook has about the same goal, it introduces too many 
theories that don't apply to beginners and no hands-on experience, making it impossible to learn out of that book. Links to some theories in that book may be added so they are not replicated on both books, unless it needs to be shortened.

'''2. Prerequisites:''' Some knowledge of physics and math is assumed

'''3. Materials:''' You may want to consider getting the following materials: [[w:Breadboard|Breadboard]], and a source of voltage to start with. (under construction)
=Sources of [[Electronics/DC Voltage and Current|Direct current (DC)]] Voltage=

*For simple hands-on experiences to learn about Electronics it is best to start with [[Electronics/Batteries|'''BATTERIES''']] as a simple source of electricity. All sorts of types of batteries are available, and it is important to select the correct type for the particular usage.
** AN EXAMPLE:
I have 2 sets of 3-volt (two 1.5 volt each in series) D-size batteries, one new, call it black, and the other used, call it red. The open-circuit actual measured voltages are approximately Red=2.75 Volt, Black=2.97 Volt. Each of these sets of batteries has an internal resistance which can be calculated as follows:

..... Use a load resistance, but which? My ammeter has a range with a full-scale deflection of 0.5 Amperes, which I could get by using a resistor having about 3/0.5 = 6 Ohms (6 Ω). But I do not have such a resistor.

..... Using a 25 Ω resistor as a load, I get a current flow of 95 milliamperes (mA) from the black batteries. Calculating the total approximate resistance in circuit (internal plus external) 2.97/0.097=31.3 Ohms (total). Deduct the external 25 Ω, and get approximately 6 Ω for the internal resistance of the black battery set.

..... Using the same 25 Ω external resistor, I get a current flow of only 60 mA from the red batteries, which indicates an approximate internal resistance of (2.75/0.060) - 25 = 46 - 25 = 21 Ω.

*Another simple source of DC is a [[w:Battery charger|'''BATTERY CHARGER''']]. This gets its energy from one of the sockets usually available at the bottom in every room. A battery charger starts off with Alternating Current (AC) derived from the mains/line via that socket, and, using one or more [[Electronics/Rectifier|rectifiers]], converts it into Direct Current (DC) whose voltage keeps changing very quickly all the time from zero to maximum and back again. Often a [[Electronics/Capacitors|Capacitor]], also sometimes called a Condenser, is used to &quot;smooth&quot; the available DC voltage, and the resulting DC. It is connected across the DC voltage source.
**&lt;U&gt;An example&lt;/U&gt; of a [[w:Battery charger|battery charger]] with 3 different output circuits described on the label:

== Introduction ==

This wikibook is about the development of historical writing. 

=== Prolegomena ===

There are many ways in which such a history could be organized for individuals. For example, we could organize
the narrative spatially, discussing the historians of the individual countries. Or we could
identify the principal forms of historical writing, such as the chronicle, the annal, the
monumental inscription, the monograph, the treatise, the legend, the biography and its cousins, 
and so on and so forth. Or we could enumerate the different forms of philosophy of history 
and the conceptions of history, and then exemplify these forms by correlating them with 
their styles and representatives. And these are just a few of the possible approaches.

However, historians have a gentle preference for chronological arrangements, and that
with good reason. For each of the different organizing principles we have just named
&amp;mdash; countries, historical forms of writing, philosophies and conceptions of history &amp;mdash; 
are themselves historical. Countries change; their boundaries move; their territories are
renamed; their rivers change their courses or stop running altogether. Equally literary forms:
they are invented, they undergo development, they fall out of fashion, they get rediscovered. 
The process for philosophies of history is not dissimilar.

The intention is now clear: Organizing a historical narrative along forms that are themselves
historical complicates the matter considerably. It is therefore appealing to use time, that is, 
an idealized linear chronological sequence of time, as a common reference system, in which all 
the changes of the other principles can be put into relation to each other and described. 

Unfortunately, a chronological sequence is merely a start. Most of what historians work 
with beyond just time is itself historical. This is especially  true for many of the 
words with which historians write and for many of the concepts that  historians use. 
At the same time, we would prefer not to be restricted to those words that
the historians of a particular time knew or employed. 

The method historians employ to get around this apparent contradiction of wanting to
use the concepts and words of their subject matter but also use the conceptual tools since then
developed is to use the [[wikipedia:Hermeneutics|hermeneutical circle]]. 
Basically, the hermeneutical circle says that as one studies and re-studies evidence from 
the past, one comes to a deeper understanding of its meaning by realizing the assumption 
the reader made and the assumptions that the author made, and reflecting them explicitly.

Finally, we must briefly think about the problem of historical interest. Almost
any event of significant size is so rich in detail that one could not enumerate
the detail completely. At the same time, not every little detail is in fact &quot;relevant&quot;
in all situations. That is why in historical writing we find &quot;historical interest&quot; 
at work, namely the observation that the authors of historical
texts will choose from the multitude of details those details that they consider 
relevant to the stories that they want to tell. 

The problem is that people can and will disagree on what the important details
of an event are. In addition, rhetorical devices such as the &quot;lie of omission&quot; 
indicate that manipulating the amount of information can seriously distort the 
impression that one gets of an event. At the same time, historical interest is
itself historical and influenced by socio-political conventions. 

Thus, with the above said in mind, we will attempt a chronological reconstruction of 
the history of historical writing. The following briefly sketches the contents of the 
individual chapters.

=== Archaic Historians ===

In our modern information society, it may be surprising to learn that historical writing 
was a relative late development. But people who could write were few; and since they were 
writing, others had to provide food and shelter for them. Consequently, it was not until 
the first bureaucratic states, such as [[wikipedia:Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and 
[[wikipedia::Ancient_Egypt|Ancient Egypt]], that the surplus of food and labor was 
sufficient to make historical writing possible.

At the same time, the historians writing for the pharaos, priests and kings of the 
ancient civilizations are rarely known to us by name. There was little interest in their
authorship; the focus of their writing was on the deeds and tribulations of their masters,
states, people or colleagues. Indeed, initially I was tempted to call this chapter not the
archaic, but the anonymous historians, for this seems to be one of their key characteristics. 

Their stylistic repertoire was equally limited. Often, these early historians were primarily 
[[wikipedia::Chronicler|chronicler]] of events, that is, they wrote a form of historical 
writing that simply enumerates the individual events but provides no overarching narrative or
structure.

=== Ancient Historians ===

With the beginning of the 5&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; century BC, 
we begin to encounter the first historians
who are authors in the modern sense of the word, that is, people who are associated with their 
works in the mind of their audience. 

For the Mediterranean world, this means writers like [[wikipedia:Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]], [[wikipedia:Thukydides|Thukydides]], [[wikipedia:Livy|Livy]], [[wikipedia:Plutarch|Plutarch]] 
or [[wikipedia:Flavius Josephus|Flavius Josephus]], to name just a few of the more well-known names.

The majority of the writing that was produced at the beginning of this period was still 
intended for public reading to the audience. The authors might travel from settlement to settlement 
and read from their stories. As the period progressed, the number of people with literary training in 
society increased. As a result, historical writings for a more personal consumption
were produced. Writers like [[wikipedia::Xenophon|Xenophon]] come to mind, who not only wrote books
intended for public, that is, political consumption, such as his [[wikipedia::Anabasis|Anabasis]], 
but also books to be circulated among good friends, such as his 
[[wikipedia::Hellenica (Xenophon)|Hellenica]]. 

The situation is more complicated for the Far East. 
Take China, where during the period of the [[wikipedia:Warring States|Warring States]], 
some form of historiography must have taken place, as the [[wikipedia:Five Classics|Confucian Classics]] 
include both a &lt;I&gt;Book of History&lt;/I&gt; and an [[wikipedia::Annals|annal]], the [[wikipedia:Spring and Autumn Annals|Spring and Autumn Annals]] of the State of Lu. Unfortunately, the authors of these works
remain anonymous, assuming that [[wikipedia:Confucius|Confucius]] primarily functioned as their editor.  
It is not until [[wikipedia:Sima Qian|Sima Qian]]'s [[wikipedia:Shiji|Records of the Great Historian]]
that we can associate a name and a biography with a great Chinese history.

Toward the latter third of this period, we see the rise of Christian [[Church Historiography]], 
a topic that would deserve its own Wikibook.


=== Medieval Historians ===

The state of historical writing in the West changes very drastically with the fragmentation of the 
Roman Empire at the end of the 5th century AD, and the invasion of the Germanic tribes. 
In the western half of the empire, local pockets of both the ability to write and the ability 
to deal with existant sources remain, especially in the larger cities and on the more secure
island of [[wikipedia:Ireland]]. Administrators of the Roman state or the Christian churches, 
such as [[wikipedia:Gregory of Tours|Gregory of Tours]], [[wikipedia:Paul the Deacon|Paulus Diaconus]] or
[[wikipedia:Asser, Bishop of Sherborne|Bishop Asser]] continue to write historical records of their
times, often with heavy theological interpretative agendas. The new potentates of the former
Roman provinces sponsored annals and chronicles, such as 
the [[wikipedia:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Anglo-Saxon Chronicles]], and eventually also [[wikipedia:Biography|vitae]], that is descriptions of their life. Two mid 9th-century examples would be [[wikipedia:Einhard|Einhard's]] &lt;I&gt;Vita Caroli&lt;/I&gt; and [[wikipedia:Notker|Notker's]] &lt;I&gt;De Carolo Magno&lt;/I&gt;.

For the [[wikipedia:Byzantine Empire|former Eastern half of the Roman Empire]], most of the
cultural productivity remains focused in the capital [[wikipedia:Byzanz|Byzanthium]]. The production
of historical writing revolves around the maintenance of existing literature and of writing that
is relevant to the imperial court, e.g. the &lt;I&gt;Alexiad&lt;/I&gt; of [[wikipedia:Anna Commena|Anna Commena]], 
one of the first female historiographers we will encounter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Subvocalization''', or silent speech, is defined as the internal speech made when [[reading (activity)|reading]] a word, thus allowing the reader to imagine the sound of the word as it is read (Carver 1990).  This is a natural process when reading and helps to reduce cognitive load, and helps the mind to access meanings to enable it to comprehend and remember what is read.  

There is no evidence that normal non-observable subvocalizing will negatively effect any reading process (Carver 1990)(McWhorter 2002).  At the more powerful rates (Memorizing, learning, and reading for comprehension) subvocalizing is very detectable by the reader.  At the less powerful faster rates (skimming and scanning), subvocalization is less detectable.  For normal competent readers, subvocalizing to some extent even at scanning rates is normal.  However, [[speed reading]] advocates generally teach lengthy prescriptive practices to eliminate subvocalising when reading as they claim it &quot;places extra burden on the cognitive resources, thus, slowing the reading down.&quot;  Normal reading instructors may simply apply remedial teaching to a reader who subvocalizes to the degree that they make visible movements on the lips, jaw, or throat (McWhorter 2002). 

It may be impossible to totally eliminate subvocalizing because people learn to read by associating the sight of words with their spoken sounds.  Sound associations for words are indelibly imprinted on the nervous systems, even of deaf people, as they will have associated the word with the mechanism for causing the sound.  Subvocalizing is an inherent part of reading and understanding a word, and micro-muscle tests suggest that subvocalizing is impossible to eliminate.  Attempting to stop subvocalizing is potentially harmful to comprehension, learning and memory. At the more powerful reading rates (100-300wpm), subvocalizing can be used to improve comprehension.

This book is quickly turning into a book that you can read but not apply to anything, if you're going to contribute a chapter about a part at least put experiments demonstrating what the part does. --[[User:V2os|V2os]] 15:07, 5 August 2005 (UTC) this is a big problem for the electronics wikibook since once it gets to digital circuits there's no instructions about building a digital circuit.

== This book already exists ==

You will be pleased to know that a substantial book on learning electronics already exists as [[Electronics]]. It would be best if you could merge any new content there. Thanks, ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 11:23, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

:Sorry, I want to do something differnt than that book, as it has no hands on experience, and is full of many theories that don't need to be taught to beginners. There are also no circuits you can make in that book. 04:39, 16 July 2005 [[User:172.146.141.205]]

See [[Wikibooks:Duplicate articles]] policy. I still think that you should, at least, link your book in closely with [[Electronics]]. Your aim appears to be directly compatible with [[Electronics:Aim]], but they simply have not written much of the basic hands on stuff yet, maybe you could help by writing it?

:I've been looking into it but it looks as it would be similar to putting a square peg in a round hole. Too many theories that don't need to be taught, it's just much better and faster to introduce things as the lessons advance and the new components/circuits are introduced. at least half of that stuff doesn't need to be taught until the end of the book, but it's introduced first.--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 04:09, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

Okay, how about linking to the theory in [[Electronics]] whenever you need a theoretical explanation (i.e., instead of duplicating the explanation yourself), and making your book a series of practical tutorials. It's desirable to eliminate duplication within Wikibooks, because it allows electronics contributors to concentrate their efforts. You may want to add some links to the appropriate tutorials within [[LearnElectronics]] to Electronics, so that readers of Electronics can benefit from your efforts too. I'll remove the merge tag for now, but please keep Wikibook's duplication policy in mind while writing. Good luck.

== some critics, positive ones ofcourse ;-) ==

IMO it's a good idea to write an beginners book on electronics. The other one is indeed pretty advanced (and I can know I've got a degree in it :-D ).&lt;BR&gt;
I don't know your background in electronics, but I would suspect you're either self taught or still learning. (writting about it is one of the best the learn it throughfully) The reason I suspect this is the part on Ohms law. You going over it pretty fast and this is the law that has more about it than what most people see. A good explaination requires some text, a little math and a drawing. The drawing is essential as it shows exactly how the voltage drop over a resistor appears. This is essential to comprehend this law completely. Most people don't think this is important.&lt;BR&gt;
An second point on this section is that you make it sound as if Ohms law applies to other components, which is not. Ohm's law only applies to resistors. Diodes, coils and capacitors do not follow this law. (For DC. AC is a differend thing. Capacitors and coild follow an extended version of Ohms law for AC.)

:I am self taught, but will be attending a program at a vocational school (with classes in electronics) to complete my last 2 years of highschool. It has been a while since the last time i was being taught some very basic electronics, I really don't have a complete knowledge of this so I need people to fix errors like that of the Ohm's law section you mention, and help in writting the book. I'm just trying to set up a structure to the book, each chapter a new concept/part/equation is introduced and explained is what i'm trying for(except for the first few so you can start doing hands on stuff fast).

::I'll try to contribute as time permits. (I'm already contributing to 3 wikibooks, 2 of which I started myself). --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 09:13, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

== layout/content ideas ==

Seems you intent to seperate the theory and practice in different chapters. How about linking them closer? e.g. Explain the resistor, then follow with some hands-on experiment demonstrating Ohm's Law in practice, followed by some explaination why the measured values aren't exactly the same as those calculated. IMO small portions of theory followed by small experiments are a very good way to learn this material and it's easy to expand the book this way. &lt;BR&gt;
Also you should cleary note that this is about DC. AC differs very much from DC and IMO should be something like part 2 of the book. &lt;BR&gt;
Ohm's law is very easy to turn in a intresting demo, without expensive equipment. Kirchof's laws are harder to demo (the law about the currents in and out a node would need at least 3 current measurements, idealy at the same time).

:Don't remember any of that, and i don't have any measuring equipment, or know how to use it, it would be nice if you could contribute something about this or find an article about it online and send a link (both how to use the equipment and the ohm's law demo).--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 03:39, 18 July 2005 (UTC)



== Some content suggestions ==

I've had some experience with teaching electronics, but not at this level. The way the book is currently organised requires the reader to learn all of the theory before doing the hands on stuff. Maybe it would be better it interleave the two more closely.

[[User:Geocachernemesis:LearnElectronics/Tmp contents|See my bulky proposed changes to the contents here.]]

You get the idea... ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 06:43, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

:I like it. (makes me realize how little i actualy know about electronics at the moment.)--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 16:23, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

I've started to organize the book like this.--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 20:38, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

== AC measurements ==

AC is a bit/lot harder than DC. Perhaps we should spend a chapter to it, before moving on to the active components? IMO it's more trouble to split up the AC and DC characteristics of e.g. a transistor than it is to introduce AC first and then explain the transistor. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 08:33, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

:As far as I can see, AC measurements are way beyond the scope of the book. Also, they would be very difficult to arrange without the aid of a signal generator and an oscilloscope. Yes, we could build a variable oscillator, feed it into the circuit under test, then use a small capacitor to store the peak voltage after rectification (that could be used to measure the peak voltage at several points with the aid of a multimeter). I think that anything more than a multimeter is a bit much to ask from any beginner.

:I know that most tertiary courses in electronics simultaneously cover both the AC and DC characteristics of some passive and active components. But, I think that we can do them separately (with the AC characteristics far later, if we do them at all). With only DC (or very slowly changing voltages to measure), the BJT can be seen as a switch or current amplifier, the FET as a switch, the diode allows current to flow in only one direction, and the LED lights up with cool colours. Maybe we could get away with doing a simple oscillator with flashing LEDs, flashing at about 0.5 Hz, but that's about as AC as we can easily get. On the other hand, it would be great if we could do some tutorials for some of the advanced stuff in the [[Electronics]] book, that would bring the two books together nicely. But, this book is currently aimed at the very beginner.

== New title? ==

I've just been quickly looking at the basic material in the [[Electronics]] book. I think that we really need to limit the scope of this book so that it accomodates only the very beginner (i.e., people who don't know anything about electronics). Also, the title may be better changed to [[Beginning electronics]] (or at least [[Learning electronics]], to fit with our naming conventions)? Tell me what you think, and I'll move the pages to the new name. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 05:25, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
:That may be a good idea. Perhaps we should keep this book as a page to link to all the electronics books at differend levels. Perhaps a second book covering the harder parts can be written too later and then a link to it can be added here? --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 08:46, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, we could link to it at the beginning of the Electronics book to get people up to speed for the Basic electronics section. I suppose they could run in parallel to some extent though, but using a naive treatment of electronics that doesn't rely on describing what happens to electrons and other theory (I assume that's what [[User:V2os|V2os]] had in mind for this book). But, is it really electronics, or only electricity and magnetism? ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 11:25, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
:This is probably going to be limited to basic electricity and (simple) digital electronics. The hardest subject would probably be the RC circuit. I would avoid magnetism as it's pretty complicated. I would save it for the more advanced book, possible together with AC. Probably we should cover resistors (ohm's Law, That other law to calculate the resistance of a wire), Kirchof, capacitors in DC and the RC circuit. For real electronics I'd say we could cover Boolean logic (easy to test on a bread board) and perhaps a bit on the specs of TTL and CMOS (measuring when the input on a logic gate switches from 0 to 1, that sort of stuff). I don't think I'll have to mention the &quot;what is electricity/voltage/current&quot; part as this is pretty straight forward that we start with such a chapter. For the math and theory: how about we'll add some of that as optional chapters? Either as a new (small) chapter outside the table of content (or how I'm supposed to call it) or as a link to the other electronics books?&lt;BR&gt; Transistors can be covert as a switch, but it's hard to come up with a good introduction without using AC, also experiments would require an oscilloscope to be practical. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 15:09, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

All great suggestions Patrik, I think you have summed it up nicely. We'll see what V2os thinks when they get back. If only I'd spent as much time writing the book as discussing it, we may have already had part of a chapter. Unfortunately, I'm currently too busy to devote much time to it, but I'll help out where I can.

:I've put together a ruf TOC with some explaination. I'll add it [[Learn Electronics/Appendix|here]] otherwise this page becomes pretty cluttered. I'll wait to see what V2os has to say about it, before writing anything real. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 11:48, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

I'll be interested to see what you come up with Patrik. V2os' comments earlier seem a bit vague, and they ''don't have any measuring equipment, or know how to use it''. So, that would limit our experiments a bit. But, I think we need to explain how to use a multimeter, otherwise we are limited to flashing (or static) lights for feedback. Maybe it would also be better to substitute LEDs (with roughly appropriate current limiting resistors) for the light bulbs, that would be far cheaper, and we could use the breadboard and a 9 V battery to run it (of course the LEDs would only work in one orientation, but the reason why could be explained far later, along with the reason for using the resistor in series). 12:03, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

I've just looked at your TOC, and it looks good to me. Maybe we should spend even more time at the bottom end though. It may be better to keep the entire book on one page to begin with, so your TOC could be expanded as it is.

:More chapters on digital electronics? That part is going to be the most intresting part anyway. I guess Part one can be kept short and to the point (with most of it being fun experiments) and we can be more elaborate on the second part. V2os intended to use a lot of hands-on stuff, so we could use the experiments to introduce the theory. (boolean algebra in theory is pretty boring, but if we use a few experiments to demonstrate the methodes of boolean algebra, it'll be more intresting.)&lt;BR&gt;
''I guess V2os is going to have a lot to read when he comes back ;-)''
--[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 12:45, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, I hope we haven't got totally the wrong end of the stick. Hopefully this book doesn't step on [[Electronics]] toes too much, it would be a shame to have to merge (but, we could also call this book [[Electronics:Beginning electronics]]).

:Don't think the auhors of [[Electronics]] are going to have any problems with this wikibook. IMO [[Electronics]] is aimed at a college level, while this one would be aimed at highschool level. Our prerequisits aren't very extensive. The picture I've got of the content would require some knowledge of basic algebra, but little else more as we don't cover any AC related content and so avoid trigonometry, vectors, complex numbers and any more complicated functions. The hardest part would be drawing the function of a RC circuit and boolean algebra is pretty stand alone.&lt;BR&gt; If/when we would start a simular book/part on AC then we'll going to need a bit more math, however this is still going to be limited to simple functions ( u = U * sin (omega * t + phi) would suffice for explaining much of AC), but we'll deal with that after this book is well on its way to completion.--[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 15:29, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

'''Do not want to limit scope of book.''' I will be getting hands on stuff done starting in chapter 2.(sorry for leave of absence) I do want this book to go somewhat far (at least into remote control), and be aimed at high school students. I will be getting measuring equipment. if it were to go as far as all of you are suggesting it wouldn't be better than the books at my library. (the transistor is new in them!) give me some time to read this stuff over some more.--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 00:48, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

I want this to sort of mirror what i'm going to be learning in school, and the classes that promise that you'll be able to create videogame consoles by the end of the class. (I realize I'm not going to be able to contribute too much more to this book since i don't know much about the subject.)--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 16:33, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

If you provide some sort of table of contents, we'll be able to fill in the parts you aren't familiar with. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 13:00, 23 July 2005 (UTC)

On Geocachernemesis proposed changes i don't know much (maybe anything) about 4,6,7, and 8. To be clear on the AC thing, yes I think we should be doing stuff with AC. (Also I can't find what TOC means and it's mentioned here a lot. could someone tell me what it means?)

:Patrik and I thought that AC (e.g., audio signals, and not just mains) measurements would be too difficult, because they would require the use of an signal generator and an oscilloscope, and we felt that they would be far too expensive for beginners. Even so, there is plenty that can be done with only a multimeter. TOC means table of contents, and I actually prefer Patrik's to mine in some ways. I've also had second thoughts about the use of light bulbs and sockets in the experiments, because they are quite expensive. If we need a breadboard anyway, then why not use LEDs instead, they would be far cheaper?

:Also, we should consider changing the title of the book (as mentioned above), and keeping the book on one page until it grows a bit more (i.e., limit the number of pages created).

If you want to cover AC, it'll be much more theoretical. I've got course notes from a 4th year electricity (compares to high school) which covers basic AC in a quite simple way. It limits to single fase AC and simple AC circuits. (I also have college notes which cover it much more in depth, but those would be way too math-intensive). I've done a few experiments without an oscilloscope or signal generator in those classes, but these all came down to measuring voltage and/or current at particular intervals or in some special way. e.g. measuring input and output voltage/current of a transformer as to demonstrate that the product U*I remains constant in both coils. Or measuring the current in a circuit with a lightbulb to demonstrate the temperature dependent resistance of its filament (the wire inside of it).&lt;BR&gt;But when it comes down to demonstrating frequency effects or phase, you'll need a oscilloscope.&lt;BR&gt;Another thing you should keep in mind is safety. These experiments I mentioned use mains power which is dangerous. Especialy to people trying to do an experiment. You could say to use a transformer to make it safer, but not all transformers are really save, there is a variety which doesn't have 2 magnetic coupled coils, but use an AC voltage divider, these devices are cheap and dangerous for use in experiments.&lt;BR&gt;
To summerize the issues with AC:&lt;BR&gt;
*Expensive equipment. (oscilloscope, signal generator)
*Risk of using main power.
*large amount of theory without really room for experiments in between.&lt;BR&gt;
--[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 12:32, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

I would like some very basic AC stuff, at least explain what AC means, and simulation of it, i think it probably should all be on one page for a while until it gets bigger. I agree with replacing the light bulb and socket with LEDs.--[[User:V2os|V2os]] 05:00, 31 July 2005 (UTC)

The basic AC is pretty easy. I can fill it in later this week (as time permits). If you could provide a link to where I should place it. I personaly would place it at the end of the current TOC, something like &quot;what is AC&quot;, followed by &quot;simple AC circuits with resistors, capacitors and inductors&quot; and then something on transformers, but not very theoretical, more practical oriented material. It's common to teach magnetisme along with AC, but IMO it would be way too theoretical for this book. The final version would contain a lot of graphics, but that isn't going to be in the first edits. Unless I can borrow some from other free sources I'll have to draw them myself or have other contributers draw them. But we'll deal with that when we get there. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 13:57, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

I probably can contribute for very young beginners, even making it much too simple(?) on purpose. But it may duplicate some items somewhere else. I'm not going to search for any duplications with other articles, and leave that up to other editors, also to merge with other articles. Also, I don't yet know how to do diagrams, nor mathematical formulae - please feel free to add these to my contributions. Thanks.

'''Electronics''' use [[Basic Electrical Generation and Distribution|electric power]].
* A [[Electronics/Batteries|battery]] is a source of electric power.
* A wall socket is a source of a different kind of electric power.
* [[GCSE Science/Advanced static electricity topics|Lightning]] is also a (very dangerous) source of electric power.
* [[GCSE Science/Advanced static electricity topics|Sparks]] while combing some people's hair is called &quot;[[GCSE Science/Static Electricity|Static electricity]]&quot;. Also some rugs can cause static electricity.

===Voltage and Current===

Electronic equipment operates by controlling the flow of electrons. Electrons are part of the atom. The atom also contains neutrons and protons. The number of protons and electrons in an atom are usually equal, but if it is not the atom is called an ion.&lt;ref&gt;If the atom is missing electrons it is said to be positive (cation); if it has extra electrons it is said to be negative (anion). 
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric current''' is the flow of '''charge''' from one place to another, reminiscent of the way ocean current is the flow of water from one place to another. Charge is like a tiny indivisible packet of electricity, and is carried by electrons. The charge on each electron is fixed, but if more electrons flow in a given time, then more charge is said to be flowing. An electron is a type of '''charge carrier''' - it carries charge, but it is not the only type. Later we will introduce another kind of charge carrier used in all electronics, so while we talk about electrons as the entity that carries charge, keep in mind that the term &quot;charge carrier&quot; is sometimes more appropriate.

Charge is important when we examine semiconductors, which is what real electronics is all about. Charges of the same sign (- and -, or + and +) '''repel''' each other, just as like poles of a magnet do. Conversely, unlike charges (+ and -) '''attract''' each other. This fact is very important. It is this attraction and repulsion of charge that causes charge to move in a conductor, thus creating a current.

Charge flows when there is a difference of '''potential''' between two points in the '''circuit'''. '''Potential difference''' is measured in '''volts''' and is sometimes called '''voltage'''. The larger the potential difference, the larger the flow of charge, all else being equal. A typical ordinary battery creates a potential difference of about 1.5 volts between its terminals. If the battery is not connected to anything, the potential difference is still there, and can be measured with a voltmeter. Only when a circuit is formed between the terminals of the battery will a path exist for electrons to flow, and electrons will be caused to flow. Current and voltage are linked by '''Ohm's Law''', which is a very simple linear relationship.

Once it was believed that electrons traveled from the positive side of a battery to the negative side. However, when the technology was there to test this it was proven that electrons actually traveled from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive terminal. When talking about circuits and designing them, we use '''conventional current''', which we measure as if charge flows from positive to negative - for practical purposes, the fact that the electrons really go the other way does not make any difference. The rest of this book follows standard practise and always assumes conventional current.

Current is measured in '''amperes''' or '''amps''' for short, though 1 amp is quite a large current so usually milliamps (1 thousandth of an amp) or microamps (1 millionth of an amp) are often used, especially in electronics.

To summarise: Current is the flow of charge. That charge can be thought of as flowing ''along'' the conductor. Voltage or potential difference is the force that gives rise to the current, and appears ''across'' a pair of points in a circuit, such as the terminals of a battery.


'''Conductors:'''
Conductors are materials that are packed full of easily-movable electrons. All metals are conductors. All materials offer some resistance but that shouldn't matter for now as long as you're not using any extremely long lengths of wire.

'''Open/Closed/Short Circuit:'''
An open circuit is one where there is a physical gap in the wire which does not allow charge to pass. A closed circuit is the path charge travels from one terminal of the battery to the other. A short circuit is where something like a piece of metal would fall onto two or more pieces of metal attached to the circuit and change the flow of electricity, resulting in undesired operation of the electronic device.

'''Circuit Diagrams:'''
It would be nearly impossible to take a picture of a complicated electronic circuit and expect people to build the same one. To solve this problem, circuit diagrams are used. In circuit diagrams wires are represented by lines. When lines cross over each other they may be connected depending on how the diagram is drawn.

''Example 1: Lines that intersect each other connect, and wires that have a loop where they cross are not connected'' [[Image:LearnElectronics-Images-Chapter1-diagram1.PNG]]

''Example 2: Lines that intersect each other do not connect. and lines that have a dot where they intersect are connected.'' [[Image:LearnElectronics-images-chapter1-Diagram2.PNG]]

I'll try to make this book use the second example but remember to pay attention to circuit diagrams for things like that.

===Electric power, energy, temperature, heat sinks, thermal resistance, and thermal capacitance===

Light bulbs, for example, are rated at 25 Watt (W), 60 W, 100 W, etc. That is the '''Power''' they use if and whenever they are switched on, never mind the length of time they are on.

A 100 W light bulb that is switched on uses '''Energy''' at the rate of 100 Watthours(Wh) per hour (Wh/h), 100 Wh if one hour, 200 Wh if 2 hours, etc. One Kilowatthour(kWh) is 1000 Wh.
Light from lightbulbs is only one of several forms of energy. Another form is heat. Heat is related to temperature.

There is a close relationship between energy and '''temperature'''. Electronic devices, such as diodes or transistors, have a &quot;rating&quot; of a number of Watts (W) at a given device temperature that must not be exceeded to prevent damage. For example in data sheets for transistors often there is a graph showing the collector current versus the collector-emitter voltage for different base currents. Always add, if it isn't there already, the power curve. For example, if a power transistor is rated at 50 W, then one point of this curve would be 10 Volt (V) x 5 Amperes (A), another 5V x 10 A, etc. If the outside temperature is higher, or there isn't a free flow of cooling air, then the power rating will be lower - this is called &quot;derating&quot;. Often electronic equipment includes an internal fan to keep the temperature down to below rated limits under all reasonable operating conditions.

'''[[w:Heat sink]]s''' are very important; they are used to reduce the temperature of the electronic device. This is done by mounting the device on a heat sink, usually via a heat-conducting chemical paste, and, if necessary, insulating heat-conducting washers, permitting as much heat as possible to be conducted from the device to the heat sink. The heat sink, which has a comparatively large surface area in touch with not only the device, but also with cooling air, then transfers its heat to that air, thus keeping the device's temperature lower than it would be without the heat sink, and also permitting therefore a larger power rating, and a larger current rating, without causing any damage to the device.

Just as electrical resistance (in DC circuits) is voltage divided by current (Volts per Ampere), similarly [[w:Thermal resistance|'''&quot;thermal resistance&quot;''']] is defined as degrees Celsius difference per Watt. Also '''[[w:Heat capacity|&quot;thermal capacitance&quot;]]''' is defined as Wattseconds per degree Celsius.

== Hands On ==

'''Basic light bulb circuit:'''
You will need a battery, low power light bulb with socket, and some wire.

== Understanding the Parts ==

[[image:batteries.jpg|framed|Real batteries]]
'''Battery: '''
Batteries use internal stored chemical energy to push electrons from one end to the other.
The battery will run out eventually when it uses up all its internal stored energy.

Circuit Diagram for battery: [[Image:Battery.png]]
[[image:Solderless Breadboard with LEDs.jpg|right|thumb|200px|solderless breadboard with LEDs and battery]]
'''Light Bulb:'''
(I plan on using an LED for the light as it does not need a socket and works with a breadboard) (what's a breadboard?)
A breadboard is a plastic board with lots of holes, which electronic components pins are pushed into. The holes are electrically connected in lines. (e.g. all the vertical lines are connected together).
([[Practical Electronics/Breadboard]])

'''Wires'''

Wires simply provide a pathway for electric current to travel

== Assembly ==
Now it's time to start building this circuit.

Connect one terminal of the battery to one terminal of the light bulb socket, and the other terminal of the battery to the other terminal of the light bulb socket. That's your first circuit.

[[Image:Resistor symbol.png]][[Image:resistors-photo.JPG|thumb|right|222px|Real Resistors]]

== Materials ==

== [[Electronics/DC Voltage and Current|Voltage]] Drop ==
* Think of a bucket full of water; nothing happens yet, if there is no hole at the bottom of the bucket. The height of the water in the bucket represents the electrical '''voltage'''.
* If there is a hole at the bottom of the bucket, then water will flow out of it. That water flow represents electric [[current]] [[FHSST Physics Electricity:Flow of Charge|flow]].
* If the source of the '''voltage''' is a battery, then, in time, the battery's '''voltage''' will be reduced until there is no '''voltage''' left, just as the level of the water in the bucket will get lower and lower until no water is left in the bucket, with zero level.
* If the source of the '''voltage''' is the socket in the wall, then the '''voltage''' will remain about the same; normally there will be only slight changes of that kind of '''voltage'''.

The voltage is the source of the current, and the current has some purpose, it flows through what is called a &quot;load&quot;, which may be one or more [[Electronics/Resistors|resistors]]. No current flows through a resistor or equivalent, unless there is a voltage acrosss the two terminals of the resistor. If there are at least 2 resistors, or equivalent, in series (like a river flowing via 3 points) then the voltage across each resistor is called '''voltage drop'''. Think of a river passing via points A, B, and C, where A is highest and C is lowest. There is a difference in the elevations/levels, with B minus A representing a '''voltage drop''', and C minus B being like another '''voltage drop'''. The sum of all of the '''voltage drops''' in a circuit always equals the supply voltage, such as the battery voltage.

== [[Electronics/Ohm's Law|Ohms Law]] ==
'''Resistors:'''
[[Electronics/Resistors|Resistors]] &quot;resist&quot; the flow of electricity, reducing the amount of the current (measured in units called amps). Without a resistor in the circuit the current would be too high, you would ruin parts of the circuit, use up the battery too fast, or even blow the battery. Since resistors are too small to print numbers on them they are labeled with color coded bands that have to be interpreted. Resistors have 3 or 4 colorbands on them, but only the first 3 matter for now. The fourth one is either silver or gold. Silver means it is 10% above or below the value shown by the first 3 bands, while gold means 5% above or below. The first 2 bands represent a one decimal number, the third represents the number of zeros that follow.


[[Electronics/Resistors|Resistors]] follow '''Ohm's Law''': '''&lt;math&gt;V=IR&lt;/math&gt;''' ('''''V'''=Voltage, '''I'''=Current (in amps), '''R'''=Resistance (in ohms)'')

[[Electronics/Ohm's Law|Ohm's law]] is important to remember since most electronic components have a maximum and minimum voltage and amp rating: if they're too low it wouldn't work, and if they're too high it will destroy the component. As long as you have at least two values you can solve for the last one.

A trick to remember is that the decimal number of a color band is equal to the amount of zeros added to the end if it's the third band.

== Series &amp; Parallel ==

(need circuit diagram of resistors in parallel and in series)

Definition of series: In electronics when something is connected in series like a resistor it means that you have resistors that are in a &quot;line&quot;. The resistors are connected end to end.

Definition of Parallel: The same wire is connected to one end of all the parts in parallel and another wire is connected to the other end of all the parts in parallel.

(Math for resistors in series and parallel):

Resistors in series: Add their values (in Ohms) to obtain the total resistance of their combination.

Resistors in parallel: The reciprocal (means: one divided by) of the total resistance of the combination of two resistors R1 and R2 is
           1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2,    also l/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3  if there are 3, and so on.

Resistors are very useful in electronic design.

== My guide ==

I created a personal guide for creating new books at [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide]]. This guide represents my own personal opinions on the matter, but I think it is a helpful resource nonetheless. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:46, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

== Can I do this...? ==

I currently run an Open Source C++ project, and I was wondering if I would be allowed to start a new book documenting the usage of functions and methods in this project. It could be considered a way to make users familiar with the code. Thanks. --[[User:XTZGZoReX|- Zor]] ([[User talk:XTZGZoReX|talk]]) 08:26, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

: This is a gray area. Please see [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] for more information. You should raise this in the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General|general reading room]] with more details about this project. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 09:36, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

== Can I do this? (2) ==

Would I be allowed to put together a collection of homework questions and their explained answers? Many of these questions are from textbooks (not verbatim, but close enough), and sometimes pictures are included from the textbook, or the online homework problem. Would I be allowed to include the questions, the pictures (from a book or online source), and (obviously) the answers? Also, if I'm not allowed to use their pictures, would I be allowed to reconstruct my own, and use those? [[User:Maslen|Maslen]] ([[User talk:Maslen|talk]]) 14:04, 4 November 2010 (UTC)
:Copying any other material unless it is appropriately licensed to allow copying, or public domain, is forbidden by copyright law. The same applies to images. Even if the text is free to copy, often the images are not. As a book, your idea is fine, but you need to find a way of constructing it without breaching somebody else's copyright. See [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] for more information. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:07, 4 November 2010 (UTC)

::Could you please give a yes/no answer in regards to whether I'd be allowed to add the questions from other sources ( if not verbatim, with my own pictures)? [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] doesn't seem to be particularly clear on this topic. [[User:Maslen|Maslen]] ([[User talk:Maslen|talk]]) 14:59, 4 November 2010 (UTC)
:::[[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] and the [[Scouting]] book both incorporate verbatim questions from a published source and provide answers created by the community.  The amount of text in the answers far exceeds the amount in the questions.  Illustrations are a more dodgy topic.  I have seen images deleted from the Commons because they were reproductions of some other copyrighted work.  Wikibooks hosts few images (we limit that to fair-use images, because the Commons won't host them).  Wikibook's upload page redirects to the Commons where there are people well-versed in those questions.  You could take that up with them and see what they say. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:23, 4 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

=Lesson 1 - Alphabet and pronunciation=
The Slovio language can be written either using Latin alphabet based on English, which is purely ASCII, or using a cyrillic alphabet, which is based on Russian. This guide will mostly use the Latin alphabet for simplicity and not to overwhelm learners, but you should familiarize yourself with cyrillic as well. This is the basic Slovio alphabet, both in Latin and the corresponding cyrillic:

 A  B  C  Cx  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  R  S  Sx  T  U  V  Z  Zx
 А  Б  Ц  Ч   Д  Е  Ф  Г  Х  И  Й  К  Л  М  Н  О  П  Р  С  Ш   Т  У  В  З  Ж

 a  b  c  cx  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  r  s  sx  t  u  v  z  zx
 а  б  ц  ч   д  е  ф  г  х  и  й  к  л  м  н  о  п  р  с  ш   т  у  в  з  ж

cx, sx, and zx are always represented by two characters in conjunction and form only one letter each.

&lt;div style=&quot;width:25%;font-size:x-small;float:right; border:1px solid black;padding:0.5em;background:#FFFFE5&quot;&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange;font-weight:bold;font-size:large&quot;&gt;! TIP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Czech, Slovak and Polish speakers
* '''cx'''  = '''ч, č, cz''' 
* '''sx'''  = '''ш, š, sz'''
* '''zx'''  = '''ж, ž, ż'''  
* '''gx'''  = '''дж, џ, dž, dż'''
* '''wx'''  =  '''щ, шт, шј, št, ś, ć, šč, szcz'''
&lt;/div&gt;

Vowels are pronounced the same way they would be in German or  Polish.

{|cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0
|'''a''' || - || c'''a'''r

|'''e''' || - || b'''e'''t
|-
|'''i''' || - || s'''ee'''
|-
|'''o''' || - || b'''o'''ld
|-
|'''u''' || - || f'''oo'''t
|}

Consonant pronunciation:

{|cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0
|'''b''' || - || '''b'''old
|-
|'''c''' || - || ca'''ts'''
|-
|'''cx''' || - || '''ch'''eese

|-
|'''v''' || - || '''v'''anilla
|-
|'''z''' || - || '''z'''oo
|-
|'''zx''' || - || plea'''s'''ure
|}

As in most Slavic languages, '''r''' should be rolled. 

'''J''' is used only in some cases:
# When '''j''' sound is at the beginning of the word.
# In suffixes like ''-ju'', ''-just'', etc.

Otherwise, '''i''' is used to represent that sound.

Slovio also includes several optional letters, mainly for expressing sounds of foreign words:
:Gx  Wx  X
:Дж  Щ   Кс

'''Gx''' is used to present the sound that would be formed by &quot;dzx&quot;, as in '''''G'''eor'''g'''e''. '''Wx''' is used to present the &quot;sxcx&quot; sound, as in ''Yu'''shch'''enko''. '''X''', if used apart from '''cx''', '''sx''' or '''zx''', is equivalent to &quot;ks&quot;, as in ''bo'''x'''''.

== Pronunciation and stresses ==

In cases of vowel combination (like ''ai'', ''oi'', ''io'', ''uo'', etc.) it is recommended to pronounce the combination as one diphthong. 

It is recommended to accent the penultimate syllable (the syllable before the last one).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Understanding C++ ==

I see you've decided that you'd like to contribute to the Understanding C++ book. I definitely want to encourage you to contribute and hope we can work together. To that end I'd like to inform you a little bit about the intention of the book. The book is intended to be for people who already know how to use a computer fairly well. Like how to navigate whatever OS they use, run programs, and know how to get new programs on there computer. So basic computer knowledge in other words.

What the book doesn't assume though is the reader know what programs consist of, how they do their work and why they would need to learn a language like C++ if they want to learn to make programs, which is what [[Understanding C++/Introduction]] is for. I think that might be similar in purpose to the Computer and Programming languages chapter. However the main difference is that I didn't think it would be helpful to people who've decided to learn C++ to be distracted by material about other programming languages.

The different programming paradigms wasn't really something I had thought about covering because I thought that could be distracting as well, and thought if they were to be covered at all they would be covered as the book progresses. Like functional programming might be touched a bit in the chapter on Functions.

You may have also noticed the focus is on standard C++ only, this is intended to keep this book very focused and helpful for beginners. I hope this book can made to be both fun to read and interesting to read at the same time. In my own experience with programming book, when they are not too dry, have a lot of illustrations and provide a lot of fun examples, I learned quicker, and that is what my hope is for this book too.

I saw what you said in the reading room and I do agree with most of it. I just don't think the C++ for dummies book is a good example to follow, because I like a lot of people that I'm aware of in the C++ community, don't think that book teaches how to use C++ correctly. I don't intend to have any specific size limit for this book, but I do know there are some well written C++ programming books that are less than 1,000 pages, and some poorly written C++ programming books over 1,000 pages, so to me size isn't a good measure or indicator of how good a book is. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:22, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

Oh also, I wouldn't mind discussing and throwing ideas around about how to approach teaching standard C++. I only have a few basic things in place that I'd like to keep. The Core section, which to me is intended for things like variables (which includes arrays and pointers), functions, classes, control flow, templates, exceptions, etc. with a taste of the standard library and other concepts important to C++ programming. The advance section for things like lists, trees, hash tables, basic ways to optimize program that don't depend on what compiler is used and the like, etc. The standard library section for understanding how to use everything in the standard library like string, map, stacks, queues, sets, etc. which hopefully by the time a person reads this section they will have already a pretty good grasp of how they work. Besides what each section of the book should contain I haven't really figured out yet where to begin with teaching C++, as can be seen by how basically the only thing present being an introductory to programming. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:48, 16 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

=Lesson 2 - Introducing youself=

Please take a look at how Ana might introduce herself:

:&lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;padding:2px&quot; &gt;''Imenijm Ana. Ja es ucxnik.''&lt;/span&gt;

Vocabulary:
 imenit - name (verb, &quot;to be named&quot;)
 ja     - I
 es     - to be
 ucxnik - student

Ana introduced herself with &quot;imenijm Ana&quot;, meaning &quot;my name is Ana&quot;. ''Imenijm'' is the first person singular form of the verb &lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;padding:2px&quot; &gt;''imenit''&lt;/span&gt; in the present tense. In this case, it was unnecessary to use personal pronoun ''ja'' (I), as it would be in most Slavic languages, as it is assumed that subject is &quot;ja&quot; from the verb suffix ''-ijm''.

== Verb conjugation (delaslovju koniugenie) ==

Verbs are conjugated by adding a suffix to the stem of the word. Stems are formed by removing the infinitive ending '''-t''' (if the stem ends in ''o''), '''-it''' (if it ends in a consonant) or '''-vit''' (if it ends in ''a'', ''e'', ''i'' or ''u''). The verb endings for the present tense are: ijm, ijsx, ijt, ime, ite and ijut, if the word ends in a consonant as seen in this example:

{|cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 border=1 align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;| Slovio
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;| English
|-
| width=&quot;50%&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ijm'''
| width=&quot;50%&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |my name is
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ijsx'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |your name is
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ijt'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |her, his, its name is
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ime''' 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |our name is
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ite'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |your (plural) name is
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|imen'''ijut''' 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |their name is
|}

So, for example:
 &lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC&quot; &gt;Mlodic imenijt Dusxan.&lt;/span&gt; - Boy is named Dushan. (literal translation)&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC&quot; &gt;Imenime Vikibuks.&lt;/span&gt;      - Our name is Wikibooks.

Words that end in a vowel lose '''i''' in the ending, so the endings are: -jm, -jsx, -jt, -me, -te and -jut. The use of '''i''' in such cases is optional, but it is easier to omit it. For example: dela'''t''' (to work), would be delajm, delajsx, delajt, delame, delate or delajut.

== Pronouns (zamenslovis) ==

Pronouns in Slovio appear in three forms:
# Subject (nominative)
# Object
# Possessive

This is a table of pronouns when they are in the subject position:

{|cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 border=1 align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Singular
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Plural
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''ja''' 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |I 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''mi''' 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |we
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''ti'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |you
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''vi'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |you (pl.)
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''to''' 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |3rd person 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''oni'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |they
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''on'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |he
|
|
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''ona'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |she
|
|
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot;|'''ono'''
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; |it
|
|
|-
| colspan=&quot;4&quot; bgcolor=&quot;antiquewhite&quot;|Please take a look at '''to'''. It is a gender neutral form of third person singular, and can be used to designate either he, she or it. Plural equivalent, '''oni''' is also gender neutral.
|}

== Verb 'to be' (delaslov 'but') == 

Conjugation of the verb 'to be' in slovio is very easy, it is '''es''' in every case. If the verb is used without a pronoun, verb personal ending (see above section) is added to the stem '''es'''.

{|cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 border=1 align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|Slovio
!  bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|English
!  bgcolor=&quot;#CCCCCC&quot;|Without pronoun
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; width=&quot;33%&quot;|ja es 
| bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; width=&quot;33%&quot;|I am 
| bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot; width=&quot;34%&quot;|esijm
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |ti es 
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; | you are
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot; | esijsx
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |to es 
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; | he/she/it is 
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esijt
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |on es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; | he is
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esijt
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |ona es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot;| she is
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esijt
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |ono es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot;| it is
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esijt
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |mi es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; | we are
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esime
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |vi es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot; | you are
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esite
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCCC&quot; |oni es
|bgcolor=&quot;#99CCFF&quot;| they are
|bgcolor=&quot;#00FFCC&quot;| esijut
|}

For example, Ana said:
:&lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;padding:2px&quot; &gt;''Ja es ucxnik.''&lt;/span&gt;

Meaning ''I am a student.'' She also could have said &lt;span style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;padding:2px&quot; &gt;''Esijm ucxnik''&lt;/span&gt;.

Could you have a look at [[:pl:Hiszpański]]. It is the base for language textbooks, which might help you with building this student's book, and making it easy to understand, etc. [[User:Sblive|Sblive]] 09:36, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called LinoBarreca. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name LinoBarreca~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Your account will be renamed ==

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Raging Bull. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Raging Bull~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Civil Procedure|Overview of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (with selected Arizona Rules)}}

Most law school students learn the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which have been adopted in their entirety by many States, although a significant number US states (including California, New York and Pennsylvania) have distinctively different Rules of Civil Procedure. Even if the text of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is not adopted in its entirety by a state, the state may end up using the same numbering system. Even though the Federal Rules allow lawyers to easily adapt to practice in new jurisdictions, it is important to read the local rules of civil procedure.    

Most law schools teach civil procedure by teaching the concept of jurisdiction before teaching the technical rules. 

Wikibooks asks for discussion of this topic, but there really isn't much to discuss.  Civil Procedure, or CivPro as it's known to law students, simply describes the process by which civil (not criminal, that's a different set of rules) cases are brought into the court system and how they are handled procedurally once they are in the system. CivPro gives detailed rules for such issues as how to start a law case, what sort of notice you must give to the other party and how, how to tell the judge that you want him or her to do something, what information you are entitled to get from the other party or parties and how to do it (the process called discovery), how to conduct civil trials, and the like.  

A civil case is one in which one party or group of parties, usually not the government, sues another party or group of parties claiming they did or were about to do something wrong.  The wrongs sued about are generally in three categories: tort, contract, and other.

Contract actions are, as the term suggests, about enforcing (or not enforcing) contracts.  Often these are written contracts, but oral contracts are perfectly legal and enforceable IF the court can decide exactly what the terms agreed on were: the problem with oral contracts is not whether they are enforceable, but what the actual contract was, since usually party A says one thing and party B says another.

Tort actions seek redress for some wrong done by another person (legally a person includes corporations, governments, etc.)  Tort claims can range widely, from suing over damages from a dog bite, to auto accidents, to a branch from your tree falling on my roof, to your borrowing my lawnmower and not returning it. Almost any civil harm you can think of, including asking the court to award you millions of dollars because a business temporarily lost a pair of your pants.  Don't laugh, it happened.

The civil courts also deal with many sorts of cases which are neither contract nor tort.  The list is almost endless, but it includes such things as divorces, paternity cases, landlord-tenant disputes, probate (estate settlement, guardianship and conservatorship issues), ordering a parent to allow a child to undergo necessary medical treatment which the parent is resisting, injunctions (asking the court to order someone to stop doing something they are doing or not to do something they plan to do), and on and on.  

Basically, any action that isn't the government bringing criminal charges against a person is a civil action.  

The Rules of Civil Procedure, by the way, are only one of the sets of rules that govern the practice of law.  Most states in the U.S. (maybe all except Louisiana) have numerous sets of rules which govern, for example, their criminal, their appellate courts, and their business operations, with general rules applicable to all situations, and many other collections of rules.  And most local courts even have their own sets of rules which supplement state rules.

== Jurisdiction ==

Federal courts have two forms of jurisdiction.  General jurisdiction covers normal civil litigation subject to two conditions.  One, the two parties must come from two different states.  Two, the damages claimed in the lawsuit must exceed $75,000.  What this means is that, so long as both participants are US citizens, a general jurisdiction case can be heard in at least one state court as well.  Either party can move for removal of the case to Federal court, which they may do for a variety of strategic reasons.  Federal courts often have a shorter docket, meaning that the case may be heard more quickly than in state court.  

Courts also have subject matter jurisdiction, which means that the federal courts have the power to hear the particular type of case regardless of the requirements of general jurisdiction.  A short list of the type of claims that can be heard in federal court because of subject matter jurisdiction: copyright claims, civil rights claims, bankruptcy cases, and admiralty claims.

Once jurisdiction is found, the claim advances to the pleading stage of the pre-trial.

== Pleadings ==

Unlike many state courts, the federal courts have a simplified pleading system called notice pleading.  Notice pleading requires a “short and plain statement of claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief” in the complaint.  The complaint is met with the answer, which is a document that admits or denies the allegations made in the complaint, as well as making any counter-claims the defendant may have against the defendant (any counter-claim, although it is required that any counter claim arising from the same incident be litigated in the same trial).

A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint in writing before the trial court '''(Rule 3).'''  
The filing is made at the trial court clerk's office.  
A complaint is one of the allowed pleadings.  
The plaintiff's claim against a defendant is contained in the complaint.  
There are two types of pleadings: reclamatory and responsive pleadings.  
The complaint is a reclamatory pleading.  
The answer to the complaint is a responsive pleading.&lt;br&gt;
A pleading must contain a short and plain statement '''(Rule 8(a)):'''
* of the grounds upon which the court’s jurisdiction depends, unless it already has jurisdiction and needs no new grounds to support it
** Subject matter jurisdiction is based on: 
# Federal nature of the claim (claims “arising under” the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the U.S.) 
# Diversity of citizenship
; Venue : place of trial
; Personal jurisdiction : the court must have the power to render judgment against a defendant
* of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief
* a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks

UNLESS you are alleging fraud or mistake - then you must plead the specific circumstances '''(Rule 9(b)).'''

A pleading must be:
* in numbered paragraphs by allegation '''(Rule 10(b))'''
* signed by at least one attorney of record '''(Rule 11(a))'''
* certified by the attorney that it is presented after a reasonable inquiry under the circumstances '''(Rule 11(b))''' and
** it is not being presented for improper purpose, such as to harass, delay, or add costs '''(Rule 11(b)(1))'''
** the claims, defenses, and legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for the extension of the law or establishment of new law '''(Rule 11(b)(2))'''
** the allegations and factual contentions have evidentiary support – or are likely to have support after discovery '''(Rule 11(b)(3))'''

A pleading does not have to be consistent, it can contain alternative theories '''(Rule 8(e)(2)).'''

Service of the summons and complaint must be made within 120 days after filing '''(Rule 4(m)).'''


'''SUMMONS AND WAIVER OF SERVICE – RULE 4'''

Upon or after filing complaint, the plaintiff may present a summons to the clerk for signature and seal '''(Rule 1(b)).''' 

Summons shall be served together with a copy of the complaint '''(Rule 4(c)(1)).'''

OR 

Plaintiff can notify defendant of the commencement of the action and request that the defendant waiver service '''(Rule 4(d)(2)).'''

The notice and request must:
* be in writing and addressed directly to the defendant '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(A))'''
* be dispatched through first-class mail or other reliable means '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(B))'''
* be accompanied by a copy of complaint and identify the court in which it was filed '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(C))'''
* inform defendant the consequences of compliance or refusal '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(D))'''
* set forth the date on which the request was sent '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(E))'''
* allow a reasonable time for return – 30 days from which it was sent '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(F))'''
* provide an extra copy of notice and request and pre-paid means of compliance in writing '''(Rule 4(d)(2)(G))'''

If defendant refuses waiver, he must pay plaintiff costs, including reasonable attorney fees to collect costs.

Defendant must answer within 21 days after being served with complaint '''(Rule 12(a)(1)(A)).'''

If service of summons is waived – the defendant must answer within 60 days after the request for waiver was sent '''(Rule 12(a)(1)(B)).'''

 
'''DEFENDANT PRE-ANSWER MOTIONS – RULE 12'''

Defendant may make these pre-answer motions:
* Motion for more definite statement '''(Rule 12(e))''' – (if granted, plaintiff must reply 10 days after notice of order) 
* Motion to strike redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter '''(Rule 12(f))''' – (LOST AFTER DEFENDANT ANSWERS)

Also, the following defenses may, at the option of the pleader, be made by motion '''(Rule 12(b)):'''
* lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter '''(Rule 12(b)(1))'''
* lack of jurisdiction over the person '''(Rule 12(b)(2))''' – (LOST AFTER DEFENDANT ANSWERS)
* improper venue '''(Rule 12(b)(3))''' – (LOST AFTER DEFENDANT ANSWERS)
* insufficiency of process '''(Rule 12(b)(4))''' – (LOST AFTER DEFENDANT ANSWERS)
* insufficiency of service of process '''(Rule 12(b)(5))''' – (LOST AFTER DEFENDANT ANSWERS)
* failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted '''(Rule 12(b)(6))'''
* failure to join a party under '''Rule 19''' '''(Rule 12(b)(7))'''

Must consolidate '''Rule 12''' motions '''(Rule 12(g))''' – (any motion available at the time that is left out is forever lost.  EXCEPTIONS: '''Rule 12(b)(6):''' failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted AND '''Rule 12(b)(1):''' lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter - (these can be raised at any time)).

Defendant must answer within 10 days after denial or postponement of motion '''(Rule 12(a)(4)(A)).'''


'''DEFAULT JUDGMENT FROM FAILURE TO ANSWER – RULE 55'''

If defendant fails to answer, the plaintiff may bring an affidavit of this fact to the clerk of the court, who will enter the party’s default.

Plaintiff must show that:
# the complaint was served properly, and
# the defendant did not answer '''(Rule 55(a))'''

If claim is for a sum certain, the clerk can enter default judgment '''(Rule 55(b)(1)).'''

If claim is for uncertain amount, the party entitled to judgment by default must apply to the court for damages '''(Rule 55(b)(2)).'''

However, the court can set aside the entry of default for good cause with a motion filed within one year under '''Rule 60(b)''' - '''(Rule 55(c))''' [Reasons: mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect or fraud].

If the defendant has appeared in the action – s/he is entitled to a 3-day written notice of the application for default judgment '''(Rule 55(b)(2)).'''
 
Defendant must answer within 21 days after being served with complaint '''(Rule 12(a)(1)(A)).''' (was 20 days, prior to 2007 amendments; is also calculated as calendar days unless final day falls on a court holiday/weekend; then it's due the next court day). 

If service of summons is waived – the defendant must answer within 60 days after the request for waiver was sent '''(Rule 12(a)(1)(B)).'''

Defendant must answer within 21 days after denial or postponement of motion '''(Rule 12(a)(4)(A)).''' (was 10 days, before 2007 amendments)


'''ANSWER – RULE 8'''

Defendant must state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted in the complaint '''(Rule 8(b)).''' - (UNLESS you are alleging fraud or mistake - then you must state the specific circumstances '''(Rule 9(b))''').

Defendant must specifically admit, deny, or claim insufficient knowledge or information to each of the allegations upon which the plaintiff relies '''(Rule 8(b)).'''

General denials are not allowed – must specify which part is denied and which part is admitted '''(Rule 9(b)).'''

Without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth = denial '''(Rule 9(b))''' &lt;br&gt;
Failure to deny = admittance '''(Rule 8(d))'''

Answer must set forth affirmative defenses (“true, but…”) such as: accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, contributory negligence, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel (issue preclusion), failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, ''res judicata'' (claim preclusion), statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense '''(Rule 8(c)).'''

An answer does not have to be consistent, it can contain alternative theories '''(Rule 8(e)(2)).''' 

 
'''POST-ANSWER PLAINTIFF MOTIONS – RULE 12'''

Plaintiff may make these post-answer motions:
* Motion for judgment on the pleadings = (&quot;so what?&quot;) – (cannot include matters outside of the pleadings.  If you do, then it is treated as '''Rule 56''' summary judgment '''(Rule 12(c))''')
* Motion to strike redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter '''(Rule 12(f))'''

Must consolidate '''Rule 12''' motions '''(Rule 12(g))''' – (any motion available at the time that is left out is forever lost). 


'''POST-ANSWER DEFENDANT MOTIONS – RULE 12'''

Defendant may make these post-answer motions:
* Motion for judgment on the pleadings = (&quot;so what?&quot;) – (cannot include matters outside of the pleadings - if you do, then it is treated as '''Rule 56''' summary judgment '''(Rule 12(c))''')
* lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter '''(Rule 12(b)(1))'''
* failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted '''(Rule 12(b)(6))''' – (cannot look beyond the pleadings, cannot attach evidence - if you attach documents, then it will be treated as a motion for '''Rule 56''' summary judgment)
* failure to join a party under '''Rule 19''' '''(Rule 12(b)(7))'''

Must consolidate '''Rule 12''' motions '''(Rule 12(g))''' – (any motion available at the time that is left out is forever lost.  EXCEPTIONS: '''Rule 12(b)(6):''' failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted AND '''Rule 12(b)(1):''' lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter - (these can be raised at any time))


'''COUNTERCLAIM AND CROSS-CLAIM – RULE 13'''

Compulsory Counterclaims: A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which, at the time of serving the pleading, the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require, for its adjudication, the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction '''(Rule 13(a)).'''

Permissive Counterclaims: A pleading may state as a counterclaim any claim against an opposing party not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim '''(Rule 13(b)).'''

Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired After Pleading: A claim which either matured or was acquired by the pleader after serving a pleading may, with the permission of the court, be presented as a counterclaim by supplemental pleading '''(Rule 13(e)).'''

Omitted Counterclaim: When a pleader fails to set up a counterclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, or when justice requires, the pleader may, by leave of court, set up the counterclaim by amendment '''(Rule 13(f)).'''
 
At least 21 days before a scheduling conference is held or scheduling order is due under '''Rule 16(b).''' 


'''RULE 26(f) CONFERENCE – PLANNING FOR DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY'''

Parties must confer to consider the nature and basis of their claims and defenses and the possibilities for a prompt settlement or resolution of the case, to make or arrange for the disclosures required by '''Rule 26(a)(1),''' and to develop a proposed discovery plan that indicates the parties' views and proposals concerning: 
# what changes should be made in the timing, form, or requirement for disclosures under '''Rule 26(a)''', including a statement as to when disclosures under '''Rule 26(a)(1)''' were made or will be made; 
# the subjects on which discovery may be needed, when discovery should be completed, and whether discovery should be conducted in phases or be limited to or focused upon particular issues; 
# what changes should be made in the limitations on discovery imposed under these rules or by local rule, and what other limitations should be imposed; and 
# any other orders that should be entered by the court under '''Rule 26(c)''' or under '''Rules 16(b)''' and '''(c)'''

Parties must attempt in good faith to agree on the proposed discovery plan, and submit a written report outlining the plan within 14 days after the conference. 

Pre-Discovery Disclosure must be within 14 days after the '''Rule 26(f)''' conference.


'''FEDERAL PRE-DISCOVERY DISCLOSURE – RULE 26(a)(1)'''

Each party, without waiting for a discovery request, must provide to the other parties:
* (A) the name, address, and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment (note, however, that you are rolling the dice that the judge will agree that it is solely for impeachment and not, instead, an affirmative defense), identifying the subjects of the information; 
* (B) a copy of, or a description by category and location of, all documents, data compilations, and tangible things that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party and that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless solely for impeachment; 
* (C) a computation of any category of damages claimed by the disclosing party, making available for inspection and copying, as under '''Rule 34''', the documents or other evidentiary material, not privileged or protected from disclosure, on which such computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered; and 
* (D) for inspection and copying, as under '''Rule 34''', any insurance agreement under which any person carrying on an insurance business may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment which may be entered in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment. 

Disclosure of Expert Testimony '''(Rule 26(a)(2)):'''

* An expert witness is someone who is specially employed to provide testimony '''(Rule 26(a)(2)(B))'''
* Must disclose the identity of expert witnesses '''(Rule 26(a)(2)(A))'''
* Must include written report signed by witness.
** This report must contain:
*** a complete statement of opinions to be expressed and the basis and reasons therefore,
*** the data and other information considered by the witness in forming the opinion,
*** any exhibits to be used as a summary of or support for the opinions,
*** the qualifications of witness,
*** a list of all publications authored by the witness within the preceding ten years,

Disclosures of expert witnesses must be made at least 90 days before the trial date – or if used solely to contradict, within 30 days after the disclosure is made by the other party.
 
[Arizona pre-discovery disclosure must be made within 40 days after defendant’s answer (AZ Rule 26.1(b)(1)).]


'''ARIZONA PRE-DISCOVERY DISCLOSURE – RULE 26.1(a)'''

information relevant to the events, transactions, or occurrences that gave rise to the action, and
the nature of the knowledge or information each such individual is believed to possess. &lt;br&gt;

grounds for each opinion, the qualifications of the witness and the name and address of the
custodian of copies of any reports prepared by the expert. &lt;br&gt;
(7) A computation and the measure of damage alleged by the disclosing party and the documents
or testimony on which such computation and measure are based and the names, addresses,

documents that the disclosing party plans to use at trial and relevant insurance agreements. &lt;br&gt;
(9) A list of the documents or list of the categories of documents, known by a party to exist whether or not in the party's possession, custody or control and which that party believes may be relevant to the subject matter of the action, and those which appear reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and the date(s) upon which those documents will be made, or have been made, available for inspection and copying. Unless good cause is stated for not doing so, a copy of each document listed shall be served with the disclosure. If production is not made, the name and address of the custodian of the document shall be indicated. A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business. &lt;br&gt;

If feasible, counsel shall meet to exchange disclosures; otherwise, the disclosures shall be served as provided by Rule 5 - (AZ Rule 26.1(b)(1))

The duty shall be a continuing duty, and each party shall make additional or amended disclosures whenever new or different information is discovered or revealed. Such additional or amended disclosures shall be made seasonably, but in no event more than thirty (30) days after the information is revealed to or discovered by the disclosing party (AZ Rule 26.1 B)

When information is withheld from disclosure or discovery on a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial preparation materials, the claim shall be made expressly and shall be supported by a description of the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced or disclosed that is sufficient to enable other parties to contest the claim.

* The Rule above '''(Rule 35(b)(1))''' also applies to examinations made by agreement between the parties and not by motion of the court – unless the agreement between the parties expressly provides otherwise '''(Rule 35(b)(3))'''

 
'''DISCOVERY (Continued) – RULES 26, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, and 45'''

* Motion must include certification that movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with opposing party '''(Rule 37(a)(2))'''

* Sanctions are limited under '''Rule 37''' to attorney fees and costs; however, if the opposing party has not responded at all to discovery, then the court may order additional sanctions '''(Rule 37(c))'''

Defenses to Discovery requests '''(Rule 26(c)):'''
* Discovery that is only for annoyance, embarrassment, oppression '''(Rule 26(c))'''
* Discovery that causes undue burden or expense '''(Rule 26(c))'''
* Privileged information – must file motion for protective order '''(Rule 26(c)):'''
** Physician-patient information
** Attorney work product '''(Rule 26(b)(3))''':
*** Documents or tangible things prepared by other party’s attorney, consultant, agent, or insurer in anticipation of litigation 
*** Test to see if it is attorney work product = First, &quot;is it relevant?&quot; If yes…
**** Is it prepared in anticipation of litigation?
**** Was it prepared by or on behalf of attorney?
***** If yes, it is the attorney’s work product and is protected.
****** Even so, the other side may get it discovered if the other party shows it has substantial need of the material; and is unable, without undue hardship, to obtain equivalent information - UNLESS, it contains the mental impressions, conclusions, or opinions of the attorney = then it is still protected.
******* Attorney-client privilege does not extend to underlying facts of issue, just the communication.
******* In all cases, must file motion for protective order to prevent discovery '''(Rule 26(c))'''

Subpoena of non-party – '''Rule 45'''

Must get a subpoena to force non-parties to: (1) give testimony, (2) request documents, and (3) permit inspection of premises '''(Rule 45(a)).'''

Subpoenaed person may make motion with court to quash or modify subpoena '''(Rule 45(c)(3)).''' 

Failure by a person to obey subpoena may be deemed a contempt of court '''(Rule 45(e)).'''
 
Plaintiff: May make motion after the expiration of 20 days from the commencement of the action or after service of a motion for summary judgment by defendant.

Defendant: May make motion at any time.


'''SUMMARY JUDGMENT – RULE 56'''

A party may move for summary judgment with or without supporting affidavits '''(Rule 56(a)).'''

The motion shall be served at least 10 days before the time fixed for the hearing.  The adverse party prior to the day of hearing may serve opposing affidavits '''(Rule 56(c)).'''

The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits '''(Rule 56(e)).'''

Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge '''(Rule 56(e)).'''

Affidavits must set forth specific facts (who, what, when, where) showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  One needs more than mere conclusion '''(Rule 56(e)).'''

When affidavits are unavailable, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained, depositions to be taken, or discovery to be had or may make such other order as may be just '''(Rule 56(f)).'''

If it is made in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall order the offending party to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur, including reasonable attorney's fees, and any offending party or attorney may be adjudged as guilty of contempt '''(Rule 56(g)).'''

If the adverse party does not so respond, then summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party '''(Rule 56(e)).'''

A factual issue defeats summary judgment.  (It does not matter if you have 50 witnesses to 1).  Summary judgment does not weigh the evidence.  The question is: &quot;Is there a genuine issue of material fact?&quot;

 
'''VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL BY PLAINTIFF – RULE 41(a)'''

An action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court by '''(Rule 41(a)(1)):'''
* filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service by the adverse party of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment
* by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action 

Unless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed an action based on the same claim '''(Rule 41(a)(1)).'''

If dismissal is WITHOUT prejudice, the complaint CAN be refiled.


'''INVOLUNTARY DISMISSAL BY MOTION OF DEFENDANT – RULE 41(b)'''

A defendant may move for dismissal of an action for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute '''(Rule 41(b)).'''

An involuntary dismissal, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under '''Rule 19''', operates as an adjudication upon the merits (so the dismissal is with prejudice). 

If dismissal is WITH prejudice, the complaint CANNOT be refiled.

 
'''DEFAULT JUDGMENT – RULE 55'''

Plaintiff may ask for default judgment when the defendant fails to plead or otherwise defend.  Plaintiff must make this fact by affidavit to the clerk of the court.

Affidavit must show that: 
* the complaint was served properly, and 
* the defendant did not answer '''(Rule 55(a))'''

Upon receipt of a valid affidavit, the clerk shall enter the party's default.

If the claim is for a sum certain, and the defendant has been defaulted for failure to appear, then the clerk shall enter default judgment '''(Rule 55(b)(1)).'''

If claim is for an uncertain amount, or if the defendant has appeared before the court, then the party entitled to judgment by default must apply to the court for damages '''(Rule 55(b)(2)).'''

If the party has appeared in the action, then they must be served with written notice of the application for judgment at least 3 days prior to the hearing on such application '''(Rule 55(b)(2)).'''

The court can set aside the entry of default for good cause '''(Rule 55(c)).'''

The court can set aside the entry of default or default judgment for good cause, in accordance with '''Rule 60(b) (Rule 55(c)).'''

Default can come into effect if the answer is stricken under '''Rule 37''' – (as if the defendant had never appeared).

'''Creating a frame for a picture''' can be an expensive and confusing task. This Wikibook attempts to address this by providing instructions to allow you to do it yourself!

The book is currently broken into pages, which attempt to address the various stages required to produce a basic, though gallery quality, picture frame. There are additional pages which address special techniques and outline methods to handle complex items (such as boxing gloves).

This book began life as a summary of experience from someone new to the area, and will hopefully be built upon to become a useful reference and guide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Equipment suggested for picture framing ==
*Sharp pencil (2B recommended, as it will leave clear sharp lines)
*Notebook (for recording colours for matboard, frame types and measurements - and for calculating costs)
*Retractable tape measure
*Metal ruler
*Sharp knife
:Retractable snap-off bladed knife works well.

=== Frame cutting and assembly ===
*Mitre saw, or guillotine
*Bounding tape thing
*Corner tacking gun, with tacks

=== Glass cutting ===
*Oil filled glass cutter
*Cotton gloves

=== Mat cutting ===
*Square and rightangle ruler based cutter
:Note: a ruler and a knife just doesn't cut it ;)

== Advanced stuff ==

=== Sample mat board collection ===

=== Storage ===

==== Mat board ====
The spare mat board is easy to store in an old map drawer cabinet. These can be often be picked up at ex-government furniture stores.

==== Glass ====


==== Frame material ====
Standing against the wall, or up in the rafters.

*Leave a gap at the bottom of the frame, between the paper and the matt, to allow for dust to settle inside the matt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When choosing the appropriate surround for artwork, it is helpful to keep in mind several variables:

*Do you need to crop the picture?
*Is the piece destined for a single location?
*What materials do you have on hand?
*Will you need to re-use the frame?

And finally, and probably most importantly:
*Will your partner agree with your choice?

      <text xml:space="preserve">When selecting a frame, decide on the colour, window size and area of the mount. (A pale colour makes the picture look larger; a dark colour makes the picture look smaller). Normally, a frame is sold in a long strip which needs to be cut to size.

You will also need:
* Glass
* Matt board
* Foam core
* Sealing tape
* Wood glue
* Pins for securing the backing to the frame
* Eyelets
* Nylon cord

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Editing Wikitext|bd=linen}}
{{thetop|bd=beige|ha1=center|cs=5px|fs2=1em|ff2=Arial,Sans-serif|cp3=0px 5px 5px 20px|bd2=ivory|cp2=10px|br2=3px solid lightgrey|__TOC__|&lt;h2&gt;Text Headings&lt;/h2&gt;
Formal heading styles are used in nearly all WikiBooks pages and for that matter, for all of the sister projects' pages as well.   They clearly show a degree of organization in the work, and they are absolutely essential if the user intends to take advantage of the automatically generated table of contents, (TOC).

The following notes explain how to make wiki headings, and introduces the table of contents.  Notes are provided on moving the TOC around, and constraining its behavior.   For those who intend to put the TOC into a table cell at the top of a page, refer to [[../Pictures/Images_in_Containers|Images in Containers]], and [[../Templates_Ready_to_Use|Templates Ready to Use]].|[[image:CourierWC.png|200px]]|trailer=&lt;br clear=all&gt;&amp;nbsp;}}
{{block|ta=left|ff=1em|background=linen|&lt;h2&gt;Heading levels&lt;/h2&gt;
There are six levels of heading styles and all of them are made by surrounding the heading text with an appropriate number of equals signs.   The HTML heading styles are equivalent and so optionally, the heading text can be surrounded by the HTML tags instead.   As an example; to make a level two heading, the largest practical heading, write either of the following at the left margin:

{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;==Heading Text==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;or;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heading Text&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

To make smaller headings just increase the number of equals signs, or use larger numbers in the HTML tags.   It was stated above that there are six levels but the first level is usually reserved for the page heading, and making a table of contents with more that three levels can be messy.   As a result it is most common to stick to levels two, three and four, or to use the HTML equivalent, h2, h3 and h4.   By insuring that smaller headings come below larger headings in the text, the TOC will indent the sub-levels accordingly, and automatically insert the required links. 

At times a heading is needed for text in a table.  Wikitext heading codes can have an adverse effect on tables and templates.   When this happens, changing to the HTML versions of the heading will often solve the problem.   

The level two heading style inserts a line across the page whether it is needed or not, but to add a similar line with the other headings, just type four hyphens at the left margin as follows:

{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;----&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

&amp;nbsp;}}
{{block|ta=left|background=floralwhite|ff=inherit|1=&lt;h2&gt;Summary of Headings&lt;/h2&gt;
The following table contains a summary of the headings that can be made.

&lt;table  border=0 align=center cellspacing=0 cellpadding=9px                       style=&quot;background:lightyellow;color:black;border:1px solid lightgrey;&quot;&gt;

 &lt;td style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black;&quot;&gt;
    '''h6''' is rarely used&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hiding Headings&lt;/h3&gt;
As was mentioned above, the headings are used to make the table of contents, (TOC).   Sometimes, when the TOC is looking a bit full, or when a heading does not seem to warrant listing, it would be useful to have the benefits of the heading's formats, but to miss it out on the TOC.

A set of templates has been made to do this.   They are the six templates [[Template:Hiddenh1|Hiddenh1]] through [[Template:Hiddenh6|Hiddenh6]].   The way to use say, a level three heading style without a TOC listing is just:
{{block|background=ivory|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{hiddenh3|Hidden Heading Here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Just choose a different template for other heading sizes.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;       


&lt;h3&gt;Numbered Headings&lt;/h3&gt;
Numbered headings are made only by typing them yourself, and the nested heading sizes are made in usual way. 

The conventional numbering method is to assign a separate number sequence to each level of heading.   Although an automatic method purports to exist in the user's preferences, it affects only the ''local'' view and will not be seen by others.   A fairly standard approach for numbered headings is seen below, but the indentation that is preferred for numbered sub-sections cannot be obtained with a simple use of tags or wiki code.   Templates could be made to indent the sub-sections properly, setting left margins for the paragraphs accordingly, and for those who might attempt it, the existing CSS styles for headings have been provided below.     

{{block|ff=inherit|ta=left|background=white|{{hiddenh2|1 Some Flowering Plants}}
{{hiddenh3|1.1 Monocots}}
{{hiddenh4|1.1.1 Orchids}}
{{hiddenh4|1.1.2 Onions}}

{{hiddenh2|2 Trees}}
etc.
}}      

&lt;h3&gt;Drop Capitals&lt;/h3&gt;
Drop capitals are used for work where heading styles are intrusive, though the rules for their use are by no means clear.

{{drop|T}}here is no drop capital code in Wikitext at this time, but a template exists.   The drop capital at the start of this paragraph was added using the [[template:drop|'''Drop''']] template.   Users who need a different drop capital can find the basic coding on the template's editing window.    The code used to call this template into use was just:
{{block|background=ivory|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Drop|T}}here is no drop capital...&lt;/nowiki&gt; }}    
Notice that only the first character of the paragraph was included within the double curly brackets, and that the remainder of the text was dressed tightly to the left.  


&amp;nbsp;}}
{{block|ta=left|background=lavenderblush|ff=inherit|&lt;h2&gt;The Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
The table of contents habitually resides at the top-left of the page.   In fact, it will position itself at the left margin and just above the first heading that is made.   The TOC lists all of the headings and makes links to their positions in the page.   Selecting a link causes the page to shift so that the selected heading is at the top of the screen.   A table of contents will not be generated unless at least four headings are made.

The width and length of the TOC adjusts as more heading text is added.   The width adjusts to the longest heading and the box extends downward as more headings are added.   At some point the text is wrapped rather than continuously widening the box.  The automatic behavior of the TOC is not always welcome, and various methods to constrain it have been devised.   See the comments below.

It is possible to remove the TOC by typing;
{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
anywhere on the page. (Note that there are ''two'' underscores on each side).   The usual Wiki page includes a table of contents, but it is unclear how strict the convention is.  Note the section above on ''Hiding Headings'' to avoid headings being added to the TOC.    

To ''include'' the TOC in a place that it would not normally appear, for example, in a table cell at say the top of the page, just type the following code in the cell as if it were text;
{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}                 
Such a method can be used to position the TOC with some accuracy, as well as running text or images level with it in the top section. The &lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; word overrides a previous &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; instruction though only one TOC can appear on a page.

The template [[template:tocright|'''Tocright''']] can be used to place a table of contents at the right side of the WikiBooks page.   The TOC will appear adjacent to the position on the page that the template is called.   To call the template into use just type;
{{block|background=ivory|ta=left|fs=1.1em|ff='Courier New',Courier,Monospace|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{tocright}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Other templates , that display the TOC with images and text at the top of a page include [[template:imageontop|'''Imageontop''']], [[template:Textontop|'''Textontop''']], and a number of similar templates.   Another table-based template for top-sections is [[template:thetop|'''Thetop''']], and the table of contents is easily be added to it, as can be seen in the top section of ''this'' page. 

The colors of the TOC are fixed; in fact they are set by the '''Toccolours''' class.   So far, the TOC itself has resisted any modification.

&lt;h2&gt;CSS Heading Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
At times, for example for templates, users need to know the details of certain wiki styles.   These can be found in the wikibooks style sheets.   An example of these styles for the main wiki headings can be found in the drop-box below.

'''SQL/400''' is a proprietary dialect of SQL for the IBM AS/400, which was later rebranded as iSeries and finally as SystemI, business eServer Computer Platform.  It comes in several flavors, or ways that SQL can be run.

* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#Interactive_SQL.2F400 Interactive SQL/400] which can be run from the Command line.  Invoke STRSQL {Start SQL/400} and get at what looks like another command line, where we can key in SQL statements for immediate execution, and/or use the F4 Prompt function to navigate IBM DB2/400 data base, which is a version of UDB, IBM's Universal Data Base to get at the 400'ds files (tables) and their fields (columns), for incorporation in the SQL statement. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#Interactive_SQL.2F400 Interactive SQL/400] is often used to identify statements needed to perform various programming actions.  When exiting an Interactive SQL/400 session, we have the option of saving a log of our activity, from which our successful SQL/400 statements may be copied into one of the other flavors of SQL/400. 
*SQL Query Manager is used to design and store SQL queries used to extract information, generate reports, and create procedures.  Query Manager is an interface to SQL in which end users, unfamiliar with SQL, the programming language, can be prompted through what is needed to create inquiries and reports that are more sophisticated than what can be created by other tools, and can be rerun as needed.
* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#Static_Embedded_SQL Static Embedded SQL] involves SQL statements hard coded inside another high level language program, such as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#SQL_embedded_in_RPG RPG/400],  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#SQL_embedded_in_Cobol Cobol/400], C/400, and REXX.  This is done because there are some areas where SQL is more powerful than other languages, but there are some things they can do that SQL can not.  See Comparative Computer Languages.  So the AS/400 programmer can pick and choose the Computer Language that is best suited to the needed function, with programs in different languages calling code in other languages a variety of ways.
*Dynamic Embedded SQL 
All the AS/400 languages that support [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL/400#Static_Embedded_SQL Static Embedded SQL] also support Dynamic Embedded SQL. 
*Other SQL/400 Applications.  Suppose you connect to the AS/400 using a Personal Computer which has many PC Applications, such as Microsoft Excel.  You can put SQL statements inside an Excel cell which will access the AS/400 data base.  When you open the Excel, it immediately shows you the latest data from the data base.  You can then change the statements to change what data is selected for the Excel.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
== Interactive SQL/400 ==

== SQL Query Manager ==
== Languages that support Embedded SQL ==
* C/400
* Cobol/400
* RPG (many different versions of RPG on the 400)
* REXX
* PL/1
* Fortran/400

== Static Embedded SQL ==

Static Embedded SQL statments are written into the source code of the high level language program, then an SQL Precompiler converts the SQL statements to a form that is acceptable to the high level language compiler.  

Dynamic SQL Statements are composed, prepared and run when the program is run.

=== SQL embedded in RPG ===
SQL statements can be placed within the calculations of an RPG program ... detail calculations, total calculations, or an RPG Subroutine.  RPG identifies what section of a program, using a character in position 6 with a C for calculations.  Here is how SQL statements are usually embedded in RPG program calculations.

  C/EXEC SQL
  C+ SQL Statement
  C+ SQL Statement
  C+ SQL Statement...
  C/END-EXEC

There can be any number of SQL Statements.  Notice the slash at beginning of the first and last lines, that delineate the beginning and end of the SQL statements embedded in the RPG code.  Notice the plus sign at the beginning of each SQL statement.

Conventional RPG uses files which are to be specified in F-spec of the program code. SQL statements can have files which may not be specified in F-spec of the program code.

Beginning with Release V5R4 embedded SQL can be used in (RPG) free format notation either. An embedded SQL statement starts with EXEC SQL which can be positioned at any place between postion 8 and 80. The SQL statement can be coded immediately after the EXEC SQL but also can start in the next row. The SQL statement can be splitted into multiple rows, but must be specified between positon 8 and 80. An embedded SQL statement in free format ends like any other free format RPG statement with a semi colon (;)

 /Free
     Exec SQL  SQL Statement;

     Exec SQL  
       SQL Statement;

     Exec SQL  SQL Statement 1st Row
       SQL Statement 2nd Row
       ...
       SQL Statement nth Row;

Example:
  /Free
     Exec SQL  Select Coalesce(Max(OrdPos) + 1, 1) into :NewPos
                  From OrderPosition
                  Where OrderNo = :ParOrderNo;

=== SQL embedded in Cobol ===

In Cobol, SQL statements are embedded in specific program sections.  The END-EXEC must be terminated with a period.

 EXEC SQL
   SQL Statement
   SQL Statement
 END-EXEC.

There can be any number of SQL statements.

=== Static SQL SELECT Modes ===
Static SQL offers two modes of operation, with secondary options.
* SELECT one row of a table, at a time.
* SELECT multiple rows of one or more tables into a Cursor.
** A Serial Cursor is when each row of the results is to be fetched only once per open of the cursor, going through the data sequentially.  Each time a row of data is read into the program, the cursor is moved to the next row of the result table.  This is repeated until reaching end-of-data, when the cursor should be closed.  To use the cursor again, close the current use of it, then re-issue the open statement.  We cannot back up in a Serial Cursor.
** A Scroll Cursor supports alternatives to going through the data sequentially.  Access defaults to the Serial Cursor method, while the Fetch statement can position the cursor where to do the reading.  When it is not specified that the Scroll Cursor is Dynamic, access is read-only.  This kind of Cursor is usually in a program to display parts of the data base on screen of end user, who can then key in something to navigate the data, leading the Scroll Cursor to be positioned elsewhere in the data, to get what the user wants to see.
** A Dynamic Scroll Cursor permits the update of rows that are accessed.

==== SQL Cursor ====
There are several ways this can be programmed.  One way is to define a Data Structure which defines all the data elements that will be selected with each occurrence of executing the multiple rows.  It reads in the data from the joined files very similar to reading a record from one file in RPG or Cobol.

Unlike many other AS/400 programming languages, where Variables can be defined wherever needed, such at the beginning of some Subroutine that will be using them, SQL/400 requires that anything, to be used in the program, where the SQL is embedded, be defined earlier in the program source code than where ever it is subsequently used.  Thus, the sequence of processing an SQL cursor, embedded in another high level language, is:
# Declare Cursor
# Open Cursor
# Fetch Rows using Select
# Optionally Delete or Update
# Close Cursor

== Dynamic Embedded SQL ==
select *
from table.campo, table1.campo1
where table.campo = table1.campo1

== Other SQL/400 Applications ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Phoenix Hacker. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Phoenix Hacker~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called KevinBaker. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name KevinBaker~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

I live in Cape Town, South Africa, and yes, I'm the same Greenman from the [http://en.wikipedia.org English] wikipedia, as well as who tinkers with the [http://af.wikipedia.org Afrikaans wikipedia], hopefully without causing too much damage.

I'm very keen to see Wikipedia's in the other South African languages - anyone who can help please contact me.

You can get a pretty good idea of my interests by looking at the articles to which I've contributed - mostly South African interest. 

I also have a [[http://www.greenman.co.za/b2evolution/blogs/index.php a blog]].

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Garglebutt. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Garglebutt~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Financial status is generally viewed with four basic quadrants. 
# Income
# Expense (Spending)
# Assets 
# Liabilities

One have to manage these four quadrants in a way that he/she can survive today and also in future (ie after retirement) The way one manages these four quadrants

== Liabilities ==

This module reviews liabilities in your life. Liabilities by definition generates an expense (or spending). As you might see from the following list these are cause of the out flow of money.

:[[/Loans/]]
:[[/Credit Cards/]]

== Saving ==

Saving in view of personal finance is more of the discipline. Small amount of money saved regularly can build bigger kitty. This is because of compounding interest. The earlier you start to save, the more interest your money will gain over time if you dont touch your savings. In general savings can be classified by the purpose for which it is done.

First purpose of saving is for saving rainy day. Based on the individual he/she needs to identify the amount which will be needed on short notice in case of emergency. This saving amount must be available in a bank account in such a way that you can withdraw at your will. Once you are saving beyond this amount it must become part of your investment. Second purpose for saving is that once you retire, the person has hopefully saved enough money to live on. The third purpose of saving is to leave a legacy to a family member or a friend. A legacy is where a person saves up money and when they die, the money goes to the family member. 
 
:[[/Tax Advantaged Savings/]]
:[[/Automatic Savings/]]
:[[/Paying Debt/]]

== Investing  ==
{{see also|Investing}}

Investing involves using your money (or borrowed money that you control) to earn more money. Investments are classified based on the risk and return matrix. 
Most people base their investments on how soon they expect to retire, how long they want that money to last, and how they want to live after they retire. The average retired person that has money invested plans on really never touching the money invested but rather living off the interest their money is making them. For example if a person is retired and wants to live off $50,000 for the rest of their life, they might have 1 million dollars invested trying to earn 5% on the investments. That way at the end of the year they have made 50,000 which can be withdrew and they still have that 1 million dollars invested.

Following are the possible categories :

High Risk = High Return
   This formula is stating that a person that is willing to invest in riskier assets expects a higher return on those assets. A good example of high risk investments are:
Single stocks
Small cap stocks
Large cap stocks
Volatile stocks 

Low Risk = Low Return
   This formula is showing that a person that want to have safe guaranteed investments show expect a low return. People that usually invest in safer options tend not to trust the market and have considerable doubts. 
Examples of low risk options are:
Mutual funds (diversified with stock and bonds)
Treasury bills
Triple A rated bonds


In general one should be able to put their investment in above two class. A person doesn't want to put all of their money into investments. Most people want a safety net so they should keep a certain percent of their money in cash. The best thing an investor can do for retirement planning is to diversify their portfolio (dont put all your eggs in one basket). Diversifying a portfolio makes is less risky to the investor but can still have a decent return. This is because the investor can expect the total percentage of your portfolio not to change has much as one stock alone. 

Ratio in which one's investment should be distributed between the two categories is based on the person's risk appetite. One's risk apatite can be a function of age and total assets. If a person is younger, he/she can invest more in riskier avenues since he/she can recover from the loss. If the person already has very high assets he can increase his/her exposure to the riskier investments to gain more returns. If a person is already retired, they might want to consider investing in safe investments that produce a low guaranteed income because they dont have any other source of income coming in so they wont want to take the chance on losing it.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called BarnacleKB. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name BarnacleKB~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

This is just an attempt to shift the more generalized areas of ''[[../A critique of Wikibooks|A critique of Wikibooks]]'' into a separate document. The word 'wiki' in the title should be considered synonymous with 'MediaWiki'. I may include other wiki systems over time.

== Abstract ==

MediaWiki is a recent and popular implementation of the 'mind-map' concept. I've seen this as far back at the late 1980s, designed for use either as a personal database, or a means of explaining language. The success of the internet means this can now be done collaboratively with people from all over the world, but this introduces new problems.

With a single user editing the whole thing, they can use whatever terminology they desire, but when working with such systems collaboratively, shared language must be agreed upon. This is, in effect, the system-wide NPOV policy, which is arguably the only policy you really need. The effect of applying this policy to the definitions of words and concepts you might find in Wikipedia, you end up having no choice but to agreed to shared language.

== Q&amp;A ==

; What are the problems with the use of language?

* Obvious things like the existence of many incompatible languages and dialects thereof.

These have mostly been addressed by splitting wikis into language codes, but even within a single language code, many dialects exist. q.v. dispute on UK/US English, amongst various other arguments on [[m:Requests for new languages]]. When is a dialect considered unique enough to warrant its own language code?

* Other problems with both written and spoken language

e.g. category logic errors, metaphor vs practical definition, meaningful statements.

Note that the use-mention distinction has already been pointed out somewhere in [[w:WP:MOS]]. In fact, this may already contain many solutions.

* Intonation in spoken language

The practise of changing one's tone of voice when saying something, to hint at an alternate interpretation of what they are saying, doesn't translate well when written. I notice a lot of subtitled TV shows use the tokens '(!)' and '(?)' at the end of a sentence to imply a 'sarcastic' tone.

* Body language

i.e. actually doing something rather than talking about something

The ultimate language, which if taken 'literally' lacks any ambiguity, although this is probably beyond the scope of a wiki.

; Could a natural language ever evolve into the use of fully discrete concepts?

By which I mean, all ambiguity is removed.

Modern high-level computer programming languages are not far off, since they effectively let you define your own language of 'identifiers' to keep it meaningful. Low-level languages that use numbers to represent operations and data (verbs and nouns) might be more accurate.

I don't think this type conversation will ever become commonplace:

 Fred: 287 10 1879?
 Bob: 3!

That is to imply that each number represents a fully discrete concept, although many geek-conversations do approach this level of disambiguation.

; What are the conceptual differences between nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc?

It seems you can translate between them quite easily. Might be worth investigating [[w:Lojban]] to see what they came up with.

; Are there examples of natural languages which do not have these distinctions?

I'm wondering about pictographic languages like the Kanji. Need to check this out.

Also, languages of other life-forms. Body language?

; What exactly is the canonical mapping of English words to their referent?

e.g. OED, Brittanica, etc.

I use the term 'dictionary' to include 'encyclopedia'.

But what happens when competing dictionaries disagree, or provide alternate meanings that others do not? How can a paper dictionary ever be future-proof? Is an evolving dictionary like Wikipedia the only solution?

; Are all the Mediawiki wikis actually trying to achieve the same thing in a different way?

e.g. scope overlap with Wiktionary/Wikipedia/Wikibooks

; What words are dangerous?

An argument from [[w:Talk:Words to avoid]] even suggests that the verb 'to be' is dangerous, since it argues that other verbs are almost always more accurate. This may be true, but it's such a common verb, it's not practical to simply stop using it. Perhaps its meaning just needs to be tightened up. e.g.

* X am/are/is Y

If 'X' and 'Y' represent concepts invented by people, which are generally well-defined to be objectively distinguisable regarding their accuracy. q.v. boolean algebra, set theory, etc.

If 'X' and 'Y' are, instead, commonly used words to represent philosophically undefinable concepts (e.g. truth, morality, etc.)

There ought to be some sort of measure of meaningfulness, based on how many other concepts are required to understand in order to understand it. q.v. concrete nouns.

* Is X Y?

Again, depends on X and Y, but does this really mean:

* Please define X in terms of Y, or Y in terms of X.

; Should self-contradictory words be deprecated?

For example: the word 'atom', literally means 'indivisible'. Popularly, it means one of those things physicists keep banging on about, but those are not indivisible (metaphorically speaking, I guess). Therefore, just by using the word 'atom' in the latter sense, are you implicitly (and erroneously) saying that an atom is atomic? The flip side of this is you can quite correctly say &quot;an atom is not atomic&quot;. Does it strike anyone that this might be somewhat confusing from a typographical perspective? Do we have some subconscious desire to deliberately obfuscate our language?

== Completely unfounded assertions ==

For want of a better place for now.

; The Wikimedia projects should define the MediaWiki software, not vice versa.

This is probably already true, but having investigated the latest betas of Mediawiki, I feel a case of [[w:feeping creaturism]] coming on shortly. I guess the project can cope, since it runs more off wetware than software.

; Need better distinction between words and concepts.

Wikipedia has already bumped into this problem, and created disambiguation pages to solve it. I suspect in many cases of words and word-phrases, a disambiguation page is not necessary, but as the amount of discrete concepts increase on Wikipedia, so will its ambiguity.

Why couldn't a wiki contain a master index of concepts, then attach the various typographic and phonetic language 'codes' (i.e. written and spoken words) commonly used to refer to each concept. Problem is that in order to define the concepts, you need some language in which to do so. I guess real-life photos, sound-samples and other sensory cues could be substituted for text where possible, since they arguably provide more meaning than text in any case.

I argue that this is the only goal of language. It would seem that almost everyone agrees on the concepts of the universe, but merely argue about the language used to refer to them, and the boundaries of the conceptual cases that they cover. For example, the concept generally referred to by the word &quot;God&quot; could perhaps also be referred to by the words &quot;the laws of physics&quot;, in that they both refer to a conceptual entity which is allegedly responsible for the creation of the universe. Does this mean that the two phrases may be used interchangably? Perhaps not, since the &quot;God&quot; concept implies something of a vaguely humanoid form, but if I apply this to the first sentence of the Old Testament (UK edition), I end up with:

* In the beginning when the laws of physics created the universe, the earth was formless and desolate.

A physicist might argue that the earth did not exist at the beginnings of the universe, but I suppose the word &quot;when&quot; in that sentence could be reasonably argued not to read as &quot;at the exact instant that&quot;, but rather &quot;during the period when&quot;. Point is, it's arguably correct.

What if a physics student studying gravity was asked by student of religion:

* What did you learn about today?

Allowing for a certain amount of metaphor, could he, in all honesty, reply:

* And the Lord spake, &quot;what goes up must come down&quot;.

Is this merely a translation of the same concepts into a different dialect of the English language?</text>

== About This Book ==
This book will cover the composition of music in the digital domain, from the basic concepts behind synthesizers and sequencers to production techniques such as mixing, mastering and signal processing. The reader is assumed to have some knowledge of music, and at least a passing familiarity with computers, but is just learning to put the two together.

Specific examples will make use of [[w:Free software|Free software]] running on a [[w:Linux|Linux]]-based operating system. All the packages mentioned should be available in the standard repositories for [[w:Debian|Debian]] and its derivatives, such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint. You should be able to find and install them by name using a GUI package manager such as [[w:Synaptic (software)|Synaptic]].

=== Related Wikibooks ===
I found a couple of other wikibooks on related subjects. As of this writing, they are in a very unfinished state and appear to have been inactive for some years:
* [[Sound Synthesis Theory]] — just a few pages.
* [[Sound in the Digital Domain]] — just one page.
Some of the material from these could be reused here.

=== Linux Information ===
For those needing help with basic sound setup on Linux, the wiki at [http://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/start linuxaudio.org] seems like the best source of information. Other useful links are available on [http://en.flossmanuals.net/ardour/ch011_advanced-linux-configuration/ this page] of the Ardour tutorial. And the Fedora Project [http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Musicians_Guide/index.html Musicians’ Guide] looks very useful as well.

There are some related wikibooks here on wikibooks.org, but they all seem rather incomplete:
* Sound specifics:
** [[Configuring Sound on Linux]]
** [[Linux Audio: A Guide For Beginner and Beyond]]
* More general Linux information:
** [[Linux Guide]]
** [[Using Ubuntu Linux]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Is Digital Music?==

In the context of this book, [[w:Digital|digital]] music refers to music made using digital hardware or software, typically with a computer workstation.

If you have heard music produced while you were alive, you have almost certainly heard music that has been produced digitally. Music in the digital domain is often associated with [[w:Electronic music|electronic music]]; however this is not always the case. The foundation of electronic music is based on work done in the [[w:Analogue Electronics|analog]] domain, from analog [[w:Synthesizer|synthesizers]] to [[w:Tape loop|tape loop manipulation]]. These techniques are still popular today, even though computer-based [[w:Sequencer|sequencing]] and [[w:Digital Signal Processing|sound modification]] / [[w:Synthesis|generation]] are industry standard. Computers are, however, regularly used to produce digital equivalents of analog instruments and effects, making the distinction increasingly less important.

==Audio Versus Control==
It is important to understand the distinction between two kinds of computer music data: ''audio samples'' and ''control data''. Audio samples are direct digital representations of sound that you can actually hear, while control data consists of a sequence of commands, typically on a note-by-note level, that can be obeyed by a suitably-designed music instrument or other sound-production device. Working directly with audio gives you, in principle the greatest freedom to perform complicated transformations on the samples to produce sounds that no one has heard before.

But certain kinds of processing are easier with the control data; for example, feeding the same sequence of note commands to a different instrument, or to the same instrument with different settings, can produce an entirely different-sounding rendition of the same tune, without the need for a lot of processing. It is easy to speed up or slow down the tempo of the piece, simply by adjusting the timing of the notes; this can be done independently of changing the key of the piece by transposing all the notes up or down by a constant interval. Working with audio data, it is harder to apply these two effects separately; speeding up/slowing down the tempo also tends to raise/lower the pitch, unless you apply a lot of complicated processing of the sound.

By far the most common kind of control data system you will come across is called [[w:MIDI|MIDI]], which is short for ''Musical Instrument Digital Interface''. Its usage is so firmly established that even music software applications running on a computer with no actual MIDI interfaces will still communicate with each other as though they were connected via MIDI. Standardization is a Good Thing.

===Audio Files Versus MIDI Files===
Corresponding to the two different kinds of music-related computer data, there are two families of file formats for holding the data. Files for holding audio samples tend to be separate from those for holding MIDI data; the only kinds of files that can hold both tend to be specific to particular music applications, and not common formats.

There is a variety of audio formats, such as [[w:Wav|.WAV]], [[w:FLAC|FLAC]], [[w:MP3|MP3]], Ogg [[w:Vorbis|Vorbis]] and of course the whole range of movie formats that include both video and audio tracks. For our purposes, the important question is whether the format is ''compressed'' or ''uncompressed'', and particularly, if it is compressed, whether the compression is ''lossy'' or not. Lossy compression throws away information that the listener cannot hear, based on well-established ''psychoacoustic'' models of how human hearing works. Unfortunately, while this may be fine for a final delivery format, it is not good for an initial audio recording format, because it severely limits the kinds of processing you can perform. For example, you cannot use filtering to emphasize less-audible sounds if the audio encoding has already got rid of them! Thus, for raw audio capture, we want raw, uncompressed formats, or failing that, losslessly-compressed formats.

For MIDI, on the other hand, there is just one [[w:MIDI#Standard_MIDI_files|Standard MIDI File]] format. Thank goodness.

==Brief History==

Synthesized instruments began to appear relatively soon after music became [[w:Sound recording|recorded]], in the early 20th century. The exact technology used varied, but the primary lesson to learn is that they used an [[w:Oscillator|oscillator]] to generate a tone at varying frequencies. Amplitude, when mapped out as a function of time, produce a [[w:Waveform|waveform]] that tells a speaker what point to be at at a given instance. What an oscillator does is produce an indefinitely repeatable pattern that can be directed to the speaker. Through the combination of multiple oscillators, distortions of the waveform, and other techniques, unique sounds may be produced.

Digital techology works with [[w:Binary|bits]], which have only a &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; state. So, to represent the waveform in computer memory, the waveform is divided into discrete [[w:Sampling|samples]], where each sample represents the amplitude of the waveform at a given moment in time. Sound streams use many bits for each of these variables, to achieve a very fine precision in the waveform's representation. Digitalization means that audible artifacts can appear if care is not taken to keep the sound at the highest level of precision possible, and a poor conversion to analog(which often occurs on computers with low-cost integrated sound) will always make what comes through the speakers sound weak and &quot;tinny&quot;.

Early synthesizers had no standardized control mechanism; this led to problems and additional hassle in the studio. But after the advent of the [[w:MIDI|MIDI]] standard in the 1980s, control was greatly simplified. MIDI is a digital protocol that allows one machine(such as a piano keyboard, or a computer) to control another over a cable, triggering the other machine's events. At first, that meant a hardware synthesizer, but much of the hardware used when MIDI was invented has been reduced to software versions today. MIDI files are simply sequences of MIDI events using the &quot;General MIDI&quot; (GM) standard instruments, whose actual sounds are up to interpretation by the playback mechanism; their derision by many is the result of GM's limitations. MIDI is showing its age today, but is still a commonplace and useful tool.

[[w:Sampler|Samplers]] also appeared in the 1980s. These machines store recordings and play them back; the difference between them and tape recorders are that samplers allow for great variation in the manner of playback. Digital technology makes effects such as reversing, looping, instantaneous restarting, and variable playback speed easy to accomplish. Modern computer sound cards work like a sampler that the computer can control and feed data to on-the-fly. The first sampling computer was the Commodore Amiga, released in 1985. From this computer, [[w:Tracker|tracking]] was born, introducing digital music composition to the home consumer and started a new generation of musicians and genres.

== MIDI Basics ==
As should be apparent from above, MIDI is a rather important part of digital music production, so it helps to have a basic idea of what it is.

As mentioned above, MIDI is a sequence of ''commands'' to make sound, as opposed to representing actual sound itself. The main part of it is ''note-on'' and ''note-off'' commands: for a keyboard instrument, these represent keys being pressed and released, for a plucked string instrument, they would be the plucking and muting of strings, for wind instruments, the starting and stopping of blowing a note, and so on. Associated with each note command is a ''channel'', which can have a number from 1 to 16, and a ''velocity'', which might represent how hard the key is hit or the string is plucked, and is usually supposed to affect the loudness of the note (though this can depend on the instrument configuration). Different instruments receiving the same stream of MIDI commands could be configured to only listen to specific channel numbers, or a single instrument could be set up to produce different sounds on different channels at once; either way, you can play a whole set of instrument parts from a single MIDI command stream.

Of course, 16 channels isn’t a lot—perhaps sufficient to emulate a small band, not for an entire orchestra. This small number reflects the limitations of digital technology in the early 1980s, when MIDI was first formulated. However, there are ways around this, for example by running multiple concurrent MIDI streams, each driving a different set of instruments. This is not hard to do on a modern computer. Thus, in such ways, the venerable MIDI standard continues to remain useful, to the point where no proposal for a successor has managed to gain much support.

Besides note commands, there are also ''control-change'' commands to set values for ''controllers'' on each channel (e.g. vibrato depth and speed), and ''program-change'' commands to choose the instrument for each channel. There are also non-channel-specific messages, of which the most important is “all notes off”—very useful if, for some reason (software bug, congestion on the MIDI connection or whatever), you have managed to send a bunch of note-on commands without corresponding notes-off; sequencer programs will often have a “Panic” button which, when clicked, sends this command and silences the cacophony!

There is also a set of “system-exclusive” commands (commonly abbreviated “SysEx”), the meanings of which are up to the makers of the instruments. These could be used to set up the full range of synthesizer parameters, or even load actual sound data into the synthesizer.

== Chess problems ==

Before I do exponential amouts of damage to the [[Puzzles:Chess problems|Chess problems]] section, what do you think a &quot;non-pathologically meaningless title&quot; for [[Puzzles:Chess_problems:Chess_directmates:Fourteen-move_chess_directmate_1]] and similar pages in that section be? --[[User:Borbrav|Borbrav]] 20:08, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

: That title isn't too bad by itself, though I'd be inclined to make it a little less redundant.  Maybe [[Puzzles:Chess problems:Directmates:Fourteen-move directmate 1]].  Hmm.... -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 10:30, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

: I see you've started moving them around a bit.  Just a small suggestion: I tend to do it top-down.  That is, first move section pages, starting with those at the highest level, before moving the individual puzzle and solution pages within them.  That way, it will be quick and easy to update the navigation header while at each one.  True, there are also links from the section pages to the puzzles to update, but updating these later will be a little easier as there are fewer pages to update them on. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 16:54, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Borbrav. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Borbrav~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Omelet ==

It's a valid spelling, just as grey and gray are both valid spellings.

I rather like using a mix of spellings just to drive home the point.

Especially in terms like &quot;Denver omelet&quot; and &quot;Spanish omelet&quot;, the simple
spelling is the norm.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:43, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

: I'm inclined to agree with you. I suppose the page titles should always have redirects, one way or the other, and the choice of spelling in the text can on the whim of the author. As a rule of thumb I think that recipes that have a clear French origin (like the French omelette and Omelette du whatever) should use omelette, and recipes that don't have anything to do with France (Denver, Spanish, Japanese, Fritatta) should use omelet.

== [[meta:Wikibooks/Logo]] ==

Hello Risk, how are you? I saw your Wikijunior logo submission, and I really like it a lot! For some reason, not maky people are submitting logos for Wikijunior, at least not as many as for Wikibooks. Are you planning on submitting a Wikibooks logo as well?

One thing that people were trying to avoid is different language projects from using different wording on the logo itself. If there is no text on the logo, there is no need for it to be localized for each project, which in turn can produce better cohesion between the various language projects. Would you mind uploading a version of your logo with no text on it? I dont know how uptight people are going to be about the text issue, but I would hate to see your great design lose because of that detail. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:37, 15 December 2007 (UTC)
: Thank you, I'm glad you like it. I am thinking about submitting a design for wikibooks, but I'm little busy at the moment. That's also the reason I just submitted something I hacked together in photoshop, instead of taking the time to redo it properly in SVG. If I can find some time, I'll redo the logo in SVG and try to make a version without text. [[User:Risk|risk]] ([[User talk:Risk|talk]]) 15:39, 19 December 2007 (UTC)
::Definitely take your time. We have not specified an end to the logo submission stage yet (i would like it to continue for another month or two at least). Also, while the final logo must be SVG, there is no reason why the logos in this stage must be in that format. We can always convert them as the process moves forward. Good luck on being busy, and I hope to see your Wikibooks submission! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:53, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

== [[Template:SeasonalitySpec]] ==

Hi Risk,

I just did some changes on [[Template:Seasonality]] that merge the functionality of [[Template:SeasonalitySpec]] into it. The latter isn't used anywhere. Do you think there is a use for a separate template? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:39, 12 December 2008 (UTC)
: Hi, nice work. I guess I wasn't aware of default arguments in mediawiki templates when I made those. You're right that SeasonalitySpec can be deleted now. There may be a reference to it on one of the cookbook pages on how to use the templates. That'll need to be updated. [[User:Risk|risk]] ([[User talk:Risk|talk]]) 22:11, 15 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

* Audacity
* Modplug Tracker (or another tracker program)

== Make a sound ==

# Open Audacity.
# Generate &quot;Silence&quot; so you have something to start with.
# Change the view to &quot;Samples.&quot; You can see how many samples make up the waveform on the lower status bar by rolling over the end of the waveform.  Note: if you are having trouble doing this, go to the View menu, then Set Selection Format to &quot;samples (snap to samples)&quot;.  The number of samples you have selected will be displayed in the lower status bar.
# Cut down most of the silence. Zoom in.
# Repeat until you've cut the number of samples down to a power of 2 (64, 128, and 256 are good values.)
# Now select the &quot;Draw&quot; tool.
# Paint something with the mouse on the silence. A smooth, slow curve will sound &quot;hollow&quot; while a jumpy, irregular pattern will sound &quot;noisy.&quot;
# Make sure your sound is on, but keep it turned low for the next part.  (This is so that if your sound wave sounds particularly unpleasant, your ears will be spared.)
# Shift-click on the Play button to loop-play your sound.
#. Save it when you're happy with it.

== Import the sound ==

# Open Modplug.
# Click the Samples tab.
# &quot;Open&quot; your sound.
# Turn on &quot;Loop&quot; and set the loop length to the size of your sound.
# Your sound's ready for use; now you can enter the tracker.

== A combination of {{tl|Test}} and {{tl|joinus}} ==

While not strictly necessary I think it would be a good idea to have a &quot;less harsh&quot; version of {{tl|Test}} that is somewhat combined with {{tl|joinus}}. It would be targeted at anons that make a single sandbox-type edit. It should be fairly short, containing at a minimum:
*A suggestion that they register
*A link/description to the sandbox
*A ''brief'' statement outlining the facts that yes, you can edit the page, and this is considered disruptive, but you're not in trouble (which is what {{tl|Test}} seems to convey) as long as you make constructive edits.
That might be a bit much to keep brief but I think if it's short and to the point and clear that they can 'redeem' themselves in a way might get us some useful contributors out of people doing random testing. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 09:24, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

{{msg:GeneralChemTOC}}

Current accounts of atomic structure are the result of centuries of contemplation and experimentation.  What follows is a very brief history of the development of atomic theory.

==Early Propositions==

===Atoms according to Democritus===
The earliest known proponent of anything resembling modern atomic theory was the ancient Greek thinker Democritus. He proposed the existence of indivisible atoms as a response to the arguments of Parmenides, and the paradoxes of Zeno.

Parmenides argued against the possibility of movement, change, and plurality on the premise that something cannot come from nothing.  Zeno attempted to prove Parmenides' point by a series of paradoxes based on difficulties with infinite divisibility.

In response to these ideas, Democritus posited the existence of indestructible atoms that exist in a void.  Their indestructibility provided a retort to Zeno, and the void allowed him to account for plurality, change, and movement.  It remained for him to account for the properties of atoms, and how they related to our experiences of objects in the world.

Democritus proposed that atoms possessed few actual properties, with size, shape, and mass being the most important.  All other properties, he argued, could be explained in terms of the three primary properties.  A smooth substance, for instance, might be composed of primarily smooth atoms, while a sour substance is composed of rough or sharp ones.  Solid substances might be composed of atoms with numerous hooks, by which they connect to each other, while the atoms of liquid substances possess far fewer points of connection.

===Alchemy===
Aristotle proposed that there were four elements, air, earth, water, and fire and that everything else was a mixture of these. This belief was very popular in the medieval ages and introduced the science of alchemy. Alchemy was based on the belief that since everything was made of only four elements, you could transmute mixtures into other mixtures of the same type, the most famous of which being lead into gold. 

Alchemy's problem was exposed by Antoine Lavoisier when he heated metallic tin in a sealed flask. A grayish ash appeared on the surface of the melting tin, which Lavoisier heated until no more ash formed. After the flask cooled, he inverted it and opened it underwater. He discovered the water rose one-fifth of the way into the glass, leading Lavoisier to conclude that air itself is a mixture, with one-fifth of it having combined with the tin, yet the other four-fifths did not, showing that air was not an element.

Lavoisier repeated the experiment again, substituting mercury for tin, and found that the same happened. Yet after heating gently, found that the ash released the air, showing that the experiment could be reversed. He concluded that the ash was a compound of the metal and oxygen, which he proved by weighing the metal and the ash, and showing that it was heavier than the original metal.

Lavoisier then stated that combustion was not an element, but instead was a chemical reaction of a fuel and oxygen.

==Dalton's Atomic Theory==
Holes in alchemy led the British chemist [[w:John Dalton|John Dalton]] to revive the atomic theory of matter. Dalton's atomic theory from about 1803 is the basis of today's chemistry, this theory consists of five parts:
#All matter is composed of atoms.
#An element is a type of matter always composed of only one kind of atom, which retains certain specific properties.
#Atoms can not be created or destroyed
#A compound is matter composed of two or more atoms of two or more elements chemically combined in specific ratios.
#A chemical reaction is the rearrangement of atoms to form new compounds.

==Thomson and the Discovery of the Electron==
In the year 1889 the British physicist [[w:J.J. Thomson|J.J. Thomson]] discovered the electron.  Thomson conducted a number of experiments using cathode rays.  Cathode rays are constructed by sealing two electrodes in a glass tube and removing the air from it.  When the electrodes are attached to high voltage, a beam of radiation is emitted from the negative electrode.  These beams are called cathode rays.

Thomson discovered that cathode rays travel in straight lines except when they are bent by electric or magnetic fields.  Because the cathode rays bent away from a negatively charged plate, Thomson concluded that these rays are made of negatively charged particles; today we call them electrons.  Thomson found that he could produce cathode rays using electrodes of various materials.  He then concluded that electrons were found in all atoms.

==The &quot;Plum Pudding&quot; Model of the Atom==
Soon after the discovery of the electron, Thomson began speculating on the nature of the atom.  He suggested a &quot;plum pudding&quot; model.  In this model the bits of &quot;plum&quot; were the electrons which were floating around in a &quot;pudding&quot; of positive charge to match that of the electrons and make an electrically neutral atom (a modern illustration of this idea would be a chocolate chip cookie, with the chips representing negatively charged electrons and the dough representing positive charge).

==Rutherford's Nuclear Atom==
Ernest Rutherford proved Thomson wrong through further experimentation and another theory in 1911. In his experiments Rutherford used alpha particles from a radioactive element such as radium.  Rutherford aimed the alpha particles at metal foils.  He found that most of the particles passed directly through the foil; however some were deflected nearly backward.

According to the plum pudding model all of the particles should have slowed as they passed through the &quot;pudding&quot; but none should have been deflected. Rutherford then concluded that every particle must have a nucleus, that is, a small hard positively charged core which takes up little space but contains the majority of the atom's mass. According to Rutherford's model the positively charged nucleus would attract the negatively charged electrons. Today we recognize that the atom consists of a positively charged core with a number of electrons moving around it.

I'm glad to see that this is progressing slowly and steadily.  Thank you for continuing to improve Wikibooks.  You might want to address the question raised on [[Talk:EverQuest]].  I'll help with the infrastructure work, such as transwikification, and with copy editing but I defer to those with the expertise on matters of content.  You might be able to encourage that other editor to contribute as well. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 03:44:11, 2005-08-23 (UTC)

Thank you Uncle G :) especially for the offer, to help with transwiki/reformatting... am still learning...--[[User:Kajolus|Kajolus]] 10:59, September 8, 2005 (UTC)

Heh, I'm not speedy, just had a few hours to devote to EQ without access to EQ. I'll go in spurts. You've done a good job setting this up. [[User:Tendiin|Tendiin]] 10:10, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
:same here really. sometimes I do have a bit of time at hand, which I would gladly devote to the wikibook. especially, as there are quite a few EQ related sites either disappearing, or not being updated anymore, or being sold to IGE/ZAM/Yantis or combinations... :-/ and thank you. yes, we did well so far, but I also believe, that we can do better. the cleaning up of the FAQ section was a great example, that 4 eyes see more than 2...--[[User:Kajolus|Kajolus]] 15:40, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

::Hmm, the main EQ page has transwikified.... I didn't see any discussion of it... and of course the time I was able to spend on the work was during coffee and lunch, at work, through a firewall that disallows my access to the stratwiki or whatever it is. Guess that is it for me. [[User:Tendiin|Tendiin]] 11:41, 11 May 2006 (UTC)
:::darn...here a quote from the new discussion page I just posted a few mins ago ''&quot;what surprised me though was, that I wasn't aware of the change (did I miss something here?). was there an announcement? I always though that things like that should at least be announced on the discussion page i.e. (no vote necessary really from my PoV, but not even an annnouncement?).&quot;'' now, that I see your post here, it seems, I am not the only one who didn't see it coming... I will ask the guys over on the strat. wiki... :-( what makes me kind of sad is, that finally there seems somebody (you, Tendiin) who is able to put in a bit work regularly, and now he might not be able to anymore...sugar :-/ --[[User:Kajolus|Kajolus]] 12:24, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::To make matters worse, I was just going to suggest that we re-tool some because we weren't really working on a book atm, mostly on a strat guide. So I was going to talk to you about making it more book like. &lt;shrug&gt; [[User:Tendiin|Tendiin]] 14:17, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Programming independence from language ==

&quot;The page is &quot;off topic&quot; - Computer programming should be independent of programming lanugage&quot;

=== RPG ===

In my opinion, the structure of language can be so different or similar, that a person writing about programming, who only knows a group of languages with similar structure, cannot help but describe computer programming using human language and examples that are foreign to other programming environments.  Thus it is really important in any such text to reference what languages this text is relevant to. [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 13:52, 18 July 2005 (UTC)

=== [[Programming:RPG]] ===

Well done. Just one observation: there is actually a WikiBook called [[Programming:RPG]] - which might be more suited for your text.

Or prehaps you want to try a side by site chapter. See 

* [[Programming:Ada#Computer_Programming]]
* [[Computer_programming#Key_concepts]]
* [[Programming:Python#Computer_Programming]]

They are difficult to make but when finished very rewarding. i.E. I very much like the [[Computer programming/Statements]] Chapter.

If you do the beginning I fill in the [[Programming:Ada]] pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gauss's Analysis of Curved Surfaces - The Origin of the Metric Tensor==

It became apparent at the start of the nineteenth century that issues such as Euclid's parallel postulate required the development of a new type of geometry that could deal with curved surfaces and real and imaginary planes. At the foundation of this approach is Gauss's analysis of curved surfaces which allows us to work with a variety of coordinate systems and displacements on any type of surface.

Suppose there is a line on a surface. The length of this line can be expressed in terms of a coordinate system. A short length of line &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s in a two dimensional space may be expressed in terms of Pythagoras' theorem as:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;y&lt;SUP&gt; 2

&lt;/SUP&gt;Suppose there is another coordinate system on the surface with two axes: x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;, &lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;, how can the length of the line be expressed in terms of these coordinates? Gauss tackled this problem and his analysis is quite straightforward for two coordinate axes: 

'''Figure 1:'''

[[Image:constudtensor.gif]]

It is possible to use elementary differential geometry to describe displacements along the plane in terms of displacements on the curved surfaces:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;

The displacement of a short line is then assumed to be given by a formula, called a metric, such as Pythagoras' theorem

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;S&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

Or some other metric such as the metric of a 4D Minkowskian space:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;S&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = -&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;T&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;X&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

This type of analysis can be extended to any number of dimensions. It is then possible to express the short length, &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s, in terms of the coordinates. The full algebraic analysis is given at the end of this appendix. In 3D the expression for the length is:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;SS&lt;/FONT&gt; (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;X/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;X/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;) &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;

g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt; = (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;)

If the coordinates are not merged then &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s is dependent on both sets of coordinates. In matrix notation:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;B&gt;g&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;

becomes:


&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH=264&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1 &lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;

times&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;9%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
c&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;9%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
d&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

Where a, b, c, d stand for the values of g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt;.


&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;32%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;a +&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;c&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;34%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;b +&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;d&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
Times&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;16%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;32%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;34%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;18%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;16%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Which is:

(&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;a +&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;c)&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;b +&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;d) &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;a + 2&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;(c&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;b)&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;d

So: 

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;a + 2&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;(c&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;b)&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;d

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; is a &lt;B&gt;bilinear form&lt;/B&gt; that depends on both &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; and &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;. It can be written in matrix notation as: 

&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;T&lt;/SUP&gt; A &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;/B&gt;

Where &lt;B&gt;A&lt;/B&gt; is the matrix containing the values in g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt;. This is a special case of the bilinear form known as the &lt;B&gt;quadratic form&lt;/B&gt; because the same matrix (&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;/B&gt;) appears twice; in the generalised bilinear form &lt;B&gt;B = x&lt;SUP&gt;T&lt;/SUP&gt;Ay&lt;/B&gt; (the matrices &lt;B&gt;x&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;y&lt;/B&gt; are different).

If the surface is a Euclidean plane then the values of g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt; are:

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;51%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;49%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;51%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;49%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Which become:

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;53%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;47%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;53%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;47%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

So the matrix &lt;B&gt;A&lt;/B&gt; is the unit matrix &lt;B&gt;I&lt;/B&gt; and:

&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;T&lt;/SUP&gt; I &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x

&lt;/B&gt;and:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

Which recovers Pythagoras' theorem.

If the surface is derived from &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = -&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;Z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; then the values of g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt; are:


&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
-(&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;) + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;

&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;-(d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;) + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;50%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;-(d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;Y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;) + dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;dZ&lt;/FONT&gt;/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Which becomes:

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;53%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
-1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;47%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;53%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;47%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Which allows the original 'rule' to be recovered i.e.: &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = -&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

===The Space-Time Interval===

The fundamental assumption of modern relativity theory is that the space-time interval is invariant. The space-time interval is given by the following equation rather than Pythagoras' theorem:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = - &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;t&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

The origin of the negative sign in front of &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;t is of considerable interest. It could originate from an assumption that time is imaginary, that time is real and the metric has a negative sign for time, or that time is mixed real and imaginary with a Pythagorean metric.

====Imaginary Time====

Suppose that Pythagoras theorem applied to the space-time interval and:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt; t&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

g&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/SUB&gt; = (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;t/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;t/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; + d&lt;/FONT&gt;x/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;i &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;k&lt;/SUP&gt;)

For a flat surface &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;t/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;0&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;1&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;y/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;z/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt; = 1 and all other coefficients are zero therefore:

'g' =

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;

&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;

&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;


Which means that the time interval must be imaginary if the assumption of relativity is to be supported i.e.: &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;t&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;DT&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;&amp;Ouml;&lt;/FONT&gt; -1)&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt;

So that &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;t&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; becomes &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = - &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;T&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

This form of time is not supported in General Relativity Theory

====Real Time====

If real time is used then the expressions for each displacement along each coordinate axis remain the same e.g.:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;T = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;T/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;T/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;T/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;T/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;

etc.

But when they are combined the formula &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = - &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;T&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; is used instead of Pythagoras' theorem (see above for a fully worked example in 2D). This results in the following metric tensor:

'g' =

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
-1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Where g&lt;SUB&gt;00&lt;/SUB&gt; is given by -1 times (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;t/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;0&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt;.

====Mixed Real and Imaginary Time====

There is a third possibility that is not generally discussed. The 'plane' in figure 1 is a plane in the observer's coordinate system and the surface has its own coordinate system. If the time coordinate on the surface were 'imaginary' and that on the plane were real (or vice versa) then using Pythagoras' theorem:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;Dt&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

where &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;t&lt;/FONT&gt; equals (kt), k being a constant that is yet to be determined. In flat space-time g&lt;SUB&gt;00&lt;/SUB&gt; is given by (&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;t/&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;0&lt;/SUP&gt;)&lt;SUP&gt; 2&lt;/SUP&gt;. But t is imaginary so g&lt;SUB&gt;00&lt;/SUB&gt; equals -1. This then gives exactly the same metric tensor as the assumption of real time.

'g' =

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
-1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&lt;/TR&gt;

&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;26%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
0&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;24%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
1&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

===The Modern Formulation of the Metric Tensor===

The modern formulation uses the following mathematical expression for the space-time interval:

s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = g&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;mn&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/SUB&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;n&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;m&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; 

where the values of s, x represent tiny displacements in each of the four coordinate axes and 'g' is the metric of the space. It is '''assumed''' that g&lt;SUB&gt;00&lt;/SUB&gt; is opposite in sign to the other constants on the principle diagonal (i.e.: real or mixed real and imaginary time are assumed). With this assumption the expression becomes: 

s&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - x&lt;SUB&gt;4&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

The expansion is shown below. In matrix notation this is:

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;38%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;14%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;14%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
X&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;38%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;11%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;

X&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

(Where t is time in metres, i.e.:c times time in secs). The numbers -1,1,1,1 are the values of the combinations of differential cofficients that were described above.

Evaluating the first matrix multiplication this becomes:

&lt;TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=7&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;44%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
-T x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
times&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;31%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
T&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;44%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;31%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
X&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;44%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;31%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
X&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;44%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;25%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;31%&quot; VALIGN=&quot;TOP&quot;&gt;
X&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Which resolves to: s&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + x&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - t&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

Which is the metric of space-time and applies to quite large values of s,x and t in the absence of accelerations and strong gravitational fields. Notice how the computation is more like a squared norm than a simple square and carries with it the physical implication of a product of a vector with its reflection (!).

The metric is normally expressed in differential form so that it can be used with a curved space-time and with displacements that are not measured relative to the origin.

ds&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = dx&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + dx&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + dx&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - dt&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; 

Or, equivalently:

ds&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = dt&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - dx&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - dx&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - dx&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;

Which recovers Pythagoras' theorem. 

However in the most general case the small intervals may not be related by Pythagoras' theorem:

Suppose

So, as before:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y = &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; = &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; + &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;D&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;Y/&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot; SIZE=1&gt;d&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=1&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

==Incomplete==
This chart is incomplete. It is missing certain compound characters and voiced characters. - 67.169.44.125
: Could you point out which ones? - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 16:38, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
::According to [[Japanese/Lessons/Lesson 6#Games|one of the training programs]] ''Kye'' and ''wi'' for example are used. It also lists different Romaji transliterations of the voiced form of ''chi'', namely ''dzi'' in stead of ''ji''. The last character of katakana ローマ字 (Romaji) isn't even listed at all. I would say this table needs some work. I suggest you take a look at [[w:Katakana]], which lists several updates to this table. [[User:Redge|Redge]] 13:55, 18 October 2005 (UTC)
::# &quot;Used&quot; is a relative term. &quot;wi&quot; and &quot;we&quot; are occasionally used for their old-fashioned look, and of course appear in older literature. Not sure what you mean about &quot;kye&quot;.
::# You won't find 字 in the table because it's kanji, not katakana.
::# You're right, the missing &quot;foreign sound&quot; katakana should be added.
::# There are several Romanization conventions, and we shouldn't try to cram them all into one table. The contributors to this wikibook have adopted a convention that they judged to be best.
:::-[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 08:25, 19 October 2005 (UTC)
::::Perhaps it is simply a matter of Slime Forrest and this wikibook using different standards, but it's frustrating of having to decide between the lessons you learn here and the ones rehearsed in Slime Forrest. Anyway, Forrest lists キエ as kye in stead of ki e, is what I ment. Excuse me for jumping to conclusions here. [[User:Redge|Redge]] 09:10, 20 October 2005 (UTC)
:::::I tried the game just a few minutes but it seems that I don't have enough time to find (nor patience to wait for it) キエ as kye. Probably it's キェ (small ェ, not large エ). Er..., if the game uses &quot;kye&quot; for キエ (not キェ), it's simply wrong. キエ is &quot;kie&quot;.
:::::Although this is my personal feeling, I don't think it's a good idea to practice *typing* ヰ and ヱ so many times (even in a few minutes play, I was made to type them several times). If you are able to read them, that's enough. In what occasion do you need to ''type'' them? At least I've hardly used them. Perhaps just two or three times, including now. In fact, they are so rarely used that the old version of ATOK I use did not know &quot;wi&quot; and &quot;we&quot; for ヰ and ヱ, thus I had to find them from character table it includes (ATOK is one of Romaji to Kanji converters; it's possible newer versions know them). Well, if you're going to study Japanese classic literature, the ability might be useful, but if not... - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 10:12, 20 October 2005 (UTC) mod.

==Bolded sounds==
Why are some of the letters (both Katakana and Hiragana) for certain sounds bolded?
:Your question is answered in the notes accompanying the table. [[User:Redge|Redge]] 13:55, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

== Breaking up the girl ==

I really like this table, but how about revamping it still. I'm unsure about the benefit of listing the kana together and find the romaji stands out too much with it in bold. It still needs some distinction but the kana in bold might not render very well for everyone. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:44, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

: The reasoning to have the kana in bold was ridiculous.  This is a kana chart and should be used as a reference, and not as a tutorial.  This could go into the actual hiragana/katakana pages, where the information is easily assimilated than in this crowded table.

: I'm not sure how to revise the chart other than making two separate charts.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 19:11, 14 June 2008 (UTC)

:: &quot;''The reasoning ... was ridiculous.''&quot; Ouch. I apologise for failing seeing things the same way as you do. Perhaps we can try to see where the other is coming from before calling things ridiculous?
:: I would sincerely be interested in learning for what sort of situations such a reference would be of great use. Since all seem agreed that learning the syllabaries should be one of the first steps, I'd expect that rather than needing to look up the sound to find the kana character, the student might on occasion wish to find which sound a character makes. In such cases, highlighting the character being looked for would make sense.
:: I might experiment with splitting these tables up on seperate pages and then just transcluding them here. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:01, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

::: Roomaji is a poor reference to show something is pronounced.  This chart shouldn't be used as such.  It should be used as a lookup/reference to remind the student on the consonant+vowel, y-medial compound, and other special characters.  It should not be used as a tutorial.
::: Furthermore, this chart shouldn't be making special notes on how often a word starts with characters and/or how often the character is used within the language's vocabulary.  This information should be used within other means.  Jamming too many concepts onto this chart is going to ruin its use.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 00:27, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

:::: I agree that romaji is a poor reference to show pronunciation. I don't think I was arguing otherwise.
:::: I agree that the table shouldn't be intended as a tutorial. I didn't suggest that it be one.
:::: I simply asked in which situations a student might wish to refer to a table indexed by romaji, given that learning the syllabaries would be one of the first steps. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:23, 27 June 2008 (UTC)
::::: My biggest problem isn't the roomaji.  I was just stating that roomaji isn't a good source to show a sound of a kana character.  My problem is the combination of bolding the roomaji and the kana.  The former to help the user focus on the roomaji characters and the latter to illustrate infrequent characters.  The latter is not needed.  It could go elsewhere, like individual kana pages. --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 17:29, 27 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">To form a Japanese sentence, you just need to remember few simple rules:
* Personal pronouns are mostly omitted, or replaced with names:
*: すき　だ - I like it/you
*: ほんだくん　が　すき　だ - I like you (when talking to Honda-kun)
* A normal (full) sentence always ends with a verb (even if it is an attributive verb, usually called verbal adjectives or the Japanese true adjective; we will discuss this more thoroughly later) and, optionally, special sentence-ending particles (mostly used to convey emotions and emphasis) after it. One verb alone may be treated like a full sentence. No other parts of speech can form a sentence alone. To end a sentence which does not have any action, and simply describes qualities of objects (&quot;a person is sitting&quot; is not a description of a quality, but rather a continuous action), copula verb で　ある (or any of its forms, including だ) must be used.
*: すごい - It's great
*: いく　ぞ - I am going
*: これ　は　ほん　だ - This is a book
** Note that there are some exceptions when another particles are overtaking the だ copula (this note only applies to this only copula verb form; other で　ある forms do not have such exceptions) functions (for example, だ　か cannot end sentence, か is considered to possess verbal functions in this case).
**: それ　は　ほん　か - Is that a book?
** Another exception is that the subject of the sentence may sometimes be placed right after the end of a sentence (after the verb with all sentence-ending particles), but no particles may be added afterwards. This construction although rarely used, is acceptable in spoken language for emphasizing the person you are talking to or talking about:
**: すごい　ねえ, ほんだくん - It's great, Honda-kun!
* If you want to give focus to an object or expression, put a が after it. If you want to give focus to what an object or expression does (to an action), put a は after it:
*: ぼく　は　いく　ぞ - I'm *going*
*: ぼく　が　いく　ぞ - It's *me*, who is going
*: わたし　は　あなた　が　きらい　だ - I hate you.
* Time of the events is usually put at the beginning of the sentence:
*: きょう　とうきょう　に　いく - Today I am going to Tokyo.

[[Image:Brühwürfel-1.jpg|thumb|Various stock cubes]]

A '''bouillon cube''' (US) or '''stock cube''' (UK and Australia) is dehydrated broth (''bouillon'' in French) or stock formed into a small cube about 15 mm wide. It is made by dehydrating vegetables, meat stock, a small portion of solid fat (such as hydrogenated oil), salt (usually well over 50%) and seasonings (usually including monosodium glutamate) and shaping them into a small cube. Dehydrated broth is also available in granular form.

Broth made from rehydrated cubes is different in taste from fresh broth because of its higher salt content and flavors changed by the boiling process. Bouillon cubes are convenient and inexpensive. The cubes are widely used in English cooking to add flavor.

Common brands include Oxo, [Knorr, Rose Hill, Jumbo brand (Gallina Blanca), Maggi, Hormel's Herb-Ox, Wyler's, Goya and Kallo.</text>

ETF is a direct port of a Quake III mod called Q3F (which has ceased in development) to Enemy Territory. This wiki covers the use of entities in ETF map making. It is apparently adapted from the Q3F Map Entity Documentation.

== Overview ==

=== What it's all about ===

The ETF entities are intended to be an extension to existing entities rather than replacing the current entities (at least, as far as possible). Currently, they're both incomplete and potentially bug-ridden. Many features we'd like to add haven't yet been added, and some entity types will not coexist happily with the extensions. 

Initially the entities info_notnull, func_goalitem, func_commandpoint and func_goalinfo defaulted to a 30 second wait when there was NO wait field given. This default wait has been removed since Beta1f to stop some serious issues and make the entities more logical. If your map was based around this default wait, a recompile is needed. 

Some of the worldspawn fields have changed, to make them shorter. Q3 couldn't parse the long keys and gave errors on compile. Finally, the ammo_bullets is now called ammo_nails, which is more logical, too.

You can now use the mapinfo files to set atmosphere and class names, names, team names, allied teams, etc. throughout the whole map or for a specified gameindex.

=== Basic Principles ===

Essentially, each entity has a 'state', as follows: 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Invisible'''
| This entity is not triggerable, nor is it visible (although this has some odd side effects, e.g. invisible doors still stop people from walking through them).
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Disabled'''
| This entity is not triggerable.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Inactive'''
| This entity is idle (and can be thought of as 'touchable'). For goalitems, this means 'back at base'. 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Active'''
| This entity is active, and (depending on its settings), will go back to inactive after a set time. For goalitems, this means 'lying on the ground'. 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Carried'''
| This state only applies to goalitems.
|}

When successfully touched by a player, an entity will attempt to go to carried/active state. After a set time, active entities will automatically go back to inactive. 

Entities can also trigger other entities in a 'cascade' of triggers, by using &lt;state&gt;target keys, e.g. on a flag entity you might have &quot;carriedtarget&quot; &quot;alarms&quot; - that would activate all 'alarms' entities when a flag became carried. 

There are a set of criteria checked before an entity can be triggered (although triggers can also be 'forced' to ignore criteria, more on this later). 

In addition to this, players can be 'given' bonuses, and teams can be given scores, as well as having messages and sounds played.

=== What it can do ===

*It can be used to create complex map effects and the like (think of Team Fortress), as well as some degree of 'scripting'.

=== What it can't do ===

*It can't be used as a language in its own right - it will maintain no variables, parse no scripts. This may become available in a future release, but not right now (also, there would be performance questions in a scripting language).

== Examples ==

=== Trigger Types ===

There are six main sorts of triggers you'll use:

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Brush triggers'''
| This is something like a trigger_multiple - an area brush that triggers when you walk over it.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Point triggers'''
| These are used as func_goalinfo entities, and can have mins and maxs set to define their actual size. They trigger when you walk into the defined area surrounding the entity - they can also do other effects, such as showing a model that becomes invisible while active, etc. 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Untouchable triggers'''
| These are usually set as info_notnull, and act as relays or simply alternative triggers (i.e. two entities with the same name, one only triggerable by blue and one only triggerable by red). 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Flags'''
| These are used as func_goalitem entities (or func_flag, same thing), and are 'carried' by the player when successfully touched. 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Standard entities'''
| These are things like func_door, or info_player_start entities - they act in more or less the usual fashion, but the criteria and cascading triggers still operate. 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Special entities'''
| These are things like the func_commandpoint - new entities that have special behaviour defined by the entity. (More on these later).
|}

=== Sample Flag ===

A 'flag' is a carryable entity that can only be carried by one team, and does various effects when carried. 
&lt;pre&gt;
{
    // The red flag 

    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;func_goalitem&quot;
    // this one is set by the editor when you position the entity:
    &quot;origin&quot; &quot;1248 1984 -328&quot;

    // What it looks like    
    &quot;model&quot; &quot;models/flags/r_flag.md3&quot;    // Model to use    
    &quot;light&quot; &quot;200&quot;                        // Dynamic light
    &quot;color&quot; &quot;1 0 0&quot;                      // Pure red
    &quot;sparkle&quot; &quot;1 0 0&quot;                    // Generate smoke puffs around carrier

    // What it's called
    &quot;groupname&quot; &quot;redflag&quot;

    // Criteria
    &quot;allowteams&quot; &quot;blue&quot;    // Only blue players can trigger (i.e. carry)

    // Messages on trigger
    // Centerprint message to activator:
    &quot;carried_message&quot; &quot;~You have taken the ^1RED^* flag!&quot;
    // Tell everyone activator has done it:
    &quot;carried_all_message&quot; &quot;~%N has TAKEN the ^1RED^* flag!&quot;
    // Tell everyone activator dropped the flag:
    &quot;active_all_message&quot; &quot;~%N has DROPPED the ^1RED^* flag!&quot;
    &quot;inactive_all_message&quot; &quot;The ^1RED^* flag has returned.&quot;
    // Play Sound to team:
    &quot;carried_team_sound&quot; &quot;~sound/teamplay/voc_team_flag.wav&quot;
    // Play Sound to non-team players:
    &quot;carried_nonteam_sound&quot; &quot;~sound/teamplay/voc_enemy_flag.wav&quot;
    // Play Sound to activator:
    &quot;carried_sound&quot; &quot;~sound/teamplay/voc_you_flag.wav&quot;

    // Flaginfo (shown on \flaginfo command)
    &quot;carried_flaginfo&quot; &quot;%N has the ^1RED^* flag.&quot;
    &quot;active_flaginfo&quot; &quot;The ^1RED^* flag has been dropped at $l.&quot;			
    // Flags must use $l for active_flaginfo and active_all_message
    &quot;inactive_flaginfo&quot; &quot;The ^1RED^* flag is at the red base.&quot;

    // Misc
    // Reveal spies on trigger, show flag above player when carried:
    &quot;flags&quot; &quot;revealagent,showcarry&quot;
    // Wait 45 seconds before going inactive (i.e. back to base):
    &quot;wait&quot; &quot;45&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Sample Capture Point ===

Now we have a flag, we need somewhere to capture it. 

&lt;pre&gt;
{
    // The capture point in the blue base

    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;trigger_multiple&quot;
    // Origin/size defined by brush (never set)
    &quot;model&quot; &quot;*10&quot;

    // Criteria
    // Only trigger if activator holds redflag:
    &quot;holding&quot; &quot;redflag&quot;

    // Messages
    // Centerprint message to everyone:
    &quot;active_all_message&quot; &quot;~%N has CAPTURED the ^1RED^* flag!&quot;
    &quot;active_message&quot; &quot;You have scored 2 frags for capturing the flag.&quot;
    // Play sound to activator:
    &quot;active_sound&quot; &quot;~sound/teamplay/voc_blue_scores.wav&quot;
    // Play sound to activator's team (apart from activator):

    // 'Give' bonuses
    &quot;give&quot; &quot;score=+2,health=+100,armor=+200,ammo_shells=+200,ammo_nails=+200,ammo_cells=+200,ammo_rockets=+200,ammo_medikit=+50,gren1=+4,gren2=+2&quot;    
    // Give activator's team 10 points (the teamscore, not the players on the team):

    // When activated, force redflag to inactive (back to base),
    // trigger scorer (optional extra 10 points entity):
    &quot;activetarget&quot; &quot;redflag=~inactive,scorer&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Sample Command Point ===

To make things a little more interesting, why don't we have a 'scorer' command point that gives players an extra 10 points when they capture the flag? 

&lt;pre&gt;
{
    // A button to press to claim the command point

    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;func_button&quot;
    &quot;model&quot; &quot;*1&quot;
    &quot;angle&quot; &quot;-2&quot;
    &quot;wait&quot; &quot;5&quot;
    // Trigger the scorer command point when activated:
    &quot;activetarget&quot; &quot;scorer_cp&quot;
}

{
    // The scorer command point (no model, so must be triggered by another entity)

    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;func_commandpoint&quot;
    &quot;origin&quot; &quot;448 832 -128&quot;

    // Misc
    &quot;groupname&quot; &quot;scorer_cp&quot;

    // Messages
    &quot;active_all_message&quot; &quot;~%N has claimed the\ncapture bonus for the %T!&quot;

    // On activation (i.e. touch if we have a model, or trigger by a button
    // or something otherwise)
    // All entities named 'scorer' are locked to activators team:
    &quot;teamset&quot; &quot;scorer&quot;
    // Set scorer to inactive (i.e. ready to be activated):
    &quot;activetarget&quot; &quot;scorer=inactive&quot;
}

{
    // An untouchable 'scorer' entity
    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;info_notnull&quot;    
    &quot;origin&quot; &quot;444 828 -84&quot;         // Hardly 'essential' in this case...

    // Misc
    &quot;groupname&quot; &quot;scorer&quot;           // So other entities can reference
    // Prevent scorer from being triggered initially
    // (i.e. until command point is claimed):
    &quot;initialstate&quot; &quot;disabled&quot;

    // On activation
    &quot;teamscore&quot; &quot;10&quot;               // Give the activator's team 10 points
    // Go inactive after 1 second (the chances of someone capturing twice
    // in under a second are pretty slim...):
    &quot;wait&quot; &quot;1&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Sample Hud ===
We've forgotten something - we need to show a player if he's carrying the flag or not, or he's liable to get confused (and upset if he finds he's had it for the last 5 minutes without capturing). We need a HUD entity. 

&lt;pre&gt;
{
    // A HUD entity shown to the red flag carrier
    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;func_hud&quot;
    &quot;origin&quot; &quot;1252 1980 -292&quot;

    // Entity never actually activates, just show this model:
    &quot;inactive_model&quot; &quot;models/flags/r_flag.md3&quot;
    &quot;slot&quot; &quot;1&quot;            // Display it in slot 1 (top left)
    &quot;holding&quot; &quot;redflag&quot;   // Only player holding redflag can see this entity
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Reference ==

=== Entity States ===
Essentially, each entity has a 'state', as follows:

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Invisible'''
| This entity is not triggerable, nor is it visible (although this has some odd side effects, e.g. invisible doors still stop people walking through them).
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Disabled'''
| This entity is not triggerable.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Inactive'''
| This entity is idle (and can be thought of as 'touchable'). For goalitems, this means 'back at base'.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Active'''
| This entity is active, and (depending on its settings), will go back to inactive after a set time. For goalitems, this means 'lying on the ground'.
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''Carried'''
| This state only applies to goalitems. 
|}

When a player touches an entity and the criteria are passed, it will be triggered to carried (if it's a carryable entity), or active. 

Unless forced (see targets), only certain state changes are permitted (note that you cannot change state to the current state (nothing at all will happen): 

{|border=&quot;1&quot;

|-
|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;16%&quot; &lt;font face=&quot;Verdana, Tahoma, Arial&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;|carried
|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;16%&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;16%&quot;|&amp;nbsp;

|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;16%&quot;|&amp;nbsp;
|}

When an entity changes state, it will trigger any messages or sounds for that state, as well as executing give (only when in carried/active state, depending on whether it can be carried), teamscore (again, only in carried/active) and &lt;state&gt;target (see targets). 

An entity can have its state changed a maximum of 5 times (currently) per-frame single frame - this is to prevent infinite loops from hanging the server - but you would be wiser to avoid any situations where this kicks in (since you cannot always be sure what state the entity will end up in, particularly if the limit changes).

=== Messages ===
When an entity changes state, messages and sounds can be sent out to various players, optionally with the 'force' flag (prefixing the string with a ~ symbol). The force flag causes messages to be centerprinted and sounds to be global (i.e. no attenuation). Messages can be sent to four different groups: The activator, the activator's team (excluding activator), all players not on the activator's team, or all players. 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| '''&lt;state&gt;_message'''
| Send a message to the activator. 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_team_message'''
| Send a message to the activator's teammates. 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_nonteam_message'''
| Send a message to all players not on the activator's team.  
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_all_message'''
| Send a message to all players. 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_sound'''
| Play a sound to the activator (currently, plays globally as though ~ was specified). 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_team_sound'''
| Play a sound to the activator's teammates (currently, plays globally as though ~ was specified). 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_nonteam_sound'''
| Play a sound to all players not on the activator's team (currently, plays globally as though ~ was specified). 
|-
| '''&lt;state&gt;_all_sound'''
| Play a sound to all players.
|}

&lt;state&gt; in the above strings means the state to play on, e.g. active_message. For sounds, currently only sounds everyone can hear (&lt;state&gt;_all_sound) can be played 'unforced' (i.e. fades with distance from the entity). 

Additionally, there is another prefix that is not a state. This is the kill prefix. It is used just as the other messages, but useful for o.a. trigger_hurt entities. Example: &quot;kill_all_message&quot; &quot;%n shouldn't have been here.&quot; as a keypair on a trigger_hurt will display &quot;Dummy shouldn't have been here.&quot; as a deathmessage when the player called Dummy gets killed by the trigger_hurt. 

Messages can also contain tokens that are expanded as required. Tokens in UPPERCASE represent the activator (if present). Tokens in lowercase represent the entity itself: 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| '''%H'''
| Health 
|-
| '''%A'''
| Armor 
|-
| '''%L'''
| Location (returns 'unknown location' if unable to work it out) 
|-
| '''%D'''
| Location of last death. 
|-
| '''%R'''
| Last reported location (i.e. identical to last %L) 
|-
| '''%T'''
| Team name (e.g. &quot;Red Team&quot;, &quot;Blue Team&quot; etc.) 
|-
| '''%C'''
| Team colour (e.g. red, blue etc.) 
|-
| '''%G'''
| Disguise (returns 'not disguised' if not wearing a disguise) 
|-
| '''%N'''
| Name (player name / entity groupname (or one of them) 
|-
| '''%E'''
| State (e.g. &quot;active&quot;, &quot;carried&quot; etc.) 
|-
| '''%S'''
| Class (e.g. &quot;soldier&quot;, &quot;medic&quot; etc.) 
|}
For example, you could say: 
&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;active_flaginfo&quot; &quot;The ^1RED^* flag has been dropped at $l.&quot;
// $l is used for locations of the goalitem entity dunno why but it is.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Incidentally, you can use these tokens in communications as well (case does not matter), save that you require $ instead of %. If you want to annoy everyone on the server, just say &quot;Hello $r, I'm $n of the $t.&quot; (I wouldn't really recommend it, though). $r is readers name now instead of $n.

=== Flaginfo ===
Flaginfo is sent to players who execute a \flaginfo command. All entities that have a &lt;state&gt;_flaginfo will have that info sent to the client. Normally, it's flags and the like that keep flaginfo, hence the command name. For flags, you'd expect a carried, active, and inactive flaginfo string, e.g. 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| '''carried_flaginfo'''
| &quot;%N has the red flag at %L (and only %H health left)&quot;
|-
| '''active_flaginfo'''
| &quot;The red flag is lying in the field at $l&quot; (note the lowercase and $, there's no carrier!)
|-
| '''inactive_flaginfo'''
| &quot;The red flag is safe at base&quot;
|}

=== Give ===
Entities can 'give' bonuses to affected players when set to carried (if a carryable entity) or active (if not). The give string is of the form &quot;give&quot; &quot;stat=value,stat=value,stat=value&quot;. The following stats are available: 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''health'''
| Health
|- 
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''armor'''
| Armor
|- 
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''damage'''
| Deal damage to the target 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_shells'''
| Shells
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_nails'''
| Nails
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_rockets'''
| Rockets 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_cells'''
| Cells 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_medikit'''
| Medikit ammo 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ammo_charge'''
| HE Charge 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''score'''
| Player score (not teamscore) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''gren1'''
| Grenade type 1 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''gren2'''
| Grenade type 2 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''quad'''
| Seconds of quad damage 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''regen'''
| Seconds of regen 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''flight'''
| Seconds of flight 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''battlesuit'''
| Seconds of battlesuit 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''invis'''
| Seconds of invisibility (shimmer invis, not agent invis) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''haste'''
| Seconds of haste 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''invuln'''
| Seconds of invulnerability 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aqualung'''
| Seconds of aqualung 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''ceasefire'''
| Seconds a player is unable to shoot 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''gas'''
| Seconds of gas 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''stun'''
| Seconds of stun 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''flash'''
| Seconds of flash 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''tranq'''
| Seconds of tranq 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''fire'''
| Amount of fire counters, every counter does a certain amount of burn damage every few seconds 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''armortype'''
| Armour type (as a number from 0-100). This is the amount of damage the armour saves you from* 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_shell'''
| If true, give 15% extra protection against shells (otherwise remove) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_bullet'''
| If true, give 15% extra protection against nailgun / sniper rifle (otherwise remove) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_explosive'''
| If true, give 15% extra protection against explosions (otherwise remove) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_shock'''
| If true, give 15% extra protection against emp/electrical attacks (otherwise remove) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_fire'''
| If true, give 15% extra protection against fire and prevent burning (otherwise remove) 
|-
|valign=&quot;top&quot;| '''aclass_all'''
| If true, set all armour classes (otherwise, remove all armour classes) 
|}

If not forced (with a ~ prefix), these values are limited to player maximums. If + or - is prefixed, they're added or removed from existing values rather than set, e.g. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;give&quot; &quot;health=~500,armor=+50,score=+3,quad=10,haste=10,aclass_fire=1&quot; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Would give a player 500 health (no matter their class max), 50 more armour (up to class max), 3 points, ten seconds of quad and haste (no matter what they had before), and fire-resistant armour. 

If armortype is not specified and armour is given (i.e. the player gets more armour than they had before the command), it is automatically assumed that their armour type should be set to the maximum. If you want their armour type to remain unchanged, put in a key like &quot;armortype=+0&quot;. 

There are also a set of entity keys that affect the command: 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| '''affectteams'''
| Affect the named teams, (e.g. &quot;red,blue&quot;) regardless of which team activated this entity 
|-
| '''effectradius'''
| Affect only those players within the specified radius 
|-
| '''holding'''
| Affect only those players holding these goalitems 
|-
| '''notholding'''
| Affect only those players not holding these goalitems 
|-
| '''clientstats'''
| Affect only those matching these clientstats 
|}

Note that the way the criteria work, it first checks affectteams and the affectteam/affectnonteam flags for players to affect, and them limits this based on the lineofsight/environment flags.

=== Flags ===
An entity's key &quot;flags&quot; can be used to specify a comma-separated list of boolean flags that affect the entity's behavior in multiple areas, as follows. These can be categorised as criteria/effect/command flags: 

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| '''hideactive''' (cmd)
| Cause the entity to be invisible while active (e.g. for refill goalinfos).
|-
| '''affectteam''' (eff)
| Cause the 'give' command to affect everyone on the activator's team. 
|-
| '''affectnonteam''' (eff)
| Cause the 'give' command to affect everyone not on the activator's team. 
|-
| '''dropoff''' (eff)
| 'give' values 'drop off' with distance (requires a 'range' key in the entity). 
|-
| '''lineofsight''' (eff)
| Only entities in line of sight will be affected. 
|-
| '''environment''' (eff)
| Only entities in the same environment will be affected. 
|-
| '''shootable''' (cmd)
| Allow shooting the entity to be equivalent to touching it (only for func_doors). 
|-
| '''reversecriteria''' (cri)
| Causes the entity to only be triggered if the criteria are NOT met. 
|-
| '''orclientstats''' (cri)
| Causes the clientstats criteria to be OR instead of AND. 
|-
| '''revealagent''' (cmd)
| If triggered, the activator will lose his disguise. 
|-
| '''showcarry''' (cmd)
| On carryable entities, cause it to be shown above the player, as with CTF flags. 
|-
| '''chargeable''' (cmd)
| Allow HE charging the entity to be equivalent to touching it. 
|-
| '''rotating''' (cmd)
| Cause the model to rotate and bob like an item (only for goalinfo/goalitems). 
|-
| '''noshrink''' (cmd)
| Goal does not grow or shrink when appearing/disappearing.
|-
| '''nodrop''' (cmd)
| On carryable entities, stop the 'dropflag' command affecting it. 
|-
| '''keepondeath''' (cmd)
| On carryable entities, don't drop on death. 
|-
| '''usegauntlet''' (cmd)
| Entity must be axed instead of touched. 
|-
| '''allowdead''' (cmd)
| Allow dead players to be selected in target_cycle use. 
|-
| '''allowsame''' (cmd)
| Allow same player to be selected in target_cycle use. 
|-
| '''faildirection''' (cmd)
| Forcefield direction field applies to those failing the criteria. 
|-
| '''allowsentrylock''' (cmd)
| Sentry is allowed to lock on through forcefields (bad idea :).
|-
| '''disguisecriteria''' (cri)
| Criteria work on agent's apparent team/class rather than real.
|}

=== Targets ===
The targeting system is what binds all the entities together into something more. When an entity changes state, it checks for &lt;state&gt;target and then attempts to set each named target to the specified state (default state if not specified is always 'active'). If forced by prefixing the state with a ~ character, criteria (and 'give'/'teamscore') are ignored, e.g.

&lt;pre&gt;&quot;carriedtarget&quot; &quot;redalarms,escapedoors=~disabled&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

Will cause the alarms to go to active (default if not specified), and forces all escape doors to be disabled, even if they're currently active (i.e. open).

To be targetable, entities must have either a targetname or a groupname key, the differences are as follows:

{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| targetname
| Can only hold a single name, affects some entities - e.g. targetname will stop doors opening when players touch them, and teleporters will only look at targetnames for a destination, etc.
|-
| groupname
| Can hold any number of names, separated by commas, and will respond to triggers on any of them - this allows much more complex entity interactions. It will not affect entities as having a targetname will.
|}
Wherever possible, please use groupname instead of targetname - it's much more flexible and less prone to side-effects.

Please note that unforced triggers (i.e. without a ~) will pass the same activator on to the triggered entity (i.e. the player rather than the entity passing the trigger on). Also, the criteria are still check against the activator).

If you find yourself having problems with this, try setting g_mapentDebug to 1 at the console - be warned that you'll get a lot of junk out of this, and it may not help much.

See the Entity States section for more information.

=== Criteria ===

Criteria are checks on whether or not the activator can actually trigger this entity. The following fields apply, as well as some flags:
{| border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=0
| allowteams
| Only the specified teams (e.g. &quot;red,blue&quot;) are allowed
|-
| allowclasses
| Only the specified classes (e.g. &quot;recon,grenadier,agent&quot;) are allowed
|-
| holding
| Only players holding all the specified entities (e.g. &quot;redkey1,redkey2&quot;) are allowed.
|-
| notholding
| Only players not holding all the specified entities (e.g. &quot;redkey1,redkey2&quot;) are allowed.
|-
| clientstats
| Only players matching the specified clientstats (e.g. &quot;health&lt;50,gren1=0,armour&lt;!&quot;) are allowed (see below).
|-
| checkstate
| The trigger is only valid if at least one of each named entity is in the specified state, e.g. &quot;redalarms=inactive,redflag=carried&quot;). If you want want to ensure all named entities are in a certain state, simply give each entity a unique group and check those.
|-
| disguisecriteria
| Criteria work on agent's apparent team/class rather than real.
|}

The clientstats value is a list of evaluators build up like this: [keyword][evaluator][value], with the evaluator being '=', '&lt;', '&gt;', '&lt;=' or '&gt;='. The value is an integer or '!' (indicates activators' class maximum) and the keys can be the following: health, armor, ammo_shells, ammo_nails, ammo_rockets, ammo_cells, score, gren1, gren2, quad, regen, flight, battlesuit, invis, haste, ammo_medikit, ammo_charge, invuln, aqualung, gas, stun, flash, tranq, fire, skill.

If the criteria fail (after the reversecriteria flag is applied), the 'failtarget' key will be executed - note that there's no 'wait' on failures, so don't do anything processor intensive.

=== Map Info ===

Each map should be accompanied by a &quot;mapinfo&quot; file, which lives in the maps directory with its map, e.g. maps/etf_map.bsp should be accompanied by a maps/etf_map.mapinfo file.

The mapinfo defines assorted properties describing the map, as well as overriding world-spawn attributes. The file format is something like:

&lt;pre&gt;
mapinfo {
	map		&quot;etf_map&quot;;					// BSP name
	longname	&quot;Mapname&quot;;					// Long name for map, general description of it
	type		&quot;etf&quot;;						// Game it is for (all etf maps are marked with &quot;etf&quot;)
	gameindices	&quot;1,2,3&quot;;					// Available gameindices
	atmosphere	&quot;T=RAIN,B=5 10,C=0.5,G=0.5 2,BV=0,GV=0 100,W=1 2,D=300&quot;;	// Atmospheric effects

	gameindexDef 1 {						// Gameindex Definition
		longname	&quot;Mapname CTF&quot;;	// Long name for this gameindex

Entries in gameIndexDef blocks override the default entries (which are not associated with any particular gameindex, and apply to all). Note that the gameindices field is required, and will default to &quot;1&quot; if not specified (however many gameIndexDef blocks there are).

| The name of the map it is associated with (not used, merely for completeness).
|-

| The maximum number of players recommended on the map.
|}

Each map+gameindex combination is treated as a completely separate map in voting lists. gameindexes should be a single digit from 1 to 9.

Any fields not mentioned here will override worldspawn keys instead (for example atmosphere).

=== Gameindices ===
Gameindices make it possible to have multiple scenarios in one map. Basically, all entities with a 'gameindex' key spawn only when the server has g_gameindex set to the same value.

For example, when an entity has &quot;gameindex&quot; &quot;1,2&quot;, it will only spawn when g_gameindex (which defaults to 1) is 1 or 2 on the server.

Also, for the server to know which gameindices are allowed for this map, there is a new key for the .arena file. This key is called 'gameindices' and has as value an array of the allowed gameindices. For example &quot;1,2,3&quot;, which results in g_gameindex 1, 2 and 3 being valid for this map. If it has a different value during the loading of the map, it defaults to 1.

=== Custom Infoparms ===
Q3F uses the -custinfoparms parameter of q3map 1.1-TA-beta and newer being distributed with GtkRadiant to extend Quake3's shader language.

Current custom infoparms:

particleclip 	Particles collide with this surface.
forcefield 	Used in combination with the func_forcefield entity to create forcefields.
footprints 	If a client walks over a shader with the footprints parameter set, he leaves a trail of footprints.
stone 	Stone footstep and ricochet sounds.
wood 	Wood footstep and ricochet sounds.
seethrough 	Translucent surface a sentry can track through even if it's solid.

To use these parameters, you need to add a 'custinfoparms.txt' file to your scripts directory (where your shaders live) and execute the bsp stage of the compile process with the additional -custinfoparms command line parameter.

The contents of the textfile used with Q3F:

&lt;pre&gt;
// Custom Surfaceparms file

// Custom Contentsflags
{
	particleclip 0x2000
	forcefield 0x4000
}
// Custom Surfaceflags
{
	footprints 0x80000
	stone 0x100000
	wood 0x200000
	seethrough 0x400000
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

/*QUAKED func_bobbing (0 .5 .8) ? X_AXIS Y_AXIS
Solid entity that oscillates back and forth in a linear motion. By default, it will have an amount of displacement in either direction equal to the dimension of the brush in the axis in which it's bobbing. Entity bobs on the Z axis (up-down) by default. It can also emit sound if the &quot;noise&quot; key is set. Will crush the player when blocked.
-------- KEYS --------
speed : amount of time in seconds for one complete oscillation cycle (default 4).
height : sets the amount of travel of the oscillation movement (default 32). 
phase : sets the start offset of the oscillation cycle. Values must be 0 &lt; phase &lt; 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
noise : path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav - See Notes).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of sound and .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
X_AXIS : entity will bob along the X axis.
Y_AXIS : entity will bob along the Y axis.
-------- NOTES --------
In order for the sound to be emitted from the entity, it is recommended to include a brush with an origin shader at its center, otherwise the sound will not follow the entity as it moves. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

/*QUAKED func_button (0 .5 .8) ?
When a button is touched by a player, it moves in the direction set by the &quot;angle&quot; key, triggers all its targets, stays pressed by an amount of time set by the &quot;wait&quot; key, then returns to it's original position where it can be operated again.
-------- KEYS --------
angle : determines the direction in which the button will move (up = -1, down = -2).
target : all entities with a matching targetname will be triggered.
speed : speed of button's displacement (default 40).
wait : number of seconds button stays pressed (default 1, -1 = return immediately).
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 4 units).

/*QUAKED func_pendulum (0 .5 .8) ?
Solid entity that describes a pendulum back and forth rotation movement. Rotates on the X axis by default. Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of the beam and gravity. Blocking the pendulum instantly kills a player.
-------- KEYS --------
angle : angle offset of axis of rotation from default X axis (default 0).
speed : angle of swing arc in either direction from initial position (default 30).
phase : sets the start offset of the swinging cycle. Values must be 0 &lt; phase &lt; 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
noise : path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of entity's rotation axis and .md3 model included with entity (default &quot;0 0 0&quot; - See Notes).

notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.*/

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ?
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper sounds for this entity, only beep noises. It will spawn in the game and work properly but it sounds silly (see Notes).
-------- KEYS --------
speed : determines how fast the plat moves (default 150).
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if &quot;height&quot; is set.
height : if set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
dmg : damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat (default 4). Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname : if set, the trigger that points to this will raise the plat each time it fires. The plat raises and comes back down a second later if no player is on it.
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the &quot;height&quot; key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the &quot;lip&quot; key. Using the &quot;height&quot; key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.*/

targetname : NOT SUPPORTED BY RENDERER - if set, a func_button or trigger can make entity disappear from the game (See Notes).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value. If a model is included with a targeted func_static, the brush(es) of the entity will be removed from the game but the .md3 model won't: it will automatically be moved to the (0 0 0) world origin so you should NOT include an .md3 model to a targeted func_static.

-------- NOTES --------
In genuine bot arena matches, the podium for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place players at the end of the match is generated by this entity. The podium's origin will automatically be located 128 units in the direction of the camera's view and 84 units down from the y height of the view line at that point. It will also always be generated on a level plane regardless of the pointing angle of the camera so if that angle is too steep, part of the podium model might not be visible. Make sure you leave at least 106 units of free space in front of where the camera points to otherwise the podium model won't be visible at all.*/

Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
noise : path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).
wait : delay in seconds between each time the sound is played (&quot;random&quot; key must be set - see Notes).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from &quot;wait&quot; delay (&quot;wait&quot; key must be set - see Notes).
targetname : the activating button or trigger points to this.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON : sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF : sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
GLOBAL : sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR : sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the &quot;noise&quot; key can be replaced by the implicit folder character &quot;*&quot; for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a &quot;bottomless pit&quot; in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the &quot;noise&quot; key to &quot;*falling1.wav&quot;. The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create &quot;player-specific&quot; triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the &quot;wait&quot; and &quot;random&quot; keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the &quot;random&quot; key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/

/*QUAKED func_forcefield (.5 .5 0) ?
ETF-only
Forcefields are conditional walls, which are only solid to players/weapons failing criteria. The criteria can be anything that would apply to a trigger (team/class/entity states/holding/notholding/clientstats, etc.), as well as directional barriers. 

The forcefield should be created as a func_forcefield entity, with all faces of brush marked with: 

	surfaceparm nonsolid
	surfaceparm forcefield

(Where forcefield is specified as forcefield 0x4000 in the custinfoparms.txt file.) 

-------- KEYS --------
&quot;angles&quot;: Specified as pitch yaw, fields with this key will only allow players through in the specified direction.
&quot;wait&quot;: number of seconds before the forcefield can activate again (default 2).
&quot;give&quot;: See entity docs for a complete documentation of give
&quot;flags&quot;: See entity docs for a complete documentation of flags

The forcefield is not suited for normal state setting - states should always be forced to ensure they go into the desired state, although it's not required. 

Invisible: Forcefields have no effect, all players can pass through.
Disabled: Forcefields act as normal, but fail to trigger.
Inactive: Forcefields act as normal, and trigger when someone passing the criteria passes through.
Active: See above, drops back to inactive after a default of 2 seconds). 

-------- NOTES --------
- All normal activation criteria apply: allowclasses, allowteams, checkstate, clientstats, holding, and notholding.
- Flags of interest: faildirection,allowstentrylock
- Weapons can travel through forcefields if their owners can, and in the same directions.
- Only team/class/direction prediction is possible client-side, any other criteria will cause the client to mispredict (and a 'jitter' effect will occur) - clients cannot finesse this to pass through the field.
- Pulse and Flash grenades are still effective through forcefields.
- Players within a forcefield who fail the criteria will be trapped as long as the forcefield is present.
- Players travelling through an 'upward' forcefield will rise up until they're standing on the surface, or cannot rise any further.
- Forcefields can be used to support player's weight, and form, e.g. one-team bridges. 
- You must compile the bsp stage of your map with the -custinfoparms option.
- custinfoparms.txt must exist in /scripts.

/*QUAKED func_door (0 .5 .8) ? START_OPEN - CRUSHER
Modified for ETF

Normal sliding door entity. By default, the door will activate when player walks close to it or when damage is inflicted to it.
-------- KEYS --------
angle : determines the opening direction of door (up = -1, down = -2).
speed : determines how fast the door moves (default 100).
wait : number of seconds before door returns (default 2, -1 = &quot;never return&quot; (in ETF) or &quot;return immediately&quot; in quake3) (ETF-modified)
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 8)
targetname : if set, a func_button or trigger is required to activate the door.
health : (default 0) if set to any non-zero value, the button must take damage (any amount) to activate.
dmg : damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of door (default 4). Door will reverse direction when blocked unless CRUSHER spawnflag is set.
team: assign the same team name to multiple doors that should operate together (see Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
START_OPEN : the door will spawn in the open state and operate in reverse.
CRUSHER : door will not reverse direction when blocked and will keep damaging player until he dies or gets out of the way.
-------- NOTES --------
Unlike in Quake 2, doors that touch are NOT automatically teamed. If you want doors to operate together, you have to team them manually by assigning the same team name to all of them. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED trigger_multiple (.5 .5 .5) ?
Modified for ETF
Variable size repeatable trigger. It will fire the entities it targets when touched by player. Can be made to operate like a trigger_once entity by setting the &quot;wait&quot; key to -1. It can also be activated by another trigger that targets it.
-------- KEYS --------
&lt;state&gt;target: activates when the entity enters &lt;state&gt; (ETF-only).
target : this points to the entity to activate.
targetname : activating trigger points to this.
wait : time in seconds until trigger becomes re-triggerable after it's been touched (default 0.2, -1 = trigger once).

notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/
All normal activation criteria apply: allowclasses, allowteams, checkstate, clientstats, holding, and notholding.

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED func_train (0 .5 .8) ?
Modified for ETF
Trains are moving solids that follow a string of path_corner entities. Trains in Q3A are very basic, they also require an origin brush (see Notes).

ETF Additions
When a func_train reaches a path_corner, it first checks if there is a next path_corner is available. 
This means that the next path_corner exists, and is in state active or inactive. 
Also, when it finds multiple valid targets, it randomly chooses between then. 
With this you can, say, let a train switch between track A and B using a switch.
Next to that, opposed to the standard Q3 implementation of the func_train, the ETF version has proper collision with entities, and will push them forward till they are crushed. Goalitems will return to their spawn position, in other words, go back to their inactive state.

-------- KEYS --------
dmg : amount of damage to do to players who block it (ETF-only).
speed : speed of displacement of train (default 100 or overridden by speed value of path).
target : this points to the first path_corner of the path which is also the spawn location of the train's origin.
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of the train's brush(es) and .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
1. Trains always start on in the game.
2. Trains do not damage the played when blocked.
3. Trains cannot emit sound.
4. Trains are not triggerable or toggle-able.
5. Trains cannot be block-stopped just by getting in their way, the player must be wedged between the train and another obstacle to block it.

Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

/*QUAKED path_corner (.5 .3 0) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
Modified for ETF

target : point to next path_corner in the path.
targetname : the train following the path or the previous path_corner in the path points to this.
speed : speed of func_train while moving to the next path corner. This will override the speed value of the train.
wait : number of seconds func_train will pause on path corner before moving to next path corner (default 0 - see Notes).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Free for all&quot; and &quot;Tournament&quot; modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in &quot;Teamplay&quot; and &quot;CTF&quot; modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
Setting the wait key to -1 will not make the train stop on the path corner, it will simply default to 0.

&lt;/pre&gt;

== More to explore ==

This section discusses additional noteworthy features of ETF mapping (not just related to entities) and provides links to further online resources.

=== Compiling with q3map2 ===

Here is the complete manual to q3map2: [[Q3Map2]]

Make sure you use  &lt;code&gt;-fs_game etf&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;-game et&lt;/code&gt; and  &lt;code&gt;-custinfoparms&lt;/code&gt; switches on each phase of the compile (bsp, vis, light)

Example of a .bat used to compile etf_2stoned:
&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant-1.4\q3map_2.5.16\q3map2.exe&quot; -v -game et -fs_basepath &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET&quot; -meta -custinfoparms -fs_game etf &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET\etmain\maps\etf_2stoned.map&quot; &gt; compile-recent-bsp.log

&quot;C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant-1.4\q3map_2.5.16\q3map2.exe&quot; -fs_basepath &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET&quot; -fs_game etf -game et -vis -saveprt &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET\etmain\maps\etf_2stoned.map&quot; &gt; compile-recent-vis.log

&quot;C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant-1.4\q3map_2.5.16\q3map2.exe&quot; -fs_basepath &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET&quot; -fs_game etf -game et -light -fast -q3 -samples 2 -bounce 8 -dirty -patchshadows -shade -v &quot;D:\Games\Wolf-ET\etmain\maps\etf_2stoned.map&quot; &gt; compile-recent-light.log
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Decompiling BSPs into map files ===

A good way to learn is to examine how specific map features are implemented in an existing map. With the q3map2 tool included with GtkRadiant, you can take a .pk3 archive with the map, extract it and decompile the contained BSP file into a .map file:

&lt;pre&gt;
q3map2.x86 -convert -format map -game et -fs_basepath /path/to/enemy-territory/etf /path/to/etf_map.bsp
&lt;/pre&gt;

The created etf_map_converted.map file is suitable for viewing with GtkRadiant or a text editor.

=== Particle system ===

ETF includes a particle engine for making light effects, sparks, etc. To add a source of particles to your map, create an entity like the one in the example below:

&lt;pre&gt;
{
    &quot;classname&quot; &quot;misc_particlesystem&quot;
    &quot;origin&quot; &quot;8 0 80&quot;
    &quot;script&quot; &quot;spirit/maps/muon_blue_sparks.spirit&quot;
    &quot;dir&quot; &quot;90&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &quot;script&quot; attribute refers to a script file in one of the *.pk3 archives available to the game engine. To see examples, extract the *.spirit files contained in the pk3s shipped with ETF.

This &quot;jolly good&quot; dessert was originally created in an old London bakery.{{fact}} At one point in time it was very popular throughout all of England.{{fact}} It has now has spread throughout Europe and the Americas, especially the north-east region of North America{{fact}} (with Bostonians having developed a particular liking for it).{{fact}} The ingredients are simple, the time it takes to prepare is short, and the dessert is simply delicious!

== Ingredients ==
* 2 bananas, peeled and sliced
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 2 tablespoons melted butter
* 1 refrigerated can of cinnamon rolls
* 1 cup caramel topping (similar to sundae toppings)
* 2-3 cups vanilla ice cream '''(optional)''' 

== Procedure ==
# Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
# In a small bowl, combine bananas, vanilla, and melted butter, until bananas are well coated. On a cookie sheet, unroll two cinnamon rolls, leaving the two triangles attached to form a square. Place 1/4 of banana mixture in the center of each pair of rolls.
# Bake for 11 to 13 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Heat the caramel topping and drizzle over dessert. Serve warm. It can also be served with a side dish of ice cream if one chooses.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Scientia. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Scientia~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ensiform. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ensiform~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

I do not know how to say this politely, so I ask as best I can, why are you working on this?  Wikibooks is not a site for game guides, this is a place for instructional books, educational works, annotated public domain books, things which can be used in a classroom.  Try as hard as I can, I can think of very few situations where what you are doing can be used to educate.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 01:59, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Some Ways to Keep a Meaningful Journal  ==
 
Anyone, at any moment, could walk up to you and tell you the meaning of life.  For everyone it may be different, but regardless of this fact, '''if''' the very next person you were to hold a conversation with were to divulge to you the secret meaning of the universe, chances are you probably wouldn’t understand it at the time.  Meaning is a product of contemplation, and contemplation is something of an aging process; things that start out as simply memorable mature into encounters that are truly meaningful.

A good journal is like a roadmap, a golden thread through the labyrinth of one’s own personal past.  A journal that is kept well and tended well will be fruitful, whereas one that is neglected and kept up out of a false sense of obligation, without any real thought put into it, will not yield any fruit to its writer.

In any Barnes &amp; Noble, Border’s, or even artsy boutique, blank books are a popular item for sale.  People like blank books, people buy blank books, but do people use blank books?  For me, getting to the very last page of any sort of notebook, no matter what it’s filled with, is a very special moment.  At that moment, I come to the realization that what’s in the front of the book is probably mature, so that I can read back over what I’ve written in the beginning and see how my attitude has changed.  A good journal will be rewarding in the writing process and also (especially!) during the re-reading process.  Remember, a journal is for '''you''', and no-one else but you!  So, there's no excuse not to be as honest as possible!

Keeping a journal can improve your happiness, according to academic research, although what you write is important. Negative events in your life may be best written about in analytical fashion, i.e. as an attempt to identify why events unfolded as they did (because writing analytically will increase awareness about external factors that caused the negative event, and thus suppress negative personal feelings). Positive events, on the other hand, might be better off when left unanalyzed, because analyzing could give the journaler awareness of external factors which contributed to the success).  It might be better instead for the writer to simply record the feelings of the moment and attempt to relive the positive events.

One of the most important things for a prospective journaler to remember is that the real value of a journal is the record being created; a proper journal can serve as a set of minutes to life, and so it comes down to the writer to decide what events are worth noting.  Even entries that seem incredibly mundane, filled with details that don't seem to change much from day to day can be interesting years later, and the real key can be establishing a habit of introspection and recollection at the end of each day.  That way, when something that is out of the ordinary and calls for real consideration occurs, the writer already has a set time and method to confront the issue.

=== Exercise ===

Now that everyone is good and inspired, here are a few tips to get started:  At the end of each day, pick one thing that sticks out in your mind.  This thing can be a situation, a person, a feeling, or any other kind of observation.  Pick something that is meaningful to you, and reflect honestly on it—half a page is a good starting length, but eventually you’ll come to have a certain sense of when an entry is completed.  At first this may seem difficult, but there are only 2 key points here- being perceptive, and being honest.

The writing part of keeping a journal is not a time-consuming ordeal-- IF the entry is something that you keep at the back of your mind throughout the whole day.  The cultivation of this attitude is one more beneficial side effect of keeping a journal.  Every day is at least a little bit different, and it is these differences, and moreover our '''reactions''' to these differences, that shape how we live life and experience the world.

== Keeping a diary ==

In order to keep a diary, you must set aside time each day to do so. An ideal time to do this is just before you go to bed. As well as adding the events of the day to your journal, the most important things you could write are your feelings and how events have made you feel.
This can be useful to look back upon, and honest, open diary entries can help you through difficult times.

Mainly working on:

[[Final Fantasy VI]] -&gt; Just about finished, needs media content and tables

[[Quest for Glory]] -&gt; Wide scope of project since there are 5 games in the series, overview and tips may be best.

[[Chrono Trigger]] -&gt; Best game ever, exhaustively researched and evaluated by now, largely want a clear and complete guide. All the info is there, but it could use some more media content and perhaps some more introduction/explanation. Importing the character pages might help too.</text>
