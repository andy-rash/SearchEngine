Moving the camera can be one of the best ways to portray emotion within cinematography. Different styles can represent different emotions, for example:
* A shaky camera could represent news footage or large movements
* Large flyovers (Helicopter/Jib) may represent large distances or a higher angle - ie: looking down on your subject.


==Preface: The operator is more important than the equipment==

It's easy to think that buying or hiring expensive equipment will just yield great camera movements naturally; however, this isn't the case.  When using specialized gear such as a Steadicam or any sort of airborne device, it is advised that an experienced operator is hired. Although it is possible to hire grip equipment for relatively little money, do not fall into the trap of using inexperienced operators as you'll make a better film if you keep your shots simple rather than use an inexperienced operator on an exotic bit of grip equipment. 

Learning a piece of equipment without guidance can also be harmful to a production. Learning incorrectly is a good way to learn bad shortcuts and habits. It is also an extremely easy way to break expensive equipment such as a hib.

=Techniques and Equipment=

==Handheld==
[[File:Cloverfieldwarning.jpg|thumb|right|A sign warning customers about side effects relating to [[wikipedia:motion sickness|motion sickness]] due to the shaky camera technique being used in ''[[wikipedia:Cloverfield|Cloverfield]].'']]
Handheld camera movements can provide specific tones and emotions to a viewer. In found footage films such as [[wikipedia:Chronicle_(film)|Chronicle]] or [[wikipedia:Cloverfield|Cloverfield]], the shaky camera effect is used to represent a home video effect. A handheld and slightly shaking camera can give extra intensity to action sequences and can also give a documentary-drama-like feel to a movie.

There are several options for creating handheld camera movements, some of these include:
* Using a shoulder or handheld rig.
* Giving a camera to an actor while running or other moving shots.
* Just going vanilla and holding the camera.
* Adding a camera shake in post.

There are many pros and cons to using Shaky camera movements in a shot, a balance should be found between both.
===Pros===
* Hide continuity errors
* Adds to emotion and intensity of scene
* Can add a certain &quot;Believability&quot; to a shot.

===Cons===
* Prone to motion sickness.
* Effects are harder to integrate.
* Harder to hide crew and other equipment.
* rest call sharon

==Dolly==
[[Image:Circular track.jpg|thumb|300px|A dolly mounted on circular track.]]

A dolly is a filmmaking tool used generally to get moving shots along a 1 dimensional plane. For example, a shot moving down a hall or moving towards a subject may use a dolly. A dolly generally consists of a cart which will hold the camera and perhaps the camera operator and may run on a track. If the camera operator is on the cart, a grip may be needed to move the dolly. This person is rightfully named the &quot;dolly grip&quot;. 

There are many variants of a dolly, some of these include:
* Circular Dolly - Circular track designed for Dolly cart.
* Tripod Dolly - Designed to attach to the bottom of tripods.
* Spider Dolly - Designed by Zach &quot;Final Cut&quot; King - [http://finalcutking.com/diy-spider-dolly/ Designs].
* Pico Flex Table Dolly '''&amp;reg;''' - A table dolly similar to the Spider Dolly.
* Wheelchair - A wheelchair is a popular alternative they can be found cheap on auction sites. 

Dollies are a popular alternative to a tripod as it can provide interesting shots and don't need specialised operators to run however the dolly and track can take time to set up and operators are needed to run the camera and cart.

Sliders are virtually a small dolly. They usually sit on a tripod and can be operated by a servo or manually. Sliders are generally used when a dolly isn't practical to set up or the shot doesn't need to move too much, for example; time lapses and shots of a smaller subject.

==Jib / Crane==
A Jib or Camera Crane is essentially a camera mounted on a crane arm. The crane arm is usually rested on a flat platform such as a tripod, but can is also found on dollies, vehicles and even a SteadiCam. Crane shots are often considered to add &quot;production value&quot; and are often used for establishing shot for this reason. At the base of the jib arm, weights provide a counter balance to the camera allowing the operator to create streamlined movements without exerting unnecessary force. At the base of the Jib arm the operator controls pan, tilt, zoom and focus. In his/her control panel the operator views the camera's digital output via a monitor - when shooting in film the monitor will show the image from the gate.

Jibs are often used in live television as they are versatile enough to cover a wide area with a single camera from a wide variety of depth and angle. The Director of Photography (DP) may employ the use of the jib to achieve smooth movements across crowds and/or stages. On smaller jibs, a pan/tilt head may be used and operated mechanically via metal wires. Focus is pulled via a wireless mechanism or smaller focal lengths with a larger f/stop may be used to increase Depth of Field.

In larger Camera Cranes, the head and arms may be operated via a joystick or programmed via a computer. Focus is also pulled the same way, but external field monitors will be connected either wirelessly or wired. Because of this, jibs are often expensive, the smaller amateur jibs starting from $500USD and the price only increase with the with the Hollywood jibs running in at many thousands of dollars.

===Tripod Jib===
A low-cost way to recreate small jib moves with a basic tripod is to fold down the front leg and push forward the camera and pan upwards. The camera altitude will drop, creating a jib movement forwards. 

==Other Stablisers==
[[Image:Steadicam Operator John Fry with Master Steadicam &amp; Arri Alexa camera.jpg|thumb|The larger Steadicams are designed to support 35&amp;nbsp;mm film and digital cinema cameras (like this Arri Alexa) and even IMAX cameras.]]
There are a few other stabilisers on the market, some of which use a counterbalance on the bottom.

===SteadiCam and alike===
The Steadicam was a big breakthrough in stabilisation for a cinematographer. It was developed in 1976 by Garret Brown and it used a counterbalance system at the bottom which was used to isolate operator inconsistencies. When using a vest, it can allow an operator to run through a set where the footage just seems to glide through.
====List of SteadiCam alternatives====
* artemis by Sachtler | inventor and designer: Curt O. Schaller
* FlyCam
* Glidecam
* Merlin (Gimbal Based)
* SteadiCam

====Tripod Alternatives====
A low-cost way to stabilise camera movement is to use the basic tripod as a makeshift steadicam.  Attach the camera to the tripod as usual, collapse and fold the legs together - (experiment with extending the legs a bit to increase stabilisation) and attach a small weight to the bottom of the legs. 2 or 3 pounds will be plenty as it doesn't need much. Some tripods are a bit heavier and may not require any additional weight at all.  The idea here is to hold the rig so that the camera is above your hand and the weighted legs are far below.  You want the camera to be able to swivel around freely. Loosening up all of the adjustment handles may help keep things a bit smoother.

===Shoulder Rigs===
Shoulder rigs are another stabilisation tool which generally rests on the shoulders of the camera operator. It allows an operator to get into the action with a degree of stability. It's not as smooth as Steadicam, but some would argue that it is more natural.

==Aerial Motion==
===Suspension cables===
Suspension cables are an interesting concept for faster moving action around a set area. They are mainly used in sporting arenas because all the cables can be attached onto supports. This makes it difficult to use in the field as supports have to be erected or attached to strong trees or structures.

===Copters===
Helicopters are a logical choice for aerial photography and videography as they aren't too hard to learn and can provide amazing imagery. Helicopters can be extremely hard to manoeuvre in windier weather and in tighter locations.

Quadcopters and copters with more rotors provide more stability and more lift to carry heavier equipment. These also make it easier to operate in less than better weather. 

===Helium balloon===
One method of obtaining an aerial shot is tying your camera or a plate to a group of helium balloons, which then floats above the scene that is to be filmed. The disadvantage of this includes that the camera will often face the wrong way and that too many balloons may cause the camera to drift away with the wind. 

Weather balloons can also be used as an alternative and space flight has been achieved with GPS being used to locate the camera after although stock footage can be used instead and is relatively cheap.

===Stabilizers===
In aircraft and other aerial shots, an external stabilizer might have to be used. This may include a Gyro or certain capsules that offer stability.

==Motion Control==
Motion control is when the camera movement is able to be exactly duplicated. Motion control is often used in shots in effect shots that need to align exactly or shots that are just too intricate to be completed manually. Motion control rigs are generally expensive and require specialists to program in movements and to make sure the rig functions correctly</text>

=Polarisers=

Light moves through the air in waves. These waves actually have an orientation in space. They can move horizontally, or vertically or any angle in between. This angle is known as polarization. 

For the most part polarization does not matter to a photographer, any polarization will expose the recording medium the same way, but when a polarizing filter is employed it allows one to select which polarization of light is allowed to enter the camera. The practical upshot of this is that a polarizer can:

* Enhance saturation. 
* Remove reflections and glare.
* &quot;See through&quot; humid air.

==Linear vs Circular==
Circular and linear polarizers for imaging applications are virtually the
same in how they function in polarization effectiveness and image quality.
After all, the circular polarizer is at its heart a linear polarizer to
which has been added a clear retarder layer that makes it into a circular
polarizer. The retarder does not degrade the image in any noticeable way.

General imaging rule of thumb...a linear polarizer has many applications but
may not work best in all...a circular polarizer can be used in any
application. When in doubt, go circular.

If your viewfinder has a partially silvered mirror or prism in it, it may be
susceptible to being hard to see through with a linear pol. Check your
manual for this equipment, as it may be an issue.

==Shooting angles==
The key issue you face is in panning with a polarizer in general, realizing
that it doesn't matter whether it's circular or linear. The degree of
polarization effect changes as you change your angular direction relative to
the sun in the sky. So if you are panning to follow a plane as the angle
changes the sky will go from lighter to darker and back again. This may (or
may not) be visually objectionable. The way to minimize this is to try to
set up your shots, as much as possible, so that the camera's viewing angle
stays perpendicular to the line-of-sight of the sun in the sky. This will
maximize the sky-darkening effect. If you find that your pan causes too much
change in the sky, then turn the polarizer so that it isn't at maximum
effectiveness so that the image will be improved but not be so dramatically
different from where it isn't affected at all.

Note that either type of polarizer has no effect when aimed directly toward
or away from the sun. And that you need a blue sky to start with...and that
you want to be sure that the change in sky darkness is not causing your
camera to change exposure as you pan...you will want to use the recommended
filter factor for exposure compensation with a fixed iris if that is
otherwise acceptable for your situation. Typical pols use a 1-2/3 stop
increase.

=Shot, Scene and Sequence=

==Shot==
A '''shot''' is the basic unit of a film and refers to one length of continuous (unedited) action.

While shooting, a shot is created when you turn the camera on (begin recording) and then turn it off.  Often, a director will record multiple '''takes''' (attempts) of each shot in order to get one perfect take to be edited into the final film.

While editing, a '''shot''' refers to the action between two adjacent edit points.

A shot can be as short as a single frame of film (1/24th second) to many minutes long -- both extremes are uncommon.  Action sequences tend to use many short-duration shots to increase the sense of excitement, while dramatic scenes tend to use longer-duration shots.

The components or elements of a shot can be divided into two categories: cinematography and mis-en-scene.  Cinematography is the way the shot is recorded by the camera, including such factors as lens selection, focus setting, depth-of-field, zoom, camera movements, etc.  Mis-en-scene refers to everything seen or heard within the shot: the performances, lighting, the set or environment, wardrobe, etc.

==Scene==
A ''scene'' is action that takes place at a certain place and time in the story.  If a film starts with a conversation in the kitchen and then cuts to the subway, the kitchen is one scene and the subway is another.  A scene can be composed of one shot or any number of shots.  When shooting, a director will often record a '''master shot''' which captures the entire scene in a single shot, and then record additional shots (e.g., close-up's, cut-ins and cut-aways) to be edited into the scene.

==Sequence==
When a number of scenes can be considered as a unit where the action continues or progresses along each of the scenes, then it is considered a '''sequence'''.

==Points of Confusion==
Scene and shot are sometimes used interchangeably. This will mean that in the script, individual shots may be referred to as scenes. Production staff may refer to a single take as a shot but refer to the shot by its scene number. So don't be too confused when production staff flip back and forth when describing a scene or a shot.

=Types of Camera Angles=
==Objective==

As opposed to subjective, objective shots are not seen from anyone (or anything's) eyes, but rather from an 'observer's' point of view. This supposed observer is, as far as the narrative is concerned, not actually there; that is, the characters cannot see or interact with the camera. (It can therefore, for example, pass through the glass of a window without hindrance, though this would require special effects.) The majority of shots taken in film are objective.

==Subjective==

Subjective shots are taken from someone or something's point of view. It might, for example, display what one of the characters can see. Truly subjective (rather than Point of View) shots are rarely used, as they can be disorientating or alienating to the audience, especially if a character looks at or speaks to the camera. They are, therefore, generally only used when the effect it creates is explicitly desired.

A popular device in horror films is to use subjective shots from the monster or adversary's point of view. This makes it possible to let the audience know what the monster is doing, without revealing any information about the nature of the adversary, which heightens the tension.

A very good example of subjective shooting is in the film &quot;Cloverfield&quot; by J.J. Abrams. The entire film is shot from a subjective point of view, an observers video camera.

==Point-of-view==
Sometimes abbreviated to POV, a point-of-view shot is when the camera is positioned to record what a character in the film would be seeing from his perspective.

=Cutting=
'''Cutting''' is another word for '''editing''' which means assembling the film from all of the raw footage shot during production.  Aside from assembling shots into scenes, editing also includes significant audio work, including redubbing dialogue (when required), adding music and adding sound effects.

=Composition=
[[Image:Bg-framing2.jpg|thumb|200px|Examples of shot size (in one filmmaker's opinion)]]
Composition refers to the arrangement of visual elements within a shot. The three basic shot compositions in filmmaking are long-shot, medium-shot, and close-up.

The '''long-shot''' typically shows a significant amount of the setting or shooting environment.  If the performers are seen in a long-shot, they are typically small within the frame.

The '''medium-shot''' is perhaps the most commonly used shot and typically includes one or two performers.  Often, a medium shot of a single performer will show from their waist upward.

The '''close-up''' shows one particular detail, often a performers face, although it may show an object, like a clock.  Whatever is shot, a close-up fills the screen with that image.

There are no strict dividing lines between these kinds of composition. The image to the right is just one example.

Composition in filmmaking has many elements in common with composition in painting and still photography -- line, tone, color, texture, shadow -- although cinematography is unique in that the composition may change during the shot.  During the shot the camera may move, the lens may be adjusted, the performers may move -- all of which will change the composition of the shot.  A performer, for example, might start in a medium shot, but then walk toward the camera, ending in a close-up.

=Continuity=
'''Continuity''' is the characteristic of a scene whereby the action seems fluid and continuous, even though it is composed of a number of shots.  There are many ways that continuity can be broken -- which can be noticeable and therefore distracting to an audience.  For example, if the hero's clothes are dirty and bloody as he is walking through the doorway, but clean as he emerges from the building, that is a continuity error.  Another kind of continuity error can be caused by poor editing.  For example, a character might move to a chair and sit down in a long shot, and then we cut to a close-up and see the end of the character's sitting movement.  Depending on how these two shots are edited, it will either look like a continuous motion (good continuity), or you might see repeated action or a gap in action (poor continuity).  Many people enjoy picking out continuity errors in movies.  See http://www.moviemistakes.com/

Continuity errors are often the result of cutting for performance, where the editor pieces together shots that form the desired feel of the scene with little or no attention paid to background objects or actions that cause the errors.

'''Please note that much of this content is present in WikiPedia and we should try to consolidate the two.'''

The aspect ratio of a screen is its width-to-height ratio. Aspect ratio is independent of screen size. A television screen 14 inches wide and 10.5 inches high has the same aspect ratio of a television screen 25 inches wide and 18.75 inches high. This aspect ratio is 4:3, or 1.33:1 (1.33 times as wide as it is high).

When referring to the aspect ratio you generally refer either to the terms “4 by 3” or “16 by 9” for television; for film you refer to the aspect ratio as the numerical term, eliminating the decimal point and the “:1.” Therefore you would refer to 1.85:1 as simply ”one-eight-five.”

A topic related to aspect ratio is that of [[Movie Making Manual/Pixel aspect ratio|Pixel aspect ratio]]

Cinema and television screens have used a number of different aspect ratios over the years. The following are the common ratios in use today:

* 1.33:1 aka 4:3. Standard for non-widescreen television.
* 1.37:1 (aka “Academy Standard Flat”) This is the frame size of standard 35mm sound film when using 4 perferations. While no films are distributed in this format many projects are shot in 1.37:1 and matted (or cropped) horizontally to fit other aspect ratios.
* 1.66:1 (aka &quot;European widescreen&quot;) Matting the Academy Standard Flat on the top and bottom to achieve a wider aspect ratio derives this aspect ratio.  Super [[Movie Making Manual/16mm|16mm]] is natively 1.66:1.
* 1.77:1 (aka 16:9) This is the standard ratio for widescreen television and all HDTV formats.
* 1.85:1 (aka &quot;Academy Standard Flat Matted&quot;) This is one of two major projection formats in American cinema, derived from matting the Academy Standard Flat on the top and bottom to achieve a wider aspect ratio. This aspect ratio can be shot using a 3-perf 35mm camera without wasting any negative.  [[w:3-perf|3-perf]] 1.85:1 is becoming very popular again in this age of the [[Movie Making Manual-Digital intermediate|Digital intermediate]].
* 2.35:1 This is usually achieved by matting the 4-perf academy standard 35mm frame.  But this wastes a lot of the negative so many people prefer to shoot using matted [[Movie Making Manual/perf|3-perf]] or [[Movie Making Manual/perf|2-perf]] (2-perf was once known as Techniscope).  2-perf uses the least film but it's also the rarest so it's tough to find the cameras and the telecine facilities.
* 2.40:1 AKA Anamorphic. This is the widest format available for modern cinema. It uses standard 35mm sound film with the image squeezed horizontally using anamorphic lenses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What I'm missing here is some information on timeschedules. We're currently in a semi large project that has realy got difficultly with release management. Currently it's still under development and we're scheduled to our first release on 01 jan 2006. The daily practice is to release new changes into production (after testing in a deployement environment). This causes a lot of restlessness in the Production Environment and Developers and End-Users aren't realy able to focus on the bugs that are in the programs. A weekly delivery (let's say on Friday's) would take down the stress a lot and give End-Users and Developers/Analists a more predictable view on the process. I believe the article needs some more juice on this subject. It would help me a lot at least!

== itil release management ==

I'm sure there are some interesting models that could/should go into this wikibook: like itil releasemanagement and it's 5 phases.

== collecting pages into a book ==


Would it make sense to collect [[Release Management]], [[Collected Real-life Experiences]], [[Transwiki:Career domains in computer science]] (each of them, at the moment, a single-page &quot;book&quot;) into a single book?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:03, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

== IF we are going to have a discussion, first we must define our terms. ==


Primarily this article focuses on what I have always called Build Management, carried out by the Build Engineer.  When I think of Release Management I am looking for the ITIL definition of the subject as they seem to have co-opted the term if they did not invent it.  I have never heard the term used except by ITIL or those using their principles.  If I were an expert on the subject, I would provide some text along those lines, but if I was an expert on the subject I would not be reading a WikiBook.</text>

I've fixed several inaccuracies and added a little content. Most of this revolves around the functionality of the native API and how it works: for example, the NT and ZW calls are identical, stuff like that. I'm also wondering what the &quot;greater purpose&quot; of this page should / could / would be. 90% of it can be partitioned off into a section as &quot;System Architecture&quot;. I'd also love to see some comments on RPC and COM or other products that Windows offers. They deserve a place on this page, because they're darn hard to comprehend without a proper reference to work with.

:Yeah, there is alot more information that this book/page really should cover, and we just haven't had the time to add it. Let's definately add in some stuff about RPC and COM (although i don't think we need to go all nuts with COM+, DCOM, MTS, OLE, etc...) We can even section some of the material off into another page, if you think it's a good idea. If you don't want to do the dirtywork yourself, let me know what you want moved and where, and I will take care of it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:40, 28 June 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to Research==

Research can be an intimidating but rewarding process. It allows you to gain additional knowledge on a topic, assemble outside support, and provide credibility for your assertions.  

Creating a research paper can be divided into three main steps: finding sources, evaluating sources, and integrating sources. This section will provide instruction on each of these steps, along with additional links and information to guide you through the research process.

== Determine the Role of Research in Your Writing ==
Depending upon the purpose of the assignment, research can be used to accomplish many things. 

Whether you are writing to inform, persuade, or critique, research should be used in conjunction with your own ideas to support your thesis and your purpose. Do not let the research speak for itself.  You, the writer of the document, are the most important voice. You are using outside sources to support your thesis.  Therefore, let your comments, connections, objections, etc. play the strongest role in your paper. When you quote or paraphrase an outside source, always bring the paper back to your thoughts.

It is essential to use outside sources that are going to back up your argument. In many cases, researching will reveal evidence that might relate to the topic but does not support your side of the argument. Many assignments will ask you to acknowledge the other side of the argument, so be sure to research your topic thoroughly and from many angles.

For some assignments, outside research may not be necessary. Thus, in determining the necessary amount of research needed, first evaluate the topic of the assignment. For example, a paper that is based solely on one’s opinion will likely require much less research than one that covers a highly scientific subject. To be sure, always ask your instructor for specific instructions.

== Finding Scholarly Sources ==

Before you begin your search, it is important to know that sources are divided into two categories: primary and secondary sources.  Primary sources include original documents created by an author or group of authors such as historical documents, literary works, or lab reports.  They also include any field research you conduct on your own such as interviews, experiments, or surveys. Secondary sources are sources written about primary sources and include scholarly books and articles, reviews, biographies, and textbooks.   

Most often in academic writing, you will want to consult scholarly secondary sources along with any primary sources available. A scholarly source would be one that has been written by a professional in the field; the person may hold a doctoral degree or have a great amount of expertise in the field you are studying.  Oftentimes, an author's credentials will be listed as a footnote within the source, but if not, an Internet search may reveal whether the writer can be determined to be a scholarly author or one that has done a vast amount of research on the topic. The author of the source will always be an important consideration, as your view of the quality of the article may change depending upon the author's credibility. In addition, you must ask yourself whether your source is scholarly.

In many fields, there will be a number of academic journals or publications that deal with publishing scholarly articles related to the subject.  By discovering and accessing these journals, you can be sure that the piece from which you are quoting is a scholarly source.  Many universities pay fees in order to provide their students with access to these journals in their electronic form, and an even greater number of university libraries will shelve current and back issues of these journals.

Furthermore, conducting an Internet search of these journals and articles may prove fruitful.  Search engines such as Google offer the option of searching &quot;Google Scholar&quot; in order to access only these scholarly articles.  Finding these sources online, depending on the journal and the site, may require that you pay a fee to view the article.  This is where university libraries come in handy, as they offer free access to the same materials.  If you cannot access a university library, some clever hunting of the Internet may still yield what you are looking for at no cost.

Popular scholarly databases include:
* [http://library.mtsu.edu/libdata/page.phtml?page_id=32 Academic Search Premier]
* [http://muse.jhu.edu/ Project MUSE]
* [http://www.jstor.org/ JSTOR]
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ Entrez-PubMed]
* [http://www.mla.org/bibliography The MLA International Bibliography]
* [http://www.apa.org/psycinfo/ PsychINFO]
* [http://www.proquest.com/en-US/ ProQuest]
...and a large number of other options depending on your field of study.

== Evaluating Scholarly Sources ==
Now that you have found your sources, you must evaluate them. Evaluating sources becomes a major component of researching because the materials chosen will reflect upon ''your'' reputation. Aside from being able to find informative sources, a good researcher is also able to quickly assess the credibility of information. Through practice, this skill will come.

When setting out to write a research paper, there is a vast pool of information available, including books, newspapers, periodicals, reference works, and government documents. Included in this can be your own empirical data, obtained in interviews and surveys, but you will probably not need to use it all.  As important as it is to be able to find sources specific to your topic, it is equally vital to be able to correctly assess each source's credibility -- that is, how trustworthy, accurate, and verifiable the sources are. Due to the vast amount of information available on the Internet, it presents an especially interesting challenge in determining the credibility of sources. However, even when evaluating print sources, the same criticism should be maintained. 

You must also be aware of the author's possible bias.  Even the most credible sources may exhibit forms of bias, as most authors' past experiences will come into play. Bias is most likely to occur in controversial topics such as politics or religion, but is still likely to be present whenever an opinion is voiced.  The author's beliefs and experiences can thus affect the objectivity of the text. Another case may be when the author or publisher has ties to a special interest group that may allow him or her to see only one side of the issue. Lastly, make sure to evaluate how fairly the author treats the opposing viewpoints.  Complete objectivity is very difficult to attain in writing, but try to find sources that are not incredibly subjective.  Nonetheless, the most important thing is simply to be aware of possible biases so that you are not misled.

Here are four approaches to assessing the credibility of the sources you find.

===Evaluating Print Sources===
The fact that it's in print doesn't automatically make it a reliable source. When evaluating print sources ask yourself these questions:

'''Book'''
* '''''How old is it?''''' Research projects will have different requirements as to how old your sources can be. For example, when dealing with contemporary issues or a current controversy, using outdated sources will likely provide inaccurate information. For example, a book on euthanasia published in 1978 probably isn't the best choice. While the book may contain useful information for other projects, it does not make sense to use it when there are more current materials available.  
* '''''Who is the publisher?''''' Books published by a university press undergo significant editing and review to increase their validity and accuracy. When assessing a book published by a commercial publisher, be aware of vanity presses (companies that authors pay to publish their works, rather than vice versa). Also be cautious about using books labeled as &quot;self-published&quot; or books that are published by specific organizations (such as a corporation or a nonprofit group). 
* '''''Is the author objective?''''' Check biographical information included in the book, as well as other sources, to gather information about the author's background as a way of determining his or her stance on a particular issue. In addition, find out about his or her previous works, past professional experience, affiliations with groups or movements, current employment, and degrees or other credentials. 

'''Periodical'''
* '''''Is it a scholarly journal or a magazine?''''' Scholarly journals are almost always characterized by no advertisements, longer articles, and the requirement that authors cite the sources they use in writing their articles. Articles submitted to scholarly journals undergo substantial scrutiny by other professionals as a way to increase the clarity and accuracy of the information contained in them. Most scholarly journals are not sold on news-stands, but rather are circulated primarily among the academic community. In contrast, magazines are available for purchase; they tend to contain shorter articles, generally don't require writers to cite their sources, and contain advertising. Therefore, while magazines may contain relevant information, the content may not always be entirely accurate.
* '''''How old is it?''''' As noted above, dated material can sometimes be inaccurate. Always ask your instructor if you're uncertain about how old is too old.
* '''''Newspaper article: What do you know about the paper that publishes it?''''' Some newspapers have a discernible political slant, which can often be found by skimming through the headlines or by seeing how others regard the newspaper. For example, ''The Los Angeles Times'' is considered a more progressive news source, while its neighbor ''The Orange County Register'' is considered to have a libertarian slant.

===Evaluating Web Sources===

For most academic research, teachers will require that students use scholarly sources. For this there are a number of “academic databases” that will always provide credible sources. These sites generally require some form of a subscription in order to access them; however, many colleges provide complimentary access to students. Once logged into the site, users are able to search and sort the articles by criterion such as date, subject, author, and more importantly, whether or not they have been peer reviewed and are scholarly. Examples of these sites include, but are not limited to: EBSCO, JSTOR, and Proquest. Links to these “gated websites” can generally be found on your school’s web page. Nevertheless, always ask what databases are available to you as a student.

While the rest of the Internet has a wide range of easily accessible and useful information, discretion must be maintained. Because anyone can put information on the Internet, make it your first priority to know who is behind the sites you find. Individuals? Nonprofit groups? Corporations? Academics? Advocacy groups? Federal, state, or local government? Small businesses or single vendors? Depending on your topic, you may want to avoid dot-com web sites; for many, their primary purpose is commerce, and that can significantly affect what they publish. Of course, other websites can also have agendas. This can lead to false or misleading information. Therefore, it is best to consult a number of sources so that those with agendas will stand out. 

Ask yourself:
* '''By whom was the website created?'''  Be cautious if there is no author.  Try looking for &quot;about this site&quot; or check the homepage.  Does the website discuss the qualifications of the author(s)?  Does it give contact information such as an email address or telephone number?
* '''By whom is the website sponsored?'''  Determine whether the website is sponsored by a special interest group.  By learning about the affiliated groups, much can be ascertained about the credibility of the author and web site.  Also look at the domain name.  This will tell you by whom the site is sponsored.  For example: educational (.edu), commercial (.com), nonprofit (.org), military (.mil), or network (.net).
* '''Is the website relevant?'''  Decide whether the information is something that can actually be used in the paper or, at the very least, gives a helpful background. If what is found cannot be used, move on to something else. 
* '''Does the website contain any errors?'''  Can the definitions, figures, dates, and other facts presented on the website be verified in other sources?  Look for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and content errors.  If there appears to be more than one or two content errors, move on.   
* '''Is the website relatively unbiased?''' As it is noted above, carefully examining the source behind the website can lead to clues as to what kind of bias and agenda the site may contain. Once the source has been deemed valid, continue to remain alert, especially if the topic is controversial. Look for websites that discuss multiple points of view.  Take note of the language used, and avoid sites that seem to exhibit characteristics of bias and/or inaccurate information.
* '''Are there advertisements on the Web page?'''  Do these particular advertisements reflect a possible bias toward the subject matter?
* '''What appears to be the website's purpose?'''  Think about why the site was created.  Is its purpose to inform, persuade, or sell a product to the reader?  For whom was the site created?  Who is the intended audience?  If you are not included in the intended audience, carefully consider whether or not the information is relevant to your research.
* '''Is the website comprehensive.''' A valuable website will cover a topic in-depth and lead to additional sources.
* '''Does the website provide references?'''  Determine whether the references themselves are authoritative.
* '''How old is the website?''' A website that has remained on the Internet a long time may be better trusted than one that was added a month ago.  Make sure that the information is not outdated.  When was the site last updated? Credible websites will garner ongoing attention by their creators to make sure that the content is as up-to-date as possible.
* '''Has the website received any awards?'''  Websites that have received awards may have better reputations.
* '''Is the website user-friendly?''' Does the website download quickly?  Can you read all the text?  Does any text appear too small, in strange characters, or in a font that is illegible?  How easy is it to navigate through the website?  Is the content accessible?  The information presented should be clear, precise, and easy to understand. Avoid using sites that make use of overly scientific and/or technological terms that are difficult to understand. If it cannot be clearly understood, it may lead to misinterpretation and thus incorrect information in your work.

=== Consider Your Project ===
How you evaluate a source will differ depending on the project you're working on. When determining whether a source is credible, biased, or relevant, it is equally important to consider how the source will be used.

For example, [http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/policies_practices/ysp.asp Phillip Morris] has a web site that touts the company's programs to curb smoking among young people. Obviously, information from a tobacco company and cigarette marketing giant can be considered biased. You must ask yourself whether their program is effective and whether the content of the site can be trusted and in what context.

Should you never use that source? You might want to if you were writing a paper that examined the smoking rates of 10 - 13 year olds. What role might the Phillip Morris site play in your paper? Does the site display information that contradicts the company's advertising campaigns? Would the campaign website be effective in your argument? It all depends on what side of the argument is going to be supported in your research project. 

Audience. Purpose. Argument. These intents should be considered since they affect how sources should be evaluated.

=== Consult ADAM ===
When faced with assessing a large number of sources in a short period of time, the quickest way to cover the essential points is to remember this acronym:

* '''Age.''' How old is this source? For almost every topic, search for the most current sources that can be found.
* '''Depth.''' Does the source go in-depth, or does it just skim over the surface? Does it feature the many details and long discussions that are expected from academic sources, or does it just seem to cover the main ideas? Always use substantive sources.
* '''Author.''' Who is the author? What is known about his/her qualifications? Is he/she really an expert? Can any bias be seen? What is his/her purpose?
* '''Money.''' Follow the money. Is the source coming from a place that's trying to “sell” something? Is there advertising where this source appears that might affect what will be printed?

==Integrating Scholarly Sources==
To better understand the process of researching, it should be recognized that there are sources of information all around us. We commonly use them in situations ranging from a conversation with a friend to an online discussion.  The difference in academic research is that this “casual conversation” turns into a discussion with the readers of your paper. Therefore, it may help to think of doing research and using sources of information as just another way to enhance your conversation with the audience.   

=== Sources Are Other Voices === 
Even before you learn the rules of citation, recognize that you already know quite a bit about how to work with sources. It can be helpful here to think of sources as &quot;other voices.&quot; Sources are used when you reference an idea that was heard in a conversation. They are used when considering what to buy -- whether the source is an advertisement, a slogan you can't get out of your head, the fact that a friend recommended a product, or that you've looked up price quotes and shopped around. You become knowledgeable about making decisions by piecing together the information from many sources. Sources are part of our lives; they are all around us and are a part of how we breathe life into the words that express what we think.  

In research writing, it is similar in the sense that the same act of interacting with other voices is present, and only another layer is added. Because writing is being done, you're also presenting the sources in an organized way, so that your sources are used in a way that supports your point of view. This means that any and all sources that remotely relate to the topic can't be thrown in; instead, pick and choose the best sources for your purposes, and use them strategically for effect.

=== Purposes of Sources === 
Sources are capable of playing a variety of roles in your writing. Sometimes sources are used as examples; sometimes they present evidence. Sources can also be used to present a counter-argument. Other times, they are used only to be built upon and refined. Nevertheless, it should be realized that sources can serve multiple purposes in a paper.  

This is nothing new. To relate this to an everyday situation, try this: Spend a week paying attention to the conversations and discussions you have. Listen for sources used and try to discern for what reasons they were used. You'll often hear people cite the news or refer to a game when talking about sports. You'll hear friends quote conversations they've had with other friends. You will hear people discussing important issues with the participants in that discussion providing reasons (evidence) -- facts and opinions, but often a mix of the two -- for why they feel the way they do.

In writing, the natural act of conversing with and referring to others is taken one step further. Knowing in advance that you'll be writing for an audience, sources (other voices) will be looked at while exploring an idea and planning how to appeal to those readers, using terms and conventions that they will recognize. However, do not let this part of the research process get in the way of doing what comes naturally. Research is about curiosity and interest. It is about having something to say and finding the evidence to support it. That is the basis of research and working with sources. Thus, the technicalities and rules of research, while important, should not discourage you from doing research and effectively using sources.


== Cite Sources to Avoid Plagiarism ==
After using other sources to gain information for a report or paper, you might decide to use that information in your paper. If the ideas expressed in your paper are not your original thoughts, you must cite where you obtained that information. If you do not cite where you obtained your information, you are [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Plagiarism plagiarizing]. Plagiarizing is an extreme offense. If you are caught plagiarizing in school you usually will receive a failing grade on the assignment, if not in the entire course.  You could also risk being expelled from school. If you are caught plagiarizing in the workplace, it could likely end up costing you your job. If you are a researcher and plagiarize in a scientific paper, your university may lose funding.  To avoid the risk of plagiarism, make sure that you cite copied information! The most common forms of citation are direct [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Quotation_Marks quotations] and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Analyzing_assignments#Summary.2FResponse_Paper summarizing] or paraphrasing. After a direct quote or at the end of a summarized or paraphrased thought, you should cite the author and page number of your source. Information on how to cite sources can be found in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Citation The Writer's Handbook: Citations]. If you are using other sources in your report and are unsure whether or not you need to use citations, it is better to be safe than sorry, so cite the information.

The two most common standards for citing are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Language_Association MLA] (Modern Language Association) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APA_style APA] (American Psychological Association). Each is specific to the field in which the research is done. For example, if you are researching for a psychology class, it is most likely going to be cited in APA format. On the other hand, MLA is used in the liberal arts and humanities fields. Nonetheless, check with the teacher, group, or organization for which the research is being done to find out which method you are expected to use.

Using and correctly citing outside sources is hugely important to the ethical portrayal of you as a writer.  It shows that you have done your homework, literally. It also shows that you are a thoughtful writer who takes this work or subject seriously, who respects the hard work of others, and who truly contemplates the intricacies of research and discovering truth in writing.

== Proposed Conventions ==
&lt;small&gt;
This page describes proposed conventions that should be followed in editing this book. As a general rule, all guidelines from [[Wikibooks:Manual_of_Style]] are in effect. These conventions are not adopted / contested / resolved yet. Add and explain your proposals here and a warning on the main talk page of the book. Please remember to sign and date proposals.

Contributors come from many different countries and cultures, and have widely different views. By treating others with respect, we are able to cooperate effectively in building an instructional resource. Check [[Wikibooks:Etiquette]] for pointers.

Please do try to check responses to your post from time to time, if you think some action should be incorporated into the proposals and a given time of inactivity (7+ days is ok) is verified, move the relevant information to the proper location, or take any just action as justified by your post and archive the original thread...

Proposals (now inactive for more than 7 days) should be moved to the [[/Archive2|Archive2]] after some references are added to the proper '''proposal''' location.
&lt;/small&gt;

== humor ==

Humor should be encouraged in this book, because humor helps people learn.[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~slm/AdjCI/Startclass/Humor.html][http://iae-pedia.org/Using_Humor_to_Maximize_Learning]
Therefore, [[wiki:AlmostNeverDeleteHumor|AlmostNeverDeleteHumor]].

This allows this book to fill an empty niche: there is apparently no other humorous introduction to C++
(&quot;Does there exist a humorous C++ tutorial?&quot;[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3075264/does-there-exist-a-humorous-c-tutorial]),
even though such things exist for other languages.

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 18:10, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

:I would support a AlmostNeverDeleteHumor convention but not a convention that encourages humor. Even if similar the goals are different. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:03, 20 June 2010 (UTC)

:{{Support}} I personally think it is a fine idea to encourage some amount of humor amounts of humor. Some exceptions for off topic and inappropriate humor should be made though, those can be deleted.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 07:29, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
::The question here is the need to make humor a goal, I don't see it as a necessity and it somehow diverges from the scope of the book, that is not to be a humorous work. In any case I don't think there needs to be a convention about this at the moment, I will try to spice it a bit and respect the spirit of AlmostNeverDeleteHumor as I work on the book.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:36, 20 June 2010 (UTC)

::: I disagree, I think it is perfect for a convention.  As noted above it will improve the educational aspects of the book, and it is something editors may not realize is welcome, making it a prime candidate for a convention.  It is more of an issue of writing style then subject matter, so I don't really think that it diverges from the scope.  And as we all know, the name of the C++ language is itself a joke, but it really should have been named ++C. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:59, 20 June 2010 (UTC)

::: ''diverges from the scope of the book''? I think you misunderstand my proposal. Let me put it to you in the form of two syllogisms.
::: &quot;People learning&quot; is the goal of the C++ Programmming book.
::: Humor helps people learn.
::: Therefore, humor helps fulfill the goal of the C++ Programming book.

::: The Conventions page should encourage non-obvious things that help fulfill the goal of the C++ Programming book.
::: Humor helps fulfill the goal of the C++ Programming book.
::: It is not obvious that humor helps fulfill the goal of the C++ Programming book.
::: Therefore, the Conventions page should encourage humor.
::: --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 15:18, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: At this point of development of the book the convention should not encourage any change to the level of humor of the text. I'm not against adding funny quotes or mentioning funny situations or comical examples but at this stage of development creating grounds for inconsistency in the writing style shouldn't be encouraged nor does it need be specifically protected by a convention (as it wasn't one of the goals set for the project). To my knowledge no funny content has been killed on the production of this book.
:::: The concept is interesting, but with the level of participation in the book you can by action and by direct contact with the editors have better results that by the addition of a unenforceable and open ended call for humorous content, not all type of humor is proper, translatable across cultures and able to mix well with the scope of the book. The concept is interesting but as a proposal it wouldn't have any value, especially due to how the book has been written.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:23, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

== flat page structure ==

For years, the [[C++ Programming/Conventions]] page has said
: &quot;We are using the ''slash convention'' with a ''flat page structure'' as described in [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy]]&quot;.

Recently it has come to my attention that the Wikibooks naming policy no longer defines &quot;flat page structure&quot;, and so it is unclear what exactly that means.
We can't expect new editors to dig through the history of that policy to learn the definition of that term.

* ''flat page structure'' means that every &quot;module&quot; of the book after the title page has exactly one slash, of the form &quot;Book_Title/CHAPTER&quot;.
** For example, &quot;C++ Programming/Operators&quot;.
* ''deep hierarchical structure'' means that the the book is divided into chapters, which are introduced with a &quot;module&quot; of the form &quot;Book_Title/Chapter_Name&quot;, and each chapter is further divided into pages of the form &quot;Book_Title/Chapter_Name/Page_Name&quot;. Perhaps there is a larger grouping of chapters into a larger section, and further sub-divisions of the hierarchy, leading to any number of slashes.
** For example, &quot;C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators&quot;.

As best as I can recall, the above definition is equivalent to the definition of &quot;flat page structure&quot; that was once part of the naming policy, and is also equivalent to the definitions currently on [[Help:Editing#Subpage links]] and the [[Horticulture/Manual of Style]] and [[Using Wikibooks/How To Structure A Wikibook#Titles and Naming Conventions]].
(Those pages also list some advantages and disadvantages of the &quot;flat page structure&quot; vs &quot;deep hierarchical structure&quot;).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 17:24, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

:For years that convention was never fallowed, nor did I interpret it as &quot;flat structure&quot; or &quot;flat hierarchy&quot;. In any case I did yesterday spend time digging around on the subject and the only discussions I saw was on the Naming policy talk page (referring to that flat structure), if you are interested the first vote for the &quot;/&quot; convention was in 2005, I voted against and the vote didn't pass it was later approved in 1 March 2006, I didn't see on the approved text mention of flat whatever.
:[[Horticulture]] has now mixed structure, that book substituted the chess book that substituted the Ada Programming book (the original poster child for the flat structure). In fact today is extremely difficult to find any book of considerable size that still uses that structure and no new books are using it intentionally (all books start in a flat structure). I've confirmed that the C++ Programming never used or enforced the convention, or used that structure, beyond the initial days that I used a monolithic approach to the text. In fact the convention was never proposed or discussed (I have added the relevant link to it on the &quot;never&quot;), in violation to the decision policy.
:In any case what is the point of the above post ?  It doesn't seem to be a proposal.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:30, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

:: Silly me, I left out the actual proposal.
:: I propose adding a link to that convention that links directly to the definition of &quot;flat structure&quot; (and describes its advantage over the alternative), changing it to
::: &quot;We are using the ''slash convention'' with a ''flat page structure'' as described in [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy]] and [[Using Wikibooks/How To Structure A Wikibook#Titles and Naming Conventions]].&quot;
:: --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 19:06, 27 July 2010 (UTC)

::: I take by the first post that you aren't happy that the [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy]] never defined &quot;flat structure&quot; (this isn't the forum to change that). I also take that there are different concepts around what &quot;flat&quot; something is, even [[Using Wikibooks/How To Structure A Wikibook#Titles and Naming Conventions]] seems to be badly written as books can have a flat structure without including chapters in the navigational scheme created by the &quot;/&quot; convention (that was my understanding of &quot;flat pages&quot; on our convention, that section can be greatly improved and cover all possibilities) in any case it seems that the C++ Programming never had a &quot;flat structure&quot; and has in fact being moving to a highly structured hierarchical one, this practice seems to be the one chosen by most of the larger book. If the proposal is to revert the book to a flat structure, I'm not only opposed to it but sees it as removing the ability to fully enjoy the navigational aid provided by the &quot;/&quot; convention, in fact such flat structures create a need for external and hard to maintain navigational aids, hinder interconnection of the content, something that in the C++ language is extremely (even regrettably) necessary (for instance the {{C++ Programming/kw|static}} keyword has 4 distinct implications, without a deeply hierarchical structure it would be impossible not to duplicate content across several sections of the book (take a look at the static page content to see how we managed it).
::: In any case since the convention no longer mentions &quot;flat&quot; the need to the link no longer exists.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:06, 28 July 2010 (UTC)

:::: Are you proposing to change the convention from &quot;flat structure&quot; to something else? What structure would you prefer? Would you prefer a &quot;Book_Title/Chapter_Name&quot; plus &quot;Book_Title/Chapter_Name/Page_Name&quot; structure? Would you prefer a &quot;Book_Title/Section_Name&quot; plus &quot;Book_Title/Section_Name/Chapter_Name&quot; plus &quot;Book_Title/Section_Name/Chapter_Name/Page_Name&quot; structure? From [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Naming_policy&amp;oldid=1433568 2009] back to [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Naming_policy&amp;oldid=683955 2006] and probably earlier, the Wikibooks naming policy had a definition of &quot;flat structure&quot;. That definition was moved to the page that I mentioned before. Is there a page somewhere that defines the structure &quot;chosen by most of the larger book&quot; and its advantages?
:::: What structure are we aiming towards? I'd like to at first understand what it is. After that, I would like to learn its advantages.
:::: If some editor wants to add a page to this book, to what name should we move it? As far as I can tell, the C++ Programming book currently has an inconsistent structure. Therefore, it is not currently possible for me to make new page names that are consistent with the current page names.
:::: For example, let's say someone writes a page about bitor. Should we move it to
:::: C++ Programming/bitor
:::: C++ Programming/kw/bitor
:::: C++ Programming/Operators/bitor
:::: C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/bitor
:::: C++ Programming/Operators/Operator_Overloading/bitor
:::: C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/bitor
:::: C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/bitor
:::: C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators/bitor
:::: or perhaps somewhere else?
:::: --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:50, 30 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::There isn't a convention for &quot;flat structure&quot; anymore.
:::::We never used it, in the terms the majority seems to interpreter it now. In particular I don't like the idea of including the chapters in the path (hierarchy). Recently I did some changes that puts some pages in that type of hierarchy but it is only for structural consistency and navigability.
:::::Examples:  [[C++ Programming]] -&gt; [[C++ Programming/Chapters]] -&gt; [[C++ Programming/Chapters/C++]] -&gt; [[C++ Programming/Chapters/C++/Summary]] or [[C++ Programming/Chapters/C++/Print Version]]  (and made use of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:C++ Programming]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 for the chapters pages)
:::::It seems to me that given the actual arrangement it would be C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/bitor (since even if MS defines them as macros) they are indeed keywords (this is covered in [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators/Logical Operators|Logical Operators]]) and would be used in the rest of the book with the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{C++ Programming/kw|bitor}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
:::::My experience dictates that most editors will never have problems with the page structure, since most will add to the already existing pages and forgo getting into that type of issues, and if confused will just ask or create it on the root, as indeed the book has now requirements of structure and order/organization/low that requires specific considerations when adding significative content. To make large structural changes would require one to have a good understanding of the already existing content and structure and most editors will not have the time or inclination to learn about it.
:::::I've been also thinking on the concept of a &quot;humorous&quot; book on C++, the viability not of altering this one but on creating a derivation that indeed has humor as a goal. I'm game for the creation of a derivation of the C++ Programming book with that goal, if it will follow the same content structure and will only reuse the content already present of this book, that is primary contributions will have to benefit the C++ Programming first.
:::::It will not consist of a duplication of content (as it will have a distinct voice and focus on humor) nor a duplication of effort since the priority will be to extend the source material first. I propose the title of &quot;A cynics view on CPP&quot; (being the PP intentional as to provide fodder for jokes).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 12:03, 30 July 2010 (UTC)
:::::I also call your attention to [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme‎]] Request for Deletion (since it relates to the historic relevance of the hierarchical structure of Wikibooks) you may wish to participate on the discussion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 13:29, 30 July 2010 (UTC)

:::::: Dear C++ Wikibook editors,
:::::: This book currently has modules with names like &quot;C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators&quot;.
:::::: Let me call it the &quot;6 slash structure&quot; for now, to distinguish it from the &quot;Book_Title/Chapter_Name/Page_Name&quot; structure. Is there a better name for the 6 slash structure?
:::::: Is there any description of the 6 slash structure anywhere online?
:::::: (I honestly don't know any good reason for redundantly mentioning &quot;C++&quot; twice in the name, but I assume Panic has at least one good reason for doing that).
:::::: Panic seems like a pretty smart guy, so I'm assuming the 6 slash structure has some slight advantage over the &quot;Book_Title/Chapter_Name/Page_Name&quot; structure for the C++ Wikibook.
:::::: Therefore, I propose updating this convention page to mention the structure this book is *actually* using -- something like
::::::: &quot;We are using the ''slash convention'' as described in [[Wikibooks:Naming_policy]], with a ''6 slash structure'' as described in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[...]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&quot;
:::::: --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 18:45, 9 August 2010 (UTC)


:::::::The rational not the use Chapter_Name in the &quot;path&quot; is that it would prevent to easily move pages from chapter to chapter or restructuring chapters (for instance we have a clear unbalanced chapter structure at the moment). I foresee a need to at a later date reshape them, it all depends on the level of content and how it is expanded.
:::::::A similar issue is created by fixing the number of the depth of the path, we can easily use more.
:::::::I think that the issue or problem you see is that you are putting too much value on the pages names and location these are highly volatile and don't need to really express the content, take for instance the page that is causing you confusion the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++]]. It is a given that all pages should start by Book_Title, that is unavoidable and doesn't need to be stated. Pages not named so would fall outside of the project namespace (but exceptions can be created as for example in the issue about tables you have risen not so long ago). I don't see an issue on putting them on a special namespace or using the Template namespace if no one objects. In this particular case the path order is not in accordance to the book structure, this is the first page of content of the book but the order reflects the use of the slash convention as a necessary aid to navigation (we in the past have tested navigational Templates, but found that they are extremely hard to maintain and create unnecessary attrition regarding esthetics and technical accessibility.
:::::::The conventions do not necessary need to reflect every detail, they should only be used to prevent conflict and ease participation, if extremely detailed and complex they can even become a barrier to participation. Beyond this discussion there never was any issue about the structure (path order, there were several request against the previously monolithic structure, and on the order the content was presented). I wouldn't see an issue if someone just ignored the path structure and created pages on the root of the book. I do value more the content someone can provide to the ability and time they can spare to understand our structure or even fallow our conventions, the content can always be moved and made to conform to the general practice.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:19, 9 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The image on the right shows a box made out of 6 business cards. These boxes can be easily made in a couple of minutes (once you have made the first one).

They are a great way to amuse people and there is almost always someone in reach who has some spare business cards. These cubes are based on the design from [http://www.nedbatchelder.com/text/cardcube.html Ned Batchelder].

The first step is to fold 6 cards in the following way. Place one card on top of another in the shape of a cross and then fold the overhanging parts over the other card. 

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
The next step it to place these 6 cards together so they all hold themselves in a box shape. You can tell if you have done it correctly because you can throw the box in the air and then catch it in one piece.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
If you cut a notch out of the edge of the cards you can make a square with a corner cut off that you can balance it on a corner. 

If you fold in the notch you can make also balance the cube.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;
If you fold in all the corners you come up with something like a ball. You can make a larger ball by joining together squares and triangles.

==Telling the time==
In Old English, time was often told using real-world references, like we would do when we say &quot;It's midday&quot; or &quot;It's noon&quot; or &quot;It's midnight&quot;. Clock time was probably used mostly in monasteries (one of whose jobs it was to keep track of such time) and perhaps also other institutions - not so much by the common people; but it was known of. In Old English, they counted from about 6 o'clock as zero hour when telling the time (so 9 o'clock was the third hour), but you could just use the modern standard practice.

Common time-of-day references:
*Hit is ǣrmorgen - It's early morning (before 6 o'clock)
*Hit is prīm - It's about 6 o'clock in the morning
*Hit is undern - It's about nine o'clock in the morning
*Hit is middæġ - It's midday
*Hit is nōn - It's noon (about 3 o'clock in the afternoon)
*Hit is ǣfen - It's evening (late in the day)
*Hit is niht - It's night-time
*Hit is midniht - It's midnight 

Otherwise, one could just say something which in Modern English would literally be translated &quot;It the the (x)th hour (of the morning/after midday). Although they used 6:00 as zero-hour in OE times, I will here used the modern standard practice of counting from midnight:
*Hit is sēo seofoðe tīd morgenes - It's 7:00 AM
*Hit is sēo nigoðe tīd morgenes - It's 9:00 AM
*Hit is sēo þridde tīd æfter midæge - It's 3:00 PM\

&quot;Prica&quot; (weak masculine gender) was a useful word which was used to mean both &quot;quarter of an hour&quot; or &quot;a fifth of an hour&quot;. You could use to to show much before or after a particular hour it was, like in Modern English. I will here use it to mean &quot; a quarter of an hour&quot;, since that is what we do these days:
*Hit is prican ofer þǣre ōðerre tīde - It's quarter past two
**(Notice that &quot;prica&quot; is used in dative - this is because it is here used actually like an adverb, to modify the preposition &quot;ofer&quot;, so it needs to be declined)

==Time words==
*time - sēo tīd, se tīma
*year - þæt ġēar
*season - se tīma
*month - se mōnaþ
*week - sēo wucu
*day - se dæġ
*hour - sēo tīd
*space of time, interval - þæt fæċ
*clock - þæt dæġmǣl

==Saying age==
In Old English, one could say age either like Modern English &quot;I am twenty&quot; (with no &quot;year&quot;) or &quot;I am twenty years (old)&quot;, but you could also use &quot;winter&quot; to show age. The words &quot;ġēar&quot; and &quot;winter&quot;, if included, would be in the genitive, which would literally mean, for example, &quot;of x years (of age)&quot; (e.g. &quot;Iċ eom twentig wintra&quot; - &quot;I am of twenty winters (of age&quot;)

Here's how to do it:
*Iċ eom þrittiġ - I'm thirty
*Hē is twā and twentiġ ġēara - He is twenty-two years old
*Hēo is þrēo and fēowertig wintra - She's forty-three years old

==Days of the Week==
To say what day of the week it was, one would say, for example:
*Hit is Mōnandæġ - It's Monday

These are the names of the days of the week:
*Mōnandæġ
*Tīwesdæġ
*Wōdnesdæġ
*Þunresdæġ
*Friġedæġ
*Sæternesdæġ
*Sunnandæġ

==Months of the Year==
One would say what month it was similarly to Modern English:
*Hit is se Ǣrra Līða - It's June

The months are:
*January - se Æfterra Gēola, Ianuarius (Latin: se Ianurius)
*February - se Solmōnaþ Februarius (Latin: se Februarius, þæs ~i)
*March - se Hrēþmōnaþ, se Hlȳdmōnaþ, se Hlȳda, Martius (Latin: se Martius)
*April - se Ēastermōnaþ, Aprēlis (Latin: se Aprilis)
*May - se Þrimilċemōnaþ, se Þrimilċe, Maius (Latin: se Maius)
*June - se Sēremōnaþ, se Ǣrra Līða, Iunius (Latin: se Iunius)
*July - se Mǣdmōnaþ, se Æfterra Līða, Iulius (Latin: se Iulius)
*August - se Wēodmōnaþ, Agustus (Latin: se Agustus)
*September - se Hāligmōnaþ, se Hærfestmōnaþ, Septembris (Latin: se September)
*October - se Winterfylleþ, Octobris (Latin: se October)
*November - se Blōtmōnaþ, November (Latin: se November)
*December - se Gēolmōnaþ, se ǣrra Gēola, December (Latin: se December)

Notice that January and February, and June and July, have similar names, except that they have either &quot;se Ǣrra&quot; or &quot;se Æfterra&quot; prefixed to them? That's because they were once considered to be joined together. To refer to them joined together, use the words:
*June and July together - se Līða
*December and January together - se Gēola

Also, in the calendar used in Old English times, the extra day of a leap year was not added to February. Instead, it was put between &quot;se Ǣrra Līða&quot; and &quot;se Æfterra Līða&quot;. It was called &quot;Þrilīða&quot;, but using it would cause difficulties because it wouldn't fit well with the modern calendar.

==Seasons of the Year==
*Spring - (se) lencten - (from February 7 to May 8)
*Summer - (se) sumor - (from May 9 to August 6)
*Autumn - (se) hærfest - (from August 7 to November 6)
*Winter - (se) winter - (from November 7 to February 6)

==How to Tell Dates==
In the Anglo-Saxon Chronical, shorthand [[/Calendar|dates]] are written off to the side of the page using a fairly international style taken from Latin. However, it is not entirely clear how this was read aloud. There examples of written &quot;natural speech&quot; dates in Old English. Natural speech dates in Old English were quite straightforward and conformed to normal grammatical rules unlike our commonly abbreviated spoken date format in Modern English, like this:

*Hit is se nigoða dæġ Hlȳdan þæs hundtēontigoðan ġēares - It is the ninth of March, 100 AD
**Literally, &quot;It is the ninth day of March of the hundredth year&quot;
*Hit is se tēoða dæġ Lenctenes - It's the tenth day of spring
*Iċ ēode þider on Hlȳdan þæs þūsendoðan nigon hundtēontigoðan nigon and nigontigoðan ġēares - I went there in March 1999
**Notice that the year is read a full ordinal number, like in Modern English &quot;one-thousand nine-hundred and ninety-ninth year&quot; rather than the normal Modern English practice &quot;nineteen ninety-nine&quot;

==Holidays==
*All Saint's Day - (se) ealra hālgena dæġ
*Christmass Day - (sēo) Crīstes mæsse
*Lammas Day (August 1) - (se) Hlǣfmæssan dæġ, (sēo) Hlǣfmæsse

==How to tell when something occurs==
*from...to/until... - fram (acc.) ōþ (acc) - ''fram ǣrne morgen ōþ ǣfen''
*in the morning - on morgen
*in the day - on dæġe
*in the dusk - on fōrannihte
*in the evening - on ǣfenne, æt ǣfenne, tō ǣfenne
*early in the morning - ǣr on morgen
*at dawn - on dægrǣd, on ūhtan, tō þǣm dægrǣd
*at noon - on midne dæg, tō middæge
*at dusk - on fōrannihte

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Subclassing'' can be useful when you want to add functionality that is not directly supported by Visual Basic.  To explain how this works we must first go through a little background theory. 

All ''windows'' in Windows (for example a form, a button, a listbox, etc.) have a function that the operating system or other programs can call to communicate with the program. Windows can, for example, send ''messages'' about ''events'' such as the mouse pointer moving over the window, a key being pressed when the window has the focus and much more. Programs can also send messages that ask for information about the window; for example, the ''EM_GETLINECOUNT'' message asks a textbox to send back the number of lines in the text it holds. One can also define one's own functions.

To call these special functions you can use ''PostMessage'', ''SendMessage'' or ''CallWindowProc'' (the last only if you know the address of the function). 

Usually such a procedure looks something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Function WindowProc(ByVal hwnd As Long, _
                             ByVal uMsg As Long, _
                             ByVal wParam As Long, _ 
                             ByVal lParam As Long) As Long
    	
    ' Your code here
    
    Select Case uMsg
      Case 0
        ' React to message 0 
      Case 1
        ' React to message 1
    End Select
    		
    WindowProc = 0 ' Return a value to the caller
    	
   End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

In this function ''hwnd'' is the ''handle'' of the ''window'' that the caller has tried to contact; ''uMsg'' is the ''message identifier'' which says what the call is about; ''wParam''  and ''lParam'' are used for whatever purpose the caller and window agree on. The handle, hwnd, is not an address but is used by Windows to find the address.

If, for example, we want to set the text that appears on the title bar of a form we can use the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib &quot;user32&quot; Alias &quot;SendMessageA&quot; _
          (ByVal hwnd As Long, _ 
           ByVal wMsg As Long, _
           ByVal wParam As Integer, _
           ByVal lParam As Any) As Long
    
    Private Const WM_SETTEXT = &amp;HC
    
  Private Sub Form_Load()  
    SendMessage Me.hwnd, WM_SETTEXT, 0&amp;, &quot;This is a test&quot;
  End Sub

The receiver will get this message via its window function, which will look something like this:

  Public Function WindowProc(ByVal hwnd As Long, _
                             ByVal uMsg As Long, _
                             ByVal wParam As Long, _ 
                             ByVal lParam As Long) As Long
    	
    ' hwnd is now equal to Me.hwnd, 
    ' uMsg is WM_SETTEXT, 
    ' wParam is 0 
    ' lParam is the address of the text: &quot;This is a test&quot;
         	
    ' It doesn't actually look like this of course, but this gives 
    ' a good enough impression of what happens under the surface
    Select Case uMsg
    	Case WM_SETTEXT	
        Me.Caption = lParam
      'Case ...
        '... many more here
    End Select    
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

==Why Subclass==
What is the point of ''subclassing''?

Using this technique we can completely replace a program's own window function with our own. Then we can respond to the messages in ways that Visual Basic doesn't, we can decide to send the messages further to the original window function or not as we like, modifying them on the way in any way we please.

==Example==
To specify that our window function is to be used we use the ''API'' call ''SetWindowLong''. Study the following example and put it in a base module:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Declare Function SetWindowLong Lib &quot;user32&quot; Alias &quot;SetWindowLongA&quot; _
          (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
           ByVal nIndex As Long, _  
           ByVal dwNewLong As Long) As Long
  
  Declare Function CallWindowProc Lib &quot;user32&quot; Alias &quot;CallWindowProcA&quot; _
          (ByVal lpPrevWndFunc As Long, _  
           ByVal hwnd As Long, _
           ByVal Msg As Long, _
           ByVal wParam As Long, _
           ByVal lParam As Long) As Long
    
  Declare Function SetClipboardViewer Lib &quot;user32&quot; _
          (ByVal hwnd As Long) As Long
    
  Declare Function SendMessage Lib &quot;user32&quot; Alias &quot;SendMessageA&quot; _
          (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
           ByVal wMsg As Long, _ 
           ByVal wParam As Integer, _
           ByVal lParam As Any) As Long
    
  Public Const WM_SETTEXT = &amp;HC
  Public Const GWL_WNDPROC = (-4)
    
  Private PrevProc As Long ' The address of the original window function
    
  Public Sub SubclassForm(F As Form)  
    ' AddressOf WindowProc = finds the address of a function
    PrevProc = SetWindowLong(F.hwnd, GWL_WNDPROC, AddressOf WindowProc)
  End Sub
    
  Public Sub UnSubclassForm(F As Form)    
    ' It is _very_ important that we restore the original window function,
    ' because VB will crash if we don't.
    SetWindowLong F.hwnd, GWL_WNDPROC, PrevProc
  End Sub
    
  Public Function WindowProc(ByVal hwnd As Long, _
                             ByVal uMsg As Long, _
                             ByVal wParam As Long, _ 
                             ByVal lParam As Long) As Long
        
    Dim sTemp As String
        
    If uMsg = WM_SETTEXT Then
      ' Don't let the text get through, replace it with our own. Also, because all
      ' strings in VB are of the format UTF-16 (Unicode) and the receiving method
      ' expects a zero-terminated ASCII-string, it is necessary to convert it before
      ' passing it further down the chain.
      sTemp = StrConv(&quot;Subclassing&quot; &amp; Chr(0), vbFromUnicode)
      lParam = StrPtr(sTemp) ' get the address of our text
    End If
        
    ' Call the original function
    WindowProc = CallWindowProc(PrevProc, hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam)
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

Add a form with a button ''cmdTest'' and add this code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Private Sub cmdTest_Click()
    SendMessage Me.hwnd, WM_SETTEXT, 0&amp;, &quot;This is a test&quot;
  End Sub
    
  Private Sub Form_Load()    
    ' Start subclassing
    SubclassForm Me    
  End Sub
    
  Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
    ' WARNING: If you stop the project (for example with the stop button) without calling this, 
    ' your program, as well as the VB IDE, will most likely crash.
    UnSubclassForm Me
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

When you click the ''cmdTest'' button, you'll see that the text that appears is not &quot;This is a test&quot;, but &quot;Subclassing&quot;.

== Overview ==

'''''Horcruxes''''' are any object in which a sorcerer may preserve a portion of his soul indefinitely. Anchoring a part of the soul to the earth by placing it in a Horcrux prevents the sorcerer's soul from going onwards should the sorcerer's body die; the effective result is that, given appropriate spells, the sorcerer can be brought back to life. This is considered to be among the darkest of all magic.

== Extended Description == 

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 23|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] learns how Horcruxes are created by experiencing a memory of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. In order to create a Horcrux, it is necessary that the wizard's soul be torn; the only known act that is powerful enough and damaging enough to do this is apparently for the wizard to commit murder. The torn soul fragment can then be removed and placed into another object; and so long as that object is not destroyed, the wizard can remain alive. 

Harry learns at the same time that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] had been intrigued by the possibility of the number seven, which would either mean that he intended to create seven Horcruxes, or that he intended to have seven soul shards, which would mean six Horcruxes. Dumbledore believes at the time, correctly as it turns out, that the intended number of Horcruxes is six. It is unknown at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' how successful Voldemort has been at creating Horcruxes, but we can assume that he did create six and secrete them in various objects. Two Horcruxes have been destroyed – Tom Riddle's diary that Harry destroyed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Marvolo Gaunt]]'s ring which was destroyed by Professor Dumbledore. A third was apparently eliminated by an erstwhile Death Eater identified only as R.A.B., but this turns out in the seventh book to not have happened. To defeat the Dark Lord, Harry must find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes and then kill Lord Voldemort.

Note that we do not list Horcruxes as having first appeared in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' because the diary is not identified as a Horcrux, by name or function, until ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''.

Harry and Dumbledore deduce that the remaining Horcruxes are quite possibly coveted heirlooms of the four Hogwarts House founders; they see how much Riddle covets the two that he has seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]]'s possession. One of these two, Salazar Slytherin's locket, was originally a Gaunt family heirloom; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Riddle's mother]] had sold it to Borgin and Burke for a pittance, to buy food, and they had sold it in turn to Hepzibah Smith. Riddle apparently stole it back from her and used it as a Horcrux. The other, Helga Hufflepuff's cup, has not been seen since Harry and Professor Dumbledore saw it in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 20|Hokey's memory]], but it evidently was also stolen by Riddle, and is presumed to have been made into a Horcrux.

== Analysis ==

At the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 6|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Hermione explains what she has learned about Horcruxes from the books she retrieved from Dumbledore's study. As mentioned above, the Horcrux cannot be destroyed to unbind the wizard from earth until the container housing it is destroyed. Souls are, by their nature, virtually indestructible; a fragment can be sheared away, as mentioned, by the act of committing murder, and that fragment, if contained in an object, causes the object to partake of its indestructibility. Ordinary magic cannot harm a Horcrux, any more than ordinary magic can harm a soul. It is mentioned that Harry destroyed the Diary Horcrux by stabbing it with a Basilisk fang; Basilisk venom is certainly extraordinary magic, given how uncommon basilisks are. Of the six Horcruxes destroyed, it turns out that five are destroyed by Basilisk venom in one form or another, and one by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Fiendfyre|Fiendfyre]].

One plot point left hanging at the end of ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' is a '''missing''' Horcrux. Dumbledore and Harry have clearly discovered where the Horcrux is hidden, but the Horcrux itself is gone, replaced with a substitute locket by one &quot;R.A.B.&quot; Both the substitute locket, and the unknown &quot;R. A. B.&quot; (presumed to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]]), are keys to the &quot;real&quot; locket's whereabouts.  In ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Black Family|Black family]] house is being used surreptitiously as headquarters for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters#Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Molly]] undertake to clean the house, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]], along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Mrs. Black's]] mad screaming portrait, undermines this effort. Listed among the objects being discarded is &quot;a heavy locket that none of them could open.&quot; Harry, having retreated to Grimmauld Place after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] has fallen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], sees Regulus' name on a bedroom door, and deduces that this must be the &quot;R.A.B.&quot; connected to the substitute locket. After fruitlessly searching Regulus' room, Hermione recalls the locket that they had earlier tried to discard. The locket had been hidden by Kreacher, then stolen by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], who was busily looting 12 Grimmauld Place during the early parts of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. Mundungus has, in turn, had it extorted away from him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]], resulting in Harry making an expedition into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] to retrieve it.

As noted above, Voldemort split his soul into seven parts.  In many cultures and religions, seven is a significant number, possibly because it is the &quot;most magical number&quot;, as Riddle says; hints of this magical power likely strayed into our Muggle world.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

For a list of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|the Dark Lord's]] Horcruxes, see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcruxes|Horcruxes]].

Obviously, Horcruxes are central to the story, and the location, and destruction, of these will be critical.

We believe, or rather Dumbledore does, that there were originally intended to be six Horcruxes, thus giving Voldemort seven soul pieces – one in his corporeal body, and six extras. While the uninitiate would suppose that one of these would have been used to reanimate him after his attempt to kill Harry resulted in the death of his body, this turns out not to be the case. Apparently, while the soul is physically split, such that part of it resides in an object external to the wizard, there is still a psychic linkage, and the wizard's soul cannot leave the Earth while the shard, locked in an object, remains. Thus, the main part of the soul remains present after the body dies, wandering unhoused through the world. It is this unhoused soul, taking control of various animals in Albania, that is all that remains of Voldemort until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]] runs into him, and for the two years between Quirrell's death and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Pettigrew]]'s return.

The first Horcrux, the diary, was actually the second one made, and was perhaps somewhat less valued by Tom Riddle. This may be why it was devised as a path to immortality and also as a weapon. The author has stated that this Horcrux was created by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle's]] death, killed by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]]. It is interesting that this Horcrux was aware of things that had happened after its creation; it could show Harry the discovery of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]], which happened the day after Myrtle's body was discovered.

We do not directly know whose death was associated with any of the other Horcruxes, and at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' we know for certain of only one other Horcrux, the Peverell [[w:Seal_(device)#Signet_rings|signet ring]]. We learn that the ring is a Horcrux during that book, when Dumbledore tells us that he has destroyed it. The remaining four are uncertain until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|the seventh book]], though Dumbledore's guesses about three of them do prove accurate. Until Harry retrieves and destroys them, we cannot be sure that Voldemort has placed Horcruxes in either Salazar Slytherin's locket or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Helga Hufflepuff|Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup, but by the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' we are aware that Voldemort wanted these items, presumably for that purpose; and the fact that the artifact retrieved at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' is a locket does indicate that Slytherin's locket likely is now a Horcrux, as the R.A.B. who removed the Horcrux is likely to have put something similar in its place.

Until the seventh book, we are unsure of the fifth Horcrux; we do not yet have any theory as to what it could be or how it was created. One fan site had suggested that the artifact in question is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]]'s wand, and that this is the &quot;one, solitary wand&quot; that rests in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander's]] shop window; this was suggested to have something to do with Mr. Ollivander disappearing in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. In that case, the murder that created the Horcrux could well have happened in Diagon Alley. This turns out to be incorrect; the fifth Horcrux is an artifact that we only learn about in the seventh book: Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.

We believe Voldemort intended to create the sixth and final Horcrux by killing Harry Potter. It is possible that he was carrying the artifact he meant to convert into a Horcrux with him, and it would have remained when he died. It could have been found in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]] when Harry goes to investigate there. Harry, however, never entered his parents' house, only looking at it from outside the overgrown hedge.

Thwarted by Harry, Voldemort apparently used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins']] death to create a final Horcrux, which Dumbledore believes lies within [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]]. There is a risk, of course, in that a living being, with a mind of its own, will interact to some extent with the associated soul fragment, but Voldemort would have been low on resources at this point, and only had a small selection of artifacts to choose from. In passing, we do see one of Dumbledore's very rare mistakes here; Dumbledore says that Voldemort used Nagini to kill Frank Bryce, and may have created a Horcrux at that time. This would imply that it is not necessary to kill someone directly in order to create a Horcrux; ordering another to do the killing would be sufficient, perhaps with the proviso that the being ordered to do the killing must not be sentient. However, reading the end of chapter 1 of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], we see that in fact Voldemort killed Frank Bryce with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|Killing curse]]. Thus, even if Bryce's death had resulted in creation of a Horcrux, we wouldn't know if directly murdering someone is necessary to the Horcrux creation spell. The author's saying that the Diary Horcrux was made by way of Moaning Myrtle's death, which was caused by the Basilisk, rather than directly by Riddle, does rather confirm that using an agent to commit the murder does not prevent a Horcrux being created.

==Discussion 1==

Hello all, 
Over the course of the next few months a set of groups will be posting new chapters to this book. To be able to do this effectively, I am going to propose deleting some of the chapters that are of lower quality, and reinserting the questions they were meant to answer into the &quot;Questions&quot; page. I will recommend some chapters to delete, and I would appreciate feedback. My criteria will include citations for the work presented, correctness of concepts, and general quality.

Thanks, [[User:Gerardo.ok|Gerardo.ok]] ([[User talk:Gerardo.ok|talk]]) 03:58, 18 March 2010 (UTC)

We are probably going to delete [[:wikisource:Wikisource:Source code|Wikisource:Source code]]. So I propose that some of these pages to be move here in Wikibooks. Please advise which pages would you like to get in Wikibooks. Thanks, [[User:Yann|Yann]] 18:49, 17 September 2005 (UTC)

== Floating Point Book ==

I am planning to create a book about floating point numbers. I have created a basic outline [[User:Whiteknight/Floating Point|HERE on my user page]]. I think that this would serve as good background information for people, considering that floating-point numbers are used all the time, but many people dont understand what they are, and what limitations they have. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions on this outline, before I turn it into an actual book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:21, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

* I think that it's good to have a nice run down of IEEE754, but I don't think it warrants a whole book, most languages use IEEE754. Maybe a short book on representation of data? With characters, (ASCII, UTF, etc.), Integers (positive and negative), Floats and possibly touching on error detection/correction? [[User:Tinned Tuna|Tinned Tuna]] ([[User talk:Tinned Tuna|talk]])

==Software Engineering is NOT Computer Science==
Folks, SCIENCE is the discovery of new facts.  Engineering is the application of Science in an effective way to solve a problem.  Therefore Software Engineering does not really belong here in Computer Science.  Yes, that's the popular way it has been.  However, as Canada and Texas have demonstrated, there is a difference and that difference is going to matter more and more.  That's why they both license Software Engineers as Licensed Professional Engineers and to obtain one of those designations you'll have to have much more massive experience with a Computer Science Degree than you would need if you had an Engineering Degree.


* In fact, software engineering ''is'' a part of computer science. There are people at university who do research in that area: They analyze what can go wrong and try to improve the process of developping software. For example, they try to find optimal ways to organize a team of programmers, or they try to predict in which part of a program bugs are usually created. Software engineering is, however, ''not'' about the actual programming techniques. [[User:Ylloh|Ylloh]] 23:15, 2 November 2007 (UTC)

== Topics and Order ==

I think that some work should be spent on reordering the books in the bookshelf and using useful and ''accessible'' headings. [[User:Ylloh|Ylloh]] 23:20, 2 November 2007 (UTC)

== Remove protected status ==

Please remove protected status from this page.

:I have now unprotected this page.  It was originally protected in early 2006 but I don't know why. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:36, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

::Thank you.  The other bookshelves seem to be protected too, so it would be helpful to remove protected status from those pages too.

== Remove .Net Framework from networking section ==

The .Net Framework has absolutely nothing to do with networking.</text>

==Vowels==
===Short Vowels===
* a - vowel sound between ''c&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;t'' and ''&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;ll''.  NEVER ''f&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;te''.   
* i - vowel sound between ''b&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;t'' and ''mach&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;ne''.  NEVER ''l&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;ke'' or ''b&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;te''.
* u - vowel sound between ''p&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;t'' and ''gl&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;e''.  NEVER ''ref&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;se''.
===Long Vowels===
These are pronounced twice as long as their corresponding short vowels. The short vowels are to the left of the arrow.
* a → aa
* i → ii ''' or''' ee 
* u → uu '''or''' oo

==Diphthongs==

* au/aw - as in ''bl&lt;b&gt;ou&lt;/b&gt;se''
* ai - as in ''b&lt;b&gt;ai&lt;/b&gt;t''

==non-phonetic Indicators==
*aà- alif maksuura
*ä-taa' marbuuTäh
*N-tanwiin/nunation
*aá-non-spelt alif
*uù - waaw and then a silent alif

&lt;br&gt;tanwiin pronounced as &quot;aa&quot; in pausal form:
&lt;br&gt;kitaabâN


Whenever vocab is introduced: 
It should be introduced with taa' marbuuTäh represented thus:  ä. 
&lt;br&gt;When it is in a sentence where it is pronounced with a &quot;t&quot; sound: ät
&lt;br&gt;dhahaba ilaà al-jaami`äh[i].
&lt;br&gt;dhahaba ilaà al-jaami`äti wa jalas[a].

*Whenever &quot;h&quot; occurs directly after a constanant and is not part of a diagraph it must be italicized. This takes away the problem of italicizing every digraph which was experienced in writing this book (which was tedious).

*Unpronounced parts should be enclosed in square brackets, that is: [like this]

==The more difficult sounds==

kh-the German &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;bach&quot; or the Scottish &quot;loch.&quot;.  sounds like k in English except with gargling happening.&lt;br&gt;
gh- voiced version of the above. This is the gargled Parisian &quot;r&quot; sound.
&lt;br&gt;
` - Most English people don't hear this sound at all. If you don't know how to pronounce &quot;`ain&quot; just ignore the `ain sound and pronounce it as if it weren't there.&lt;br&gt;
' - This apostrophe is used to represent &quot;hamza&quot;, the least important of Arabic sounds. The sound it makes is known as a glottal stop. What is important is that you know it is a vowel separator. When it's not a vowel separator English people don't hear it.
Transliteration: su'aal  
&lt;br&gt;
Syllable by syllable: su-aal
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Special Arabic constanants:
H, S, D, T, Dh
To beginners these sound like the lowercase counterparts in the transliteration. Note they are different letters in Arabic and change meaning. For example &quot;ba`d&quot; (after) vs. ba`'''d''' (some). These will take time to pronounce properly, in the meantime pronouncing them as if they were the non-capital versions is good.

*'''h'''- Special Arabic h.
Pronounced with more force. Try whispering &quot;hello&quot; as loud as you can, and you get the sense of this consonant.
*'''s'''- emphatic of s (also can be pronounced as the emphatic of z)
*'''d'''- emphatic of &quot;d&quot;.
*'''t'''- emphatic of &quot;t&quot;.
*'''đ'''-


q- sometimes sounds like a k or a g.  Instructions: try to pronounce a &quot;k&quot; or the &quot;g&quot; in &quot;god&quot; while preventing your tongue from going up at its usual place. Relax your tongue. Open the back of your throat by dropping your chin down. The sound comes from as far back in the throat as you can make it.

== Foreword ==
This book covers the C++ programming language, its interactions with software design and real life use of the language. It is presented as an introductory to advance course but can be used as reference book.

If you are familiar with programming in other languages you may just skim the '''[[C++ Programming/Chapters/C++|Getting Started Chapter]]'''. You should not skip the '''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms|Programming Paradigms Section]]''', because C++ does have some particulars that should be useful even if you already know another Object Oriented Programming language. 

The '''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Comparisons|Language Comparisons Section]]''' provides comparisons for some language(s) you may already know, which may be useful for veteran programmers. 

If this is your first contact with programming then read the book from the beginning. Bear in mind that the ''Programming Paradigms'' section can be hard to digest if you lack some experience. Do not despair, the relevant points will be extended as other concepts are introduced. That section is provided so to give you a mental framework, not only to understand C++, but to let you easily adapt to (and from) other languages that may share concepts.

==Guide to readers==
This book is a [[w:wikibook|Wikibook]] [[Main Page|(en.wikibooks.org)]], an up-to-date copy of the work is hosted there.

It is organized into different parts, but as this is a work that is always evolving, things may be missing or just not where they should be, you are free to become a writer and contribute to fix things up...

Many students have constant problems with different courses, despite the effort put in. This short guide will show some basic steps on how to pass a course.  

This is not meant to be a full treatise on study methods, but rather a practical guide of various techniques. 

The effectiveness of various study techniques varies from person to person. This wikibook is concentrating mostly on the techniques that commonly work well. Some people who will find that a personal technique, sometimes unconventional, works better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{How to Pass a Course}}

Attending class is essential to pass a course.  If possible, you should go to every single class.  Sit as close to the front as possible, and most importantly, pay attention.  This might seem obvious, but many people go to class and don't really pay attention because they are busy doing something else: taking notes.  

== Limiting notes to better understand concepts ==
To get the most out of class, you need to try to form an understanding of what the lecturer is attempting to teach. It is worthwhile jotting down the key ideas that are being presented in each lecture, to jog your memory later.  Trying to write down verbatim what the lecturer says, however, will stop you from actually understanding what they mean.  In addition, course material is usually provided (and often this includes lecture transcripts), either from your lecturer, their department, or in a textbook or the Internet.  Many students write a large amount of notes during classes, but have to go back and read the notes to understand what the material is about.  It's not uncommon to have a student write some information more than once, since they are not processing what they are writing.  If you've just written down the key ideas, however, you can still pay attention to the lecturer, and can quickly plan for exams and other assessments without needing to re-digest it at a later date.  Try to limit yourself, normally one page of notes per three hour lecture should be enough. Find the level that is right for you- listening and thinking critically may mean writing down questions or ideas that come to mind. 

Forming an understanding of the ideas behind each lecture requires active thinking.  Try to think ahead of the professor: &quot;What is he going to say next?&quot;.  If the professor asks someone else a question, answer it in your head.  If you answer wrong, try to think why it was wrong.

Your approach to getting the most out of each class should be catered to the style of the lecture (or discussion). While some lecturers will help their students avoid feverishly writing down every fact and number covered by handing out lecture guides, others will not. It is crucial that you determine whether it is better to get all the notes written down, or to pick your head up and pay more attention to the larger picture. To best make this decision (and to do so early on), think about the type of evaluation the teacher is going to be giving. Classes with multiple choice exams typically require more note-taking, or the assistance of a lecture pamphlet handed out by the professor. On the other hand, classes where the student is graded on papers or written answer questions require more of a macro-idea approach (i.e. don't scribble, think). Above all, participation is key. The more questions you ask, the more you will learn. Speaking during class will keep you awake and involved, especially if you are asking the professor in front of a lot of people.

== Taking notes constantly from a tirade of new vocabulary ==
Cruel exceptions are present to these suggestions. There are always lecturers that quickly dictate long, complex processes and terms that are not in the course book. Many professors want to be concept based, but are so far into the ivory tower that they can't think outside of lists and definitions of terms. If this is the case, write down terms in ways that help you remember them, paraphrasing and rephrasing. If you can't paraphrase something, you don't understand it. In that situation, raise your hand and ask for clarification. In a class size under 30, this is class participation, and necessary. In a class size of 100-500, the professor does not know your name, and cannot associate your face with it, so you can politely interrupt all the time. This will encourage others to do so, giving everyone a chance to write things down.

== Seating suggestions for college ==
In high school, for the most part, the good kids sat in the front, the bad kids in the back. In college, the story changes slightly. After the first midterm in a difficult course, or just a course with a lot of freshmen, the front is a bad place to sit. People who did very poorly on the test got up this morning and said to themselves, 'today, I'm going to sit at the front of the class'. They find an influx of students coming much earlier than usual, and all sitting right up front. Unfortunately, their conviction to sit up front doesn't always go as far as being quiet into the lecture; after all, they're surrounded by their friends. There is no reason to put up with this just to maintain some kind of good student stereotype. Moreover, there are more important considerations. College classrooms can be just as inadequate as high school ones, just possibly much larger. So you think about where to sit in terms of ability to hear the professor, ability to see the displays, distance from people you don't like, ability to not strain your neck, and ability to get out of the classroom comfortably. Don't let the need to get out scare you to the back of the class, most large classrooms have an exit in the front.</text>

Sometimes the amount of assignments is overwhelming, however, it's vital to turn in every single assignment.  Any credit that can be accumulated, even if it's partial credit, can be helpful at the end.  Learn to use the 80-20 rule: 20 percent of your effort will give you 80 percent of the credit.  For example, if an assignment would take you 10 hours for an A worthy paper, 2 hours will most likely yield a B worthy paper.  Make sure you go for that B, and if time permits, polish it to make it an A.  However, an assignment that's not turned in will give you no credit at all.  It is also important to turn the assignments in on time in order to avoid losing credit for simply turning in something late.

==The Outline==
Fire up your favorite word processor and start with the outline.  Write down every single heading that you will need.  Basically each heading should correspond to each point that the paper should have.  Your professor might have given you a list of points that the paper must contain, if that's the case, then that should be your outline.  Take each point, in order, and turn it into a heading.  Make sure to use the &quot;Style&quot; feature to format the headings as &quot;Heading 1&quot;, &quot;Heading 2&quot;, and &quot;Heading 3&quot; as appropriate.  Also, if possible, use the &quot;Outline View&quot; mode available in most modern word processors.  This can help you visualize the whole paper in a single screen.  This can normally be done in half an hour.

==Creating the content==
Once you have the outline, start filling each heading with the corresponding information.  If you need information sources, try to find them before and have them on hand.  Set yourself a time frame to have a very rough draft.  Normally two to four hours should be enough from start to finish.

Under each heading you should have an introductory paragraph, introducing  the issue that is going to be developed.  This paragraph should be quite general.  Each subsequent paragraph in the section must deal with a single idea.  State this idea in the first one or two sentences, then provide details, an example, or a quote.  Follow each quote with a &lt;b&gt;simple&lt;/b&gt; opinion. 

Things to have in mind:
* Stay on topic, and try to fill the requirements of the paper.  That's the objective, nothing more, nothing less. 
* Be objective, avoid controversial opinions unless you have very strong arguments to support your opinion.
* Write your statements with confidence.  Attitude is half of the game.

==Wrapping up the paper==
After you have finished your paper, go back to the top.  Some readers might have noticed that one of the most important parts of a paper was neglected: the thesis statement.  Normally this is written first.  However, that's under the assumption that you have a clear idea of what you are writing, and where you want to get to.  This assumption is not valid in the context of the book.  Rather, the focus is that you don't have a clear idea about what you are writing.  However, while writing the paper you will get to know what you are writing about.  By the end you should know where you got to: that should be your thesis statement.  Of course, make sure it looks like it was made before writing the paper.

==Final details==
Make sure that you include a few details to make your paper look more polished:
* A table of contents: Remember that it was suggested to use the &quot;Heading&quot; styles available in your word processor? They will come in handy to create a nice looking table of contents in less than a minute.  Every modern word processor will make it for you.
* Page numbers: You have table of contents, add the page numbers to go along.  Again, use you word processor feature to make the page number.
* Sources cited: There's a very thin line between research and plagiarism. And this line can be described as citing your sources. Make sure you do it, even if it seems obvious.
* Cover page: Make a nice yet simple cover page, and save it as template to be reused in all of your assignments. Make sure it has all of the important information:
**Course name
**Assignment name
**Date
**Your name
**An ID number should it be required
**Name of the professor
**Name of the institution</text>

The addition of cheese changes the texture of the crust. I personally like it better without cheese. Another trick for better crust is never touch the dough with your palm. Only use the tip of the finger to keep the dough cool. Oh, the traditional garnish is not raisin, but clove.</text>

&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;&quot;If consciousness is in fact defined (and different) at every moment of time, it should also be related to points in space: the truly subjective observer system should be related to space-time points.&quot; from &quot;Quantum Theory and Time Asymmetry&quot;, Zeh (1979).&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

It has been shown that conscious experience is a view of the output of the brain, it has no apparent function, it is seen from a point that is, itself, empty and it operates no processes. This bizarre description of consciousness should have been expected because if consciousness were simple it would have been explained centuries ago. In this chapter the description will be phrased in simple mathematical language and related to the inferred physical world so that it can be understood in terms of the neurophysiology of the brain. 

The theory will describe experience as a virtual reality within the brain that spans both time and space. This virtual reality exists in the form of a set of vectors directed at an observation point which create a geometric form that we know as a 'view'. It will be proposed that our brains, like the rest of the universe (see Chapter 3), are arranged in at least 4 dimensions and it is the peculiar geometry of this four dimensional space-time that is responsible for the 'view'. It will be shown that nothing need move into the observation point within this 'view'.  It will be proposed that most of the brain is dedicated to populating this small, conscious, volume of brain activity with a model of the world and self. 

&lt;B&gt;Part 1: Explaining the View&lt;/B&gt;

The first step in developing a hypothesis that incorporates consciousness is to describe the geometry of the 'view' described in chapter 1. The 'view' that is our experience consists of things arranged vertically and horizontally with an uncertain separation of things from the observation point. The observation point is a geometrical phenomenon that contains nothing and the things in the view occur simultaneously. The things in the view must be things in themselves, there cannot be a need for any other observer or further observation, this implies that a 4D coordinate system is required to describe them (see Chapter 3). The things in the view cannot have any separation from the point but also cannot be at the point in 3D. These constraints of simultaneity, four coordinate axes and zero separation from a point suggest that the position of any object in the view relative to the observation point might be described, using Pythagoras' theorem for intervals, as:

&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(1) 0 = x&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - b&lt;SUP&gt;2
&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

The equation describes a succession of three dimensional spherical surfaces that are separated from the observation point (origin) along the x,y,z and b axes but any point on the inside of any of these spheres is no distance at all from the origin. Things are 'out there' in the x,y,z directions but also no distance from the origin when the b direction is taken into account. The separation between things in the view depends upon the angular separation of the things at the observation point. There is both nothing and the whole view at the observation point in the same way as we observe the view at a point but can find nothing inside this point.  This description is not a 'theory', it is simply a description of an aspect of conscious experience that uses mathematics.

[[Image: theories32.gif]]

Is it possible to go a step further and use the constraint of simultaneity to identify 'b' with a length of physical time, 'ct'? So that:

&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;0 = x&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - ct&lt;SUP&gt;2
&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

This equation describes both binding and simultaneity. It has an identical form to the Minkowski Light Cone Equation (see Physics for Consciousness Studies) and either the equation is describing some non-physical space or it's use in this context is a reinterpretation of Relativity Theory (specifically, time might have imaginary coordinates, see below). This equation is a theory because there is no way to determine that b=ct, the identity is assumed from the similarity of the two equations and their field of application.
If equation (1) were correct the 'view' would be a small volume or shell of brain activity, probably in the thalamus. The 'view' would be sensitive to mechanical distortion because x,y,z refer to actual positions within a volume of brain. The equation can be tested by cyclically deforming potential sites in the thalamus and observing the response of subjects. Bilateral deformation would be required and the expected response, if the deformation were severe, would probably be one of the following: absence seizure, akinetic mutism or delirium (see Note 1). 

It has already been shown that bilateral electrical stimulation of the centromedian nuclei of the thalamus causes absence seizures (Velasco ''et al.'' (2000). It might also be expected that Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation could also be used to block ILN activity and so cause absence seizures. Administration of general anaesthetic by micropipette could be used to selectively deactivate areas of any nuclei that mediate consciousness and allow topographical analysis.

This hypothesis about the 'view' does not explain consciousness but it seems to account for the geometry of experience (perception, dreams, bodily sensation etc.).

&lt;B&gt;Part 2: A Description of the Extended Present&lt;/B&gt;

The second step required for a theory of consciousness is to describe the &quot;specious&quot; or extended present.

The experience of a stable world involves not just a view but a view extended in time. This extension in time is not a trivial set of instantaneous, frozen models of the world but is a continuous set of events. We hear whole words and experience movements; we are not confined to an impossible instant. The important features of this time extension are that things are experienced extended in time at their location in mental space and that they are observed at a point. This was discussed in full in the section on &quot;Time&quot; in chapter 1. The empirical equation (1) can be extended by adding a displacement in another coordinate axis:

&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(2) 0 = x&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; - &amp;#916;b&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; + &amp;#916;e&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

Where &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#916;&lt;/FONT&gt;e is a small displacement of an object in mental time; small displacements have been specified because the extended present is fairly short and may not be linearly related to the other variables. This equation applies to particular objects, once a sequence of events involving a given object has ended the events are no longer available i.e.: when a word is finished it is no longer in the extended present. This description is not a 'theory'. For a given spherical shell (&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;x&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;) is the radius, r, of the sphere relative to the observation point so:

&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;0 = r&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; - &amp;#916;b&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; + &amp;#916;e&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2

&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;If r is small compared with &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#916;&lt;/FONT&gt;b and &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#916;&lt;/FONT&gt;e and constant:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#916;b&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; &amp;#8776; &amp;#916;e&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2

&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;These are empirical equations describing experience but they can be tentatively extended to describe physical space and time. If 'b' is substituted by physical time:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt;(c&amp;#916;t)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; = &amp;#916;e&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2

&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;So &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#916;t = &amp;#916;e/c

&lt;/FONT&gt;And &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#916;T = &amp;#916;t

&lt;/FONT&gt;Where T is mental time in seconds rather than metres and t is physical time in seconds. Our experience of time would be due to displacements in mental time, not physical time. In contrast, the physical time axis would be responsible for creating the geometric form of the view where things seem to be observed at a point because it has an opposite sign to the other axes. Equation (2) is a highly simplified description of the geometric form of the view; even a brief consideration of the possible configurations of a five dimensional space-time leads to endless possibilities such as Lorentz Transformations of axes and the disappearance of separation along the path taken by the observation point. Again, the identification of 'b' with 'ct' means that this is a theory.

The arrangements of objects in time seem 'timelike' because they are independent arrangements of things at a given place that do not obscure each other, a thing arranged in space in the immediate past does not overlie its arrangement in space now. Furthermore the observation point seems to be moving perpetually along the time axis so that the extended present attached to a past event is always lost to observation at the end of the event, or event sequence. This time extended configuration of data might provide the stability required for a reference model of the world and mind, or Reference State, in a small set of neurons.

[[Image: theories35.gif]]

This idea of experience as a form rather than a process is well known (cf: Bateson's (1979) &quot;zigzag ladder of dialectic between form and process&quot;) and it is usually argued that experience can be neither a form nor a process. However, if experience is a form that includes the succession of events then it is a form that includes processes. At any instant there is a structured set of events stretching into the past and spread out in space that are part of the geometric form. The events are separated by angles through both space and time at the observation point. The future has not yet been selected so there are no defined events leading into the future. This provides an experience of moving forward into the future at any instant. 

An important feature of this theory is that &lt;B&gt;experience is not the observation point at an instant&lt;/B&gt;. Experience is both the successions of events extended in time and the observation point. In the equation 

&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;0 = x&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; - &amp;#916;b&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; + &amp;#916;e&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

experience is all those events that have coordinates (x,y,z,b,e), not those events that have coordinates (0,0,0,0,0). This means that experience is a set of events laid out in a framework that has remarkable properties. It has a 'negative' dimension (b) that allows places where separations in both time and space are zero. The framework has a geometrical duality where the same events are at a point at an instant and 'out there', spread out in the time and space of the brain.

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;B&gt;Part 3: Control of Brain Activity by a Geometrical Form

&lt;/B&gt;If this description is correct the past state of a system at a point exists and might provide a preferred basis for the present instant. This is not too dissimilar to Zeh's (1979) suggestion that the conscious observer is a configuration of quantum states at a point (see Note 2). The problem confronting the theorist is how to connect the empirical equation for the positions of the objects in experience:

&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;0 = x&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + y&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + z&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; - &amp;#916;b&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; + &amp;#916;e&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

With Zeh's equation for the superposition at a point observer:

&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt;|&amp;#946;&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt; =&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#8747; &lt;/B&gt;d(&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;1&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;))... d(&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;)) f({&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;)}) |{&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;)}&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

and how to integrate a five dimensional geometry into the physical universe. It should be stressed that equation (2) is an &lt;B&gt;empirical&lt;/B&gt; equation. It is the task of mathematicians and theoretical physicists to discover how such an equation could be compatible with modern science or to suggest an equation that is more appropriate.

The Reference State would provide an alternative preferred basis to that supplied by the aqueous medium of the brain. If the Reference State selected configurations of brain activity that generated actions it would change the world in general via these actions in the normal way. In quantum mechanical terms, the state vector of the world in general would be most influenced by the ambient environment but would contain contributions from the preferred basis of each conscious observer. It should be stressed that this idea is purely theoretical.

The existence of a Reference State in the brain could be investigated by examining brain activity in comatose subjects. If the brain activity in comatose subjects shows patterns that can be ascribed to quantum fluctuations in individual neurons or small groups of neurons but does not show these in conscious subjects the hypothesis would be supported. Bershadskii ''et al.'' (2003) may have recently observed such an effect in the &quot;genetically depressive limbic brain&quot; of the Flinders Sensitive Line of rats. 

&lt;B&gt;A New Empiricism: Geometrical Phenomenalism

&lt;/B&gt;The theory that conscious experience is a phenomenon, a geometric form that allows knowledge of a phenomenal world, will be called 'geometrical phenomenalism'. Geometrical Phenomenalism maintains that consciousness is a complex phenomenon that consists of a geometric form of the output of neural processing. It is largely an empirical theory.

The empirical part of the theory is fairly straightforward, it proposes that the paradox of consciousness is due to a mind that is brain activity spread out in space and time but also not separated from a point that is at the present instant. This is how the mind seems as our physical body looks around the world: our experience is brain activity but it seems to be viewed from a point eye within this activity. The theory explicitly describes as 'non-conscious' all activity that is not in the space and time of the mind. It differs from information systems theories because it describes conscious experience, not the non-conscious processes that load things into this experience. 

Part 3 of the theory is not empirical. As such it is most open to criticism. Each part of the theory is independent of the other parts so Part 1 may be true even if Part 2 or Part3 are found to be false.

&lt;B&gt;The Interpretation of Relativity and Quantum Theory

&lt;/B&gt;Geometrical Phenomenalism introduces a negative dimension (Weyl, 1918) which may correspond to physical time. Historians of Relativity Theory will immediately recognise this as the 'imaginary time' used in early, simplistic models of the theory (see chapter 2) and modern Relativity Theorists will, quite rightly, chuckle at such an archaic concept. There can be little doubt that 'real time' is needed to describe the motion of matter and energy. Energy flows into an observation point along one path in space-time and flows out from it along another, different path. These two paths are not distinguished by 'imaginary time' but are clearly different in real time. However, there is a major difference between our conscious experience and this conventional description of the universe: nothing flows into the observation point in conscious experience.

Is it possible that space and time have one geometry that applies to observation points in conscious experience and another geometry that applies to actual movements of energy from place to place? The answer to this is not only 'yes' but there is ample evidence that this occurs. Quantum physicists have long persisted in using the archaic form of Relativity in a disguise known as the Wick Rotation in Feynman Path Integrals. They use this embarrassing formalism because it works; it describes how all the possible positions of a particle that never actually occur affect the position of the particle that is observed. The problem confronting quantum physicists is quite similar to the problem confronting the empirical science of consciousness: what is the geometry of space-time where nothing actually moves?

Cosmologists have also incorporated imaginary time into descriptions of the universe as a whole and the current, empirical description of the geometry of the universe might be summarised as:

&quot;.. we see that, today, the qualitative behavior of our universe is that of a de Sitter universe except that the presence of matter has caused the universe to expand less than in the de Sitter case.&quot; Reid ''et al.'' (2002). A &quot;de Sitter&quot; universe is described by the metric: ds&lt;SUP&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; = dx&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + dy&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + dz&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; - dt&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt; + de&lt;SUP&gt;2&lt;/SUP&gt;&amp;nbsp;where t is conventionally imaginary (i.e.: square root of minus one multiplied by t). This is very similar to equation (2) above.

The use of 'imaginary time' may not be the only way to explain conscious observation. It is possible that real time might apply, perhaps by some 'virtual movement of photons back and forwards towards the centre of a volume of neural tissue.

&lt;B&gt;The Physical Nature of the Site of Conscious Experience&lt;/B&gt;

Any site for conscious experience would be a small, nearly spherical, shell or volume of neurons that is highly interconnected with the cortex and the rest of the brain. It would be physically and functionally close to sensory input paths to obtain reference data from the senses. It would be large enough to represent all the content of experience. The optic nerve contains about a million fibres so a total of about one million data points might be needed. Data could be held at the level of individual synapses. There might be over 100000 synapses per mm&lt;SUP&gt;3&lt;/SUP&gt; (over 1000 per neuron) in a nucleus which means that a nucleus of 2 mm&lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt;in radius (about 3 million synapses) might support a sufficient density of data points to be a consciousness centre. 

It is probable that there would be at least four such centres with two archaic centres below the cerebellum and two below the cerebrum. Only one would be dominant. The requirement that only one nucleus is dominant means that it would need to be well connected to both hemispheres of the cerebrum.

The best candidate for such a centre for conscious experience is one of the centromedian nuclei of the thalamus although this is not the only possibility.

&lt;B&gt;Qualia&lt;/B&gt;

Objects in experience consist of qualia such as colours, sounds etc. The field of qualia that is experience could be any field of neural activity in the ILN although it could be limited, for example, to an electromagnetic field (McFadden 2002) or a 'spin' field (Hu 2002).

&lt;B&gt;The Problem of Knowledge&lt;/B&gt;

Imagine something for no time at all. It cannot be done. Say a word like 'at'. Could you know the 'a' if it lasted for no time? Knowing involves two factors, classification and continuity. It was pointed out in chapter 1 that knowledge of sorts remains even when there is nothing to classify, such as when meditating so that there is only dark or light. There seems to be no difference between the experience called 'knowledge' and the experience called 'continuity' in these circumstances. Continuity is experiencing your experience of experiencing without the need for recursion (i.e.: without the need for cycling things around from one moment to the next).

An experience of an experience suggests that each instant of observation is available to succeeding instants. This is quite possible if five coordinate axes are permitted along with zero length vectors because things can be arranged in an enormous number of different ways. This flexibility makes it possible for an extended experience in the past to be a subset of present extended experience.

Having read this section many readers may be thinking 'Ah, but how do I know what things mean? If I see a tree why do I know its a tree?'. The answer to this is that your non-conscious brain has most of the details of 'tree' classified and logged. You do not know these details consciously, you just know that such details exist, a state called 'familiarity'. The continuity of the sensation of familiarity attached to the tree and the body ('gut feeling') is 'knowing you know' the tree.

&lt;B&gt;Depth Perception&lt;/B&gt;

Geometrical Phenomenalism does not include any direct experience of depth. The separation of the observation point from the things in experience is indeterminate which is why we see the stars on the ceiling of a planetarium or on the screens of virtual reality goggles as incredibly distant from us. Although depth is indeterminate we still feel as if our chests are below our heads and our feet are below our chests, how is this done?

If you shut your eyes and swing an arm the path of the hand is experienced in a shadowy way. This shadowy progress of the hand does not have a common English term to describe it but we can all experience it. (Technically it might be called kinaesthesia or motion somaesthesis). If uniform swings are used it can seem as if the moving hand has two components, the actual moving hand and copy that follows it a split second later. If the hand is moved from the head to the knee the path of the hand occurs as a shadowy arc stretching through the extended present. This raises the possibility that our experience of depth within and around our bodies is actually an experience of time. For instance, when we experience our feet being below our chest we are actually experiencing an imaginary movement of the hand or a movement of the focussing muscles in the eyes or a succession of sensations first from the chest then from the feet etc. The space occupied by the body then becomes an 'action space' with separations defined by the timing of movements and sensations.

Binocular depth perception is different from the sense of bodily extension. When we look at the medium and far distance through either one or both eyes the view is almost identical. If we focus on objects that are close to us the more distant object become blurred; the act of focussing separates the world into a shell of things that are in focus and other things that are blurred. If we focus past a nearby object the nearby object splits into two images, one blurred and solid and the other blurred and transparent. All of these effects combined with the change in the relative size of objects with distance provide cues for judging distance. At no time do we have a clear view of things arranged in depth in the same way as we have a clear view of things arranged vertically and horizontally. We do, however have a sense of where we could reach out and touch things, which suggests that imaginary motion somaesthesis may create an experience of depth. If the non-conscious brain is providing models of motion to augment the experience of depth then this may be one of many possible explanations for how the accuracy of depth judgement decreases with distance (see for instance Cutting &amp;amp; Vishton 1995).

&lt;B&gt;Philosophical Implications of the Theory and Free Will
&lt;/B&gt;

The most important philosophical implication is that time exists. The mind should be considered as a trans-temporal entity occupying a length of time with an extended present that is accessible now. Another feature of the model is that the brain itself might, occasionally, become the source of a branch-point in the quantum multiverse. The theory is also compatible with philosophical systems that deny the physical world and science because it considers science to be a consistent system of things that are compatible with observation. The physical world can be accepted or rejected without invalidating the theory. It is, of course, also compatible with ordinary natural philosophy.

The theory may also have implications for the philosophical problem of &quot;free will&quot;. A vast amount has been written about &quot;free will&quot; and the current state of the arguments is summarised in Timothy O'Connor's entry in the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.seop.leeds.ac.uk/entries/freewill/&quot;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/A&gt;. The aspect of &quot;free will&quot; that is of most interest when discussing consciousness is whether there can be &quot;conscious free will&quot;.&amp;nbsp;We are certainly conscious of the decisions made by the non-conscious brain but are there any types of decision that are due to consciousness itself?

If the theory of consciousness proposed above is correct our 'reference state of mind' will have a marked effect on decision taking. This state will select processes that are consistent with it from a myriad of possible processes. The 'reference state of mind' itself will depend on the history of the individual's previous selections and exposure to the world at large. It will also depend upon the type of state of mind that the individual is seeking. It is unique to the individual (cf: the &quot;no cloning&quot; objection of quantum physics) and consists of a combination of all the things in conscious experience from emotions through pains in the back to attitudes. In the sense that our 'reference state of mind' may be unique, impossible to measure and equally difficult to predict it may be said to be a basis for &quot;free will&quot;. But can we navigate to a new 'reference state of mind', can we choose the basis of our choices?

&lt;B&gt;The Self&lt;/B&gt;

The space and time of the mind contains sense data from the world, sense data from the body and output from neural processes such as those that generate imaginary speech, daydreams, dreams etc.. 'I' am the body nearest to the observation point and this has a speech processor that calls this body and itself 'me'. My body has an array of sensory processes, especially splanchnic sensations, motor controls, and modelling activities, including imaginary speech that are not found in the part of the mind that is not correlated with the body. This collection in the mind of body, thoughts, feelings and actions I call my 'self'. Most parts of 'self', such as the body, skills etc. are not themselves conscious. Only the mind is conscious and this contains things correlated with both the world and the 'self'. 

&lt;B&gt;Notes

Note 1&lt;/B&gt;: Schiff and Plum (2003) categorise the following states that can occur after destruction of the Intra Laminar nuclei as aroused but not aware or possibly not aware: persistent vegetative states, absence seizures, akinetic mutism, and severe delirium. In the absence of consciousness there is a profound lack of purposeful activity. 

&lt;B&gt;Note 2&lt;/B&gt;: Zeh's derivation of the quantum point observer.

Zeh postulates that the universe contains an observer that is a local system that can be specified as an orthonormal basis of states &lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot;&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;, the rest of the universe is a basis of states &lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&amp;#968;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;k&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;, the global state of the universe is given by: &lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot;&gt;&amp;#931;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;ik&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; &lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot;&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;i&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&amp;#968;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;k&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;. If a result, &lt;I&gt;l&lt;/I&gt; is observed the new state would be a product state:&amp;nbsp;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot;&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;l&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&amp;#968;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;l&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt; where &lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot;&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; and &lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&amp;#968;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; in this case refer only to the ensemble of probabilities of the new state. If space-time at a given moment, t, is divided into two regions, I&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; being the observer and I&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; the rest then any state vector |&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot;&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;(x)&amp;gt; is given by the direct product |&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot;&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;(x)&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&amp;gt;|&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot;&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;(x)&lt;SUB&gt; 2&lt;/SUB&gt;&amp;gt;. It is possible to use this to derive the state vector of a given state (&lt;I&gt;l&lt;/I&gt;) in terms of the space-time of the observer:

|&amp;#946;&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt; = &lt;B&gt;&amp;#8747;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;1&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;B&gt; &lt;/B&gt;D &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt; &amp;#968;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;l&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;[&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x), t]|&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x)&amp;gt;&lt;SUB&gt; 1
&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;

This specifies a set of product states that can be distinguished by the index, &lt;I&gt;l&lt;/I&gt;. The integration only occurs over the space-time region of the observer and consciousness could branch into any of the product states. This means that at each point there is a different state. What is the state at a single point? This is derived from the previous equation with &lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;x&lt;/FONT&gt; set to &lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;x&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;:

&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Times New Roman&quot; SIZE=4&gt;|&amp;#946;&amp;gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt; =&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#8747; &lt;/B&gt;d(&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;1&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;))... d(&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;)) f({&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;)}) |{&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Lucida Console&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#1092;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;SUB&gt;&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Courier New&quot; SIZE=4&gt;&amp;#957;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/SUB&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=4&gt;(x&lt;SUB&gt;0&lt;/SUB&gt;)}&amp;gt;
&lt;/FONT&gt;

So each point has a superposition of vectors.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; : &lt;small&gt;In C and C++ the behavior is defined and sometimes intentionally used however in this comparison we consider unintentional use.&lt;/small&gt;

Groups are everywhere; whether in our social lives, our work, or even our families, individuals decide to work collectively to achieve particular goals. In this book, we take a challenge-based approach, one that focuses on the &quot;how&quot; of managing a group or a team.

It is often remarked that groups are everywhere, whether in our social lives, our work lives, or even our families. In each of these situations, sets of individuals decide to work collectively to achieve particular goals. 

However, although groups are everywhere and we participate in them constantly, we do not understand them very well. Many of us can tell stories of groups that seemed perfect for a given task, but which failed. And we all have reasons (or excuses) that explain such failures. 

But our experiences in groups suffer precisely because we are with them.

The study of groups as a phenomenon that is unique and different from other social phenomena is very active, reflecting both the importance it has and how much we still don't know about groups.

== About this Book ==
[[Image:GroupDiagramMiniC2x4.png|left|thumb|200px|Hub and Spoke]] 
In this book, we take a challenge-based approach to dealing with groups. Many other books provide conceptual and descriptive treatments of groups and teams. Here we will take a prescriptive perspective, one that focuses on the &quot;how to&quot; of managing a group or a team. This prescriptive perspective, however, will be rooted in social science.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Character set ==

The character set used in Ada programs is composed of:

* Upper-case letters: A, ..., Z and lower-case letters: a, ..., z.
* Digits: 0, ..., 9.
* Special characters.

Take into account that in Ada 95 the letter range includes accented characters and other letters used in Western Europe languages, those belonging to the ''[[w:ISO 8859-1|ISO Latin-1]]'' character set, as ç, ñ, ð, etc.

In [[Ada Programming/Ada 2005|Ada 2005]] the character set has been extended to the full [[w:Unicode|Unicode]] set, so the identifiers and comments can be written in almost any language in the world.

Ada is a case-insensitive language, i. e. the upper-case set is equivalent to the lower-case set except in character string literals and character literals.

== Lexical elements ==

In Ada we can find the following lexical elements:

* Identifiers
* Numeric Literals
* Character Literals
* String Literals
* [[../Delimiters|Delimiters]]
* Comments
* [[../Keywords|Reserved Words]]

Example:

 Temperature_In_Room := 25;  {{Ada/--|Temperature to be preserved in the room.}}

This line contains 5 lexical elements:

* The identifier &lt;code&gt;Temperature_In_Room&lt;/code&gt;.
* The compound delimiter &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt;.
* The number &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt;.
* The single delimiter &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;.
* The comment &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/--|Temperature to be preserved in the room.}}&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Identifiers ===

Definition in ''[[Wikipedia:Backus-Naur form|BNF]]'':

 identifier ::= letter { [ underscore ] letter | digit }
 letter ::= A | ... | Z | a | ... | z
 digit ::= 0 | ... | 9
 underscore ::= _

From this definition we must exclude the keywords that are reserved words in the language and cannot be used as identifiers.

Examples:

The following words are legal Ada identifiers:
 Time_Of_Day  TimeOfDay  El_Niño_Forecast  Façade  counter ALARM

The following ones are '''NOT''' legal Ada identifiers:
 _Time_Of_Day  2nd_turn  Start_  Access  Price_In_$  General__Alarm

'''Exercise''': could you give the reason for not being legal for each one of them?

=== Numbers ===

The numeric literals are composed of the following characters:
* digits &lt;code&gt;0 .. 9&lt;/code&gt;
* the decimal separator &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;,
* the exponentiation sign &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;,
* the negative sign &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; (in exponents only) and
* the underscore &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;.

The underscore is used as separator for improving legibility for humans, but it is ignored by the compiler. You can separate numbers following any rationale, e.g. decimal integers in groups of three digits, or binary integers in groups of eight digits.

For example, the real number such as 98.4 can be represented as: &lt;code&gt;9.84E1&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;98.4e0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;984.0e-1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0.984E+2&lt;/code&gt;, but not as &lt;code&gt;984e-1&lt;/code&gt;.

For integer numbers, for example 1900, it could be written as &lt;code&gt;1900&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;19E2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;190e+1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1_900E+0&lt;/code&gt;.

A numeric literal could also be expressed in a base different to 10, by enclosing the number between &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; characters, and preceding it by the base, which can be a number between 2 and 16. For example, &lt;code&gt;2#101#&lt;/code&gt;
is 101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, that is 5&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;; a hexadecimal number with exponent is &lt;code&gt;16#B#E2&lt;/code&gt;, that is 11 &amp;times; 16&amp;sup2; = 2,816.

Note that there are no negative literals; e.g. -1 is not a literal, rather it is the literal 1 preceded by the unary minus operator.

=== Character literals ===

Their type is {{Ada/package|Standard}}.Character, Wide_Character or Wide_Wide_Character. They are delimited by an [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/'|apostrophe (')]].

Examples:

 'A' 'n' '%'

=== String literals ===

[[Ada Programming/Strings|String]] literals are of type {{Ada/package|Standard}}.String, Wide_String or Wide_Wide_String. They are delimited by the 
[[Ada Programming/Special/&quot;|quotation mark (&quot;)]].

Example:

 &quot;This is a string literal&quot;

=== Delimiters ===

Single delimiters are one of the following special characters:

 &amp;    '    (    )    *    +    ,    -    .    /    :    ;    &lt;    =    &gt;    

Compound delimiters are composed of two special characters, and they are the following ones:
 =&gt;    ..    **    :=    /=    &gt;=    &lt;=    &lt;&lt;    &gt;&gt;    &lt;&gt;

You can see a full reference of the delimiters in [[Ada Programming/Delimiters]].

=== Comments ===

Comments in Ada start with two consecutive hyphens (&lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;) and end in the end of line.

 {{Ada/--|This is a comment in a full line}}
 My_Savings := My_Savings * 10.0; {{Ada/--|This is a comment in a line after a sentence}}
 My_Savings := My_Savings * {{Ada/--|This is a comment inserted inside a sentence}}
     1_000_000.0;

A comment can appear where an end of line can be inserted.

=== Reserved words ===

Reserved words are equivalent in upper-case and lower-case letters, although the typical style is the one from the Reference Manual, that is to write them in all lower-case letters.

In Ada some keywords have a different meaning depending on context. You can refer to [[Ada Programming/Keywords]] and the following pages for each keyword.

{{:Template:Ada/Keywords}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">;Biosocial Model of Borderline Personality Disorder

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is primarily a disorder of the emotion regulation system. BPD results from a biological predisposition to emotional dysregulation combined with certain dysfunctional (invalidating) environments which interact over time. The characteristics of BPD begin developing during childhood because the fundamental inability to regulate emotions is exacerbated by an invalidating environment. The vulnerable child fails to learn how to identify feelings or regulate emotional stimulation. She does not learn to trust her private experience as valid and real. BPD individuals fail to learn how to tolerate emotional distress.

As adults, BPD individuals adopt the characteristics of the invalidating environment in which they grow up. Looking to others for accurate reflections of reality and oversimplifying the ease of solving life’s problems characterize this self-invalidation.

Oversimplification of life’s difficulties leads to unrealistic goals. Those with BPD tend to have an inability to use reward instead of punishment for small steps toward final goals. When they fail to achieve these goals they are filled with self-hate.

Those with BPD are generally unable to self-regulate. Those with BPD have difficulty regulating arousal, for example going to bed (sleep) and getting out of bed (awakening). The usually have short attention spans and difficulty concentrating. They often feel overwhelmed when depressed and out of control when anxious. Self-esteem is especially vulnerable as they often feel that their self-esteem is on the line in every situation. Normally, those with healthy self-esteem are able to maintain positive feelings about themselves despite setbacks.

;Emotional Vulnerability

Individuals with BPD have difficulties regulating several, if not all, emotions. They have a very high sensitivity to stimuli – even small things set them off. They respond to even low levels of stress. And when emotionally aroused, they take longer to return to a baseline level of emotion. Thus, they are emotionally vulnerable. The more emotionally vulnerable a person is the more they need to be able to regulate emotion effectively. BPD individuals tend to regulate emotions by either shutting down (avoiding emotions) or escape (intense overreaction). Under the influence of intense (positive or negative) emotions, they are impulsive (unable to inhibit inappropriate behaviors). In other words, they are unable to inhibit mood-dependent actions.

Family members of BPD individuals often feel that they are “walking on eggs” because BPD individuals are so emotionally sensitive and tend to over-react.

Emotional intensity means that emotions are extreme and difficult to regulate. On the negative side, partings may precipitate intense feelings of loss, annoyance may turn into rage, and apprehension may escalate to a panic attack or out of control feelings of terror. On the positive side, they may fall in love at the drop of a hat, experience joy more easily, and be more susceptible to spiritual experiences.

Emotions affect thinking. Emotional arousal narrows the attention. The more emotionally aroused you become, the more pertinent and compelling emotion-relevant material becomes. Therefore, when emotionally aroused, emotions dominate perception, judgment, and behavior. For example, when angered, those with BPD find it hard to let go of thoughts and feelings that reinforce their anger.

“Slow return to emotional baseline” means that emotional reactions are long lasting. Basic normal emotions are fleeting and generally adaptive, lasting only seconds to minutes. For the borderline, emotions are long-lasting because they are amplified with sustained attention and reactivated with memories.

;Emotional Regulation Instead of Dysregulation

Emotional regulation and control includes these activities or abilities:

• Decrease (or increase) physiological arousal associated with emotion. Calming down with relaxation and breathing exercises when angry or anxious. Revving up with depression and sadness.

• Re-orient attention in the presence of strong emotion. To regulate emotions, you must be able to direct the focus of your attention (concentrate) and shift your attention from one thing to another.

• You must be able to inhibit mood dependent behavior. In other words, feel one way and act another. To keep life progressing forward, you must be able to coordinate action in the service of an external, non-mood dependent goal.

• Experience emotions without escalating or blunting. Inhibition of negative emotions serves to increase emotional avoidance. Emotions must be experienced to learn about them. Self-soothing is critical to tolerating intense emotions.

;Invalidating Environments

An invalidating environment is one in which communication of private experiences is met by erratic, inappropriate, and extreme responses. In other words, private experiences are invalidated. Personal expression is punished or trivialized. The environment disregards the experience of painful emotions. Neither are the factors related to expressed emotion appreciated. Also, factors that seem related to the expressed emotion (the person’s experience) are not appreciated. Likewise, the
individual’s interpretations of the emotional distress are dismissed. Finally, the intentions and motivations of the emotional person’s behavior are not considered.

Descriptions of one’s self are not accepted by the environment as an accurate self-description. The invalidating environment does not appreciate one’s behavior as a valid response to events and often criticizes or punishes the individual. Behavior is attributed to socially unacceptable characteristics (e.g. over-reactivity, paranoia, lack of motivation, manipulation, lack of discipline, and failure to adopt a positive attitude).

Apparent calm and competence are valued. Emotionally invalidating environments are generally intolerant of negative displays of affect. Great value is attached to being (or appearing) happy! The message is to never “give in” to hopelessness. Most of all, the power of a “positive mental attitude” will overcome any problem.

Chaotic families may be oriented in this way due to limited resources (money, education, time, emotional or mental stability, etc.). Perfectionistic families overvalue intellectual or rational thinking and undervalue immediate experiencing. “Normal” families are sometimes inadequate for biologically vulnerable individuals.

;The consequences of invalidating environments include:

• The child raised in an invalidating environment does not learn to label private experiences, including emotions, consistent with the larger social community for similar experiences.

• The child is not taught to modulate emotional arousal.

• Emotional problems are not recognized and the child is told to control her emotions without being taught how to do so.

• The solutions to life’s problems are oversimplified so the child does not learn to tolerate distress. Nor does she form realistic goals and expectations.

• Extreme emotional displays are often necessary to provoke a helpful response.

• By punishing communication of negative emotions and intermittently reinforcing displays of extreme emotions, the environment teaches the child to oscillate between emotional inhibition and extreme emotional states.

• An invalidating environment fails to teach the child when to trust her own emotional responses as valid interpretation of events. Rather, the invalidating environment teaches the child to invalidate her own experiences and to search her social environment for cues how to think, feel and act.
Emotion Dysregulation tends to lead to Invalidation and vice versa.

A family which consisted of a slightly vulnerable child with slightly invalidating parents can over time evolve into a highly sensitive vulnerable child and an invalidating family.

A temperamental child, a distractible child, and the persistent child can overwhelm, threaten and disorganize otherwise nurturing parents. Over time, children and caregivers shape and reinforce extreme and coercive behavior in each other. In turn, coercive behaviors further exacerbate the invalidating and coercive system, leading to more, not fewer, dysfunctional behaviors within the entire system.

Understanding BPD reveals how other psychiatric disorders (depression, manic-depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, and attention deficit disorder) affect the development of one’s personality.

== Overview ==

'''''Marge Dursley''''' is sister to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]]. Harry is instructed to refer to her as Aunt Marge. She is most disparaging towards Harry, feeling the imposition on Vernon perhaps more even that Vernon himself does.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

It is mentioned in passing that the house at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] has four bedrooms; one is for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge).

It is mentioned that there is a present from &quot;Auntie Marge&quot; in amongst the presents waiting on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]'s birthday. At first, he doesn't see it, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|his mother]] points it out.

When it transpires that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Mrs. Figg]] has broken her leg and cannot take Harry while Dudley goes to do something on his birthday, Marge is one of the alternates [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Mr. Dursley]] suggests, but Mrs. Dursley points out that &quot;she hates the boy.&quot;

In the same post as the first of Harry's letters is a picture postcard from Marge, who is holidaying on the [[w:Isle of Wight|Isle of Wight]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], appalled at the prospect of a week with his abusive Aunt Marge in the house, makes a deal with his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]]: if he carefully remembers that he is a student at St. Brutus' Home for Incurably Criminal Boys, at the end of the week Uncle Vernon will sign his permission form allowing him to visit the town of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]] on selected weekends.

Aunt Marge arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] with her bulldog in tow, throws her heavy suitcase at Harry to stow in her room, expansively hugs [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]], and gives him £20. When Harry returns from upstairs, he hopes that Aunt Marge will allow him to stay out of range, but she says that she doesn't trust him out of her sight and insists on details about the school he is attending.

At one point during the week, when she is being particularly insulting to wards Harry, a wine glass Aunt Marge is holding shatters in her hands. She passes it off as just that she has strong hands; Uncle Vernon seems to suspect that Harry is doing magic. Harry is unsure himself as to whether he caused it.

On the last day that Aunt Marge is there, possibly fueled by brandy, she starts insulting Harry's parents. This is too much for Harry to bear, and without his having willed it, Aunt Marge starts inflating. Not being entirely certain how he had done this, Harry cannot undo it; instead, he unlocks the closet under the stairs, and escapes with his school things.

Reaching the Leaky Cauldron, in fear that he will be recognized and have his wand broken for underage use of magic, Harry is amazed to meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|the Minister for Magic]] there. Fudge tells him that Aunt Marge has been deflated, and her memory adjusted; there will be no charges laid, it could have happened to anyone.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

While being trained in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], one of the memories that Snape retrieves from Harry's mind is an episode where Aunt Marge had allowed her bulldog to chase Harry up a tree, and had left him there for hours, laughing at him.

== Strengths ==

We can guess that Marge is a very strong-willed woman. It appears she is unmarried, and is able to support herself, though we don't learn how.

== Weaknesses ==

Marge is clearly unable to perceive when she is being insulting. She is basically oblivious to the effects her words have on others.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Marge quite clearly prides herself on being &quot;frank&quot;, speaking her opinion no matter how hurtful it is. She does not recognize that she is bigoted, or that she is needlessly causing pain to others by what she says. Because of this, it seems that the only people with whom she can stay on more or less friendly terms are those, like the off-stage Colonel Fubster, who share her opinions, and those like Vernon Dursley, who are forced to keep up a relationship through being family.

== Analysis ==

In the short time we see her, we learn that Marge is loud, bigoted, prejudiced against Harry and his parents for no good reason, and at the very least, well on the road to becoming alcoholic. We also learn that she has no qualms about airing her opinions, no matter how those around her might take them, and is apparently insensitive to atmosphere, not noticing when she is being warned about straying into dangerous or hurtful areas of speech. It is perhaps appropriate that when Harry loses control, he ends up inflating her; she is, it seems, full of hot air already.

We note that Colonel Fubster only merits about half a sentence. We can guess from his name alone that he is one of the very few sorts of people who are likely to be able to stand Marge: equally bigoted, and seeing expression of these parochial and bigoted ideas as being &quot;bold&quot; or &quot;frank&quot;. We wonder how long it took to come up with such an appropriate name, one that would condense his probable character into such small compass.

It seems fairly common for addiction of any sort to have, as a side effect, the numbing of perception of others' feelings. When the most important thing in life becomes the next drink, the opinions of people around you, and their feelings, will become unimportant in relation. If Marge is an incipient or active alcoholic, as her portrayal would indicate, it is possible that this unfeeling attitude towards Harry is a part of that alcoholism. One wonders if the author is writing Marge's characteristics from personal experience.

Some may be aware that some mental ailments, notably autism spectrum disorders, also show a lack of perception, or understanding, of other people's feelings. Experience suggests that these disorders tend to result in disregard for others, rather than the actual verbal attacks we see repeatedly from Marge. We believe that Marge Dursley was written to simply be as hateful a person as possible.

This move is normally from the initial position (when the men are facing anti-clockwise).

Usually, the leader walks backwards, and the follower walks forwards, in normal
salsa timing, but keeping within the circle.

It can also be used from the [[Rueda de Casino/Guapea|Guapea]] position to revert to the initial position, and carry on doing Abajo as normal.

* Note that abajo can be added on to a number of other moves to reverse their direction.

{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/namespace}}

===== using namespaces =====
;using
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
using namespace std;
&lt;/source&gt;

This &lt;tt&gt;using&lt;/tt&gt;-directive indicates that any names used but not declared within the program should be sought in the ‘standard (std)' {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}.  

{{NOTE|It is always a bad idea to use a &lt;tt&gt;using&lt;/tt&gt; directive in a header file, as it affects every use of that header file and would make difficult its use in other derived projects; there is no way to &quot;undo&quot; or restrict the use of that directive. Also don't use it before an &lt;tt&gt;#include&lt;/tt&gt; directive.}}

To make a single name from a {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} available, the following &lt;tt&gt;using&lt;/tt&gt;-declaration exists:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
using foo::bar;
&lt;/source&gt;

After this declaration, the name &lt;tt&gt;bar&lt;/tt&gt; can be used inside the current {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} instead of the more verbose version &lt;tt&gt;foo::bar&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that programmers often use the terms declaration and directive interchangeably, despite their technically different meanings. 

It is good practice to use the narrow second form (using declaration), because the broad first form (using directive) might make more names available than desired. Example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
namespace foo {
  int bar;
  double pi;
}
 
using namespace foo;
 
int* pi;
pi = &amp;bar;  // ambiguity: pi or foo::pi?
&lt;/source&gt;

In that case the declaration &lt;tt&gt;using foo::bar;&lt;/tt&gt; would have made only &lt;tt&gt;foo::bar&lt;/tt&gt; available, avoiding the clash of &lt;tt&gt;pi&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;foo::pi&lt;/tt&gt;. This problem (the collision of identically-named variables or functions) is called &quot;namespace pollution&quot; and as a rule should be avoided wherever possible.

&lt;tt&gt;using&lt;/tt&gt;-declarations can appear in a lot of different places. Among them are:

* namespaces (including the default namespace)
* functions

A &lt;tt&gt;using&lt;/tt&gt;-declaration makes the name (or {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}) available in the scope of the declaration. Example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
namespace foo {
  namespace bar {
   double pi;
  }

  using bar::pi;
  // bar::pi can be abbreviated as pi
}
 
// here, pi is no longer an abbreviation. Instead, foo::bar::pi must be used.
&lt;/source&gt;

Namespaces are hierarchical.  Within the hypothetical {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} &lt;tt&gt;food::fruit&lt;/tt&gt;, the identifier &lt;tt&gt;orange&lt;/tt&gt; refers to &lt;tt&gt;food::fruit::orange&lt;/tt&gt; if it exists, or if not, then &lt;tt&gt;food::orange&lt;/tt&gt; if that exists. If neither exist, &lt;tt&gt;orange&lt;/tt&gt; refers to an identifier in the default {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}.

Code that is not explicitly declared within a {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} is considered to be in the '''''default namespace'''''.

Another property of namespaces is that they are ''open''. Once a {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} is declared, it can be redeclared (''reopened'') and {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} members can be added. Example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
namespace foo {
  int bar;
}
 
// ...
 
namespace foo {
  double pi;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Namespaces are most often used to avoid naming collisions.  Although namespaces are used extensively in recent C++ code, most older code does not use this facility.  For example, the entire standard library is defined within {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} &lt;tt&gt;std&lt;/tt&gt;, and in earlier standards of the language, in the '''''default namespace'''''.

For a long '''''namespace name''''', a shorter alias can be defined (a {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} &lt;i&gt;alias&lt;i&gt; declaration). Example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
namespace ultra_cool_library_for_image_processing_version_1_0 {
  int foo;
}
 
namespace improc1 = ultra_cool_library_for_image_processing_version_1_0;
// from here, the above foo can be accessed as improc1::foo
&lt;/source&gt;

There exists a special {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}: the '''''unnamed namespace'''''. This {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} is used for names which are private to a particular source file or other {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
namespace {
  int some_private_variable;
}
// can use some_private_variable here
&lt;/source&gt;

In the surrounding scope, members of an '''''unnamed namespace''''' can be accessed without qualifying, i.e. without prefixing with the namespace name and &lt;tt&gt;::&lt;/tt&gt; (since the namespace doesn't have a name).  If the surrounding scope is a {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}, members can be treated and accessed as a member of it.  However, if the surrounding scope is a file, members cannot be accessed from any other source file, as there is no way to name the file as a scope.  An '''''unnamed namespace''''' declaration is semantically equivalent to the following construct

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
namespace $$$ {
  // ...
}
using namespace $$$;
&lt;/source&gt;

where &lt;tt&gt;$$$&lt;/tt&gt; is a unique identifier manufactured by the compiler.

As you can nest an '''''unnamed namespace''''' in an ordinary {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}, and vice versa, you can also nest two unnamed namespaces. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
namespace {

  namespace {
    // ok
  }

}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|If you enable the use of a {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} in the code, all the code will use it (you can't define sections that will and exclude others), you can however use '''''nested namespace''''' declarations to restrict its scope.
}}

Because of space considerations, we cannot actually show the {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} command being used properly: it would require a very large program to show it working usefully. However, we can illustrate the concept itself easily.
 
{{:C++ Programming/Scope/Examples/Program Namespaces}}

We will examine the code moving from the start down to the end of the program, examining fragments of it in turn.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This just includes the iostream library so that we can use &lt;tt&gt;std::cout&lt;/tt&gt; to print stuff to the screen.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
namespace first {
  int first1;
  int x;
}

namespace second {
  int second1;
  int x;
}

namespace first {
  int first2;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We create a namespace called ''first'' and add to it two variables, ''first1'' and ''x''. Then we close it. Then we create a new namespace called ''second'' and put two variables in it: ''second1'' and ''x''. Then we re-open the {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} ''first'' and add another variable called ''first2'' to it. A {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} can be re-opened in this manner as often as desired to add in extra names. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
  main(){
1  //first1 = 1;
2  first::first1 = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

The first line of the main program is commented out because it would cause an error. In order to get at a name from the first {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}, we must qualify the variable's name with the name of its {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} before it and two colons; hence the second line of the main program is not a syntax error. The name of the variable is in scope: it just has to be referred to in that particular way before it can be used at this point. This therefore cuts up the list of global names into groups, each group with its own prefixing name.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
3  using namespace first;
4  first1 = 1;
5  x = 1;
6  second::x = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

The third line of the main program introduces the ''using namespace'' command. This commands pulls all the names in the first {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} into scope. They can then be used in the usual way from there on. Hence the fourth and fifth lines of the program compile without error. In particular, the variable ''x'' is available now: in order to address the other variable ''x'' in the second {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}, we would call it ''second::x'' as shown in line six. Thus the two variables called ''x'' can be separately referred to, as they are on the fifth and sixth lines.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
7  using namespace second;
8  //x = 1;
9  first::x = 1;
10 second::x = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

We then pull the declarations in the {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} called ''second'' in, again with the ''using namespace'' command. The line following is commented out because it is now an error (whereas before it was correct). Since both namespaces have been brought into the global list of names, the variable ''x'' is now ambiguous, and needs to be talked about only in the qualified manner illustrated in the ninth and tenth lines. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
11 first2 = 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

The eleventh line of the main program shows that even though ''first2'' was declared in a separate section of the {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} called ''first'', it has the same status as the other variables in {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} ''first''. A {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} can be re-opened as many times as you wish. The usual rules of scoping apply, of course: it is not legal to try to declare the same name twice in the same {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
12 //cout &lt;&lt; 'X';
13 std::cout &lt;&lt; 'X';
14 using namespace std;
15 cout &lt;&lt; 'X';
}
&lt;/source&gt;

There is a {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} defined in the computer in special group of files. Its name is ''std'' and all the system-supplied names, such as ''cout'', are declared in that {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} in a number of different files: it is a very large namespace. Note that the ''#include'' statement at the very top of the program does not fully bring the {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} in: the names are there but must still be referred to in qualified form. Line twelve has to be commented out because currently the system-supplied names like ''cout'' are not available, except in the qualified form ''std::cout'' as can be seen in line thirteen. Thus we need a line like the fourteenth line: after that line is written, all the system-supplied names are available, as illustrated in the last line of the program. At this point we have the names of three {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} incorporated into the program.

As the example program illustrates, the declarations that are needed are brought in as desired, and the unwanted ones are left out, and can be brought in in a controlled manner using the qualified form with the double colons. This gives the greater control of names needed for large programs. In the example above, we used only the names of variables. However, namespaces also control, equally, the names of procedures and classes, as desired.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Structures==
A simple implementation of the object paradigm from (OOP) that holds collections of data records (also known as ''compound values'' or ''set''). A &lt;tt&gt;struct&lt;/tt&gt; is like a class '''except for the default access''' (class has default access of private, struct has default access of public). C++ also guarantees that a struct that only contains C types is equivalent to the same C struct thus allowing access to legacy C functions, it can (but may not) also have constructors (and must have them, if a templated class is used inside a &lt;tt&gt;struct&lt;/tt&gt;), as with Classes the compiler implicitly-declares a destructor if the struct doesn’t have a user-declared destructor. Structures will also allow [[C++ Programming/Operators/Operator Overloading|Operator Overloading]].

A struct is ''defined'' by:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct myStructType /*: inheritances */ {
public: 
 // public members
protected:
 // protected members
private:
 // private members
} myStructName;
&lt;/source&gt;

Because it is not supported in C, it is uncommon to have structs in C++ using inheritances even though they are supported just like in classes. The more distinctive aspect is that structs can have two identities one is in reference to the type and another to the specific object.
The public access label can sometimes be ignored since the default state of struct for member functions and fields is public.

An object of type ''myStructType'' (case-sensitive) is ''declared'' using:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 myStructType obj1;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br&gt;{{NOTE|From a technical viewpoint, a struct and a class are practically the same thing. A struct can be used anywhere a class can be and vice-versa, the only technical difference is that class members default to ''private'' and struct members default to ''public''. Structs can be made to behave like classes simply by putting in the keyword private at the beginning of the struct. Other than that it is mostly a difference regarding convention and programming design, often an indication of a conversion from a C language source code or even used as an improper implicit indication that the structure will not be inherited or will not have function members (this use should be avoided and never assumed).}}

; Why should you Use Structs, Not Classes?
Older programmer languages used a similar type called Record (i.e.: COBOL, FORTRAN) this was implemented in C as the struct keyword. And so C++ uses structs to comply with this C's heritage (the code and the programmers). Structs are simpler to be managed by the programmer and the compiler. One should use a &lt;tt&gt;struct&lt;/tt&gt; for POD ([[c2:PlainOldData|PlainOldData]]) types that have no methods and whose data members are all &lt;tt&gt;public&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;tt&gt;struct&lt;/tt&gt; may be used more efficiently in situations that default to public inheritance (which is the most common kind) and where &lt;tt&gt;public&lt;/tt&gt; access (which is what you want if you list the public interface first) is the intended effect. Using a &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt;, you typically have to insert the keyword public in two places, for no real advantage. In the end it's just a matter of convention, which programmers should be able to get used to.

; Point objects :
As a simple example of a compound structure, consider the concept of a mathematical point. At one level, a point is two numbers (coordinates) that we treat collectively as a single object. In mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses, with a comma separating the coordinates. For example, (0, 0) indicates the origin, and (x, y) indicates the point x units to the right and y units up from the origin.

The natural way to represent a point is using two doubles. The '''structure''' or &lt;tt&gt;struct&lt;/tt&gt; is one of the solutions to group these two values into a compound object.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// A struct definition:
 struct Point { 
   double x, y; }; 
&lt;/source&gt;

This definition indicates that this structure contains two members, named &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt;. These members are also called instance variables, for reasons I will explain a little later.

It is a common error to leave off the semi-colon at the end of a structure definition. It might seem odd to put a semi-colon after a squiggly-brace, but you'll get used to it. This syntax is in place to allow the programmer the facility to create an instance[s] of the struct when it is defined.

Once you have defined the new structure, you can create variables with that type:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
struct Point blank; 
blank.x = 3.0; 
blank.y = 4.0; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The first line is a conventional variable declaration: blank has type Point. The next two lines initialize the instance variables of the structure. The &quot;dot notation&quot; used here is similar to the syntax for invoking a function on an object, as in &lt;tt&gt;fruit.length()&lt;/tt&gt;. Of course, one difference is that function names are always followed by an argument list, even if it is empty.

As usual, the name of the variable blank appears outside the box and its value appears inside the box. In this case, that value is a compound object with two named instance variables.

; Accessing instance variables :
You can read the values of an instance variable using the same syntax we used to write them:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int x = blank.x; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The expression &lt;tt&gt;blank.x&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;go to the object named blank and get the value of the member named x.&quot; In this case we assign that value to a local variable named &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;. Notice that there is no conflict between the local variable named &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and the instance variable named &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;. The purpose of dot notation is to identify which variable you are referring to unambiguously.

You can use dot notation as part of any expression, so the following are legal.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
cout &lt;&lt; blank.x &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; blank.y &lt;&lt; endl; 
double distance = sqrt(blank.x * blank.x + blank.y * blank.y); 
&lt;/source&gt;

The first line outputs 3, 4; the second line calculates the value 5.

; Operations on structures :
Most of the operators we have been using on other types, like mathematical operators ( &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.) and comparison operators (&lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.), do not work on structures. Actually, it is possible to define the meaning of these operators for the new type, but we won't do that in this book.

On the other hand, the assignment operator does work for structures. It can be used in two ways: to initialize the instance variables of a structure or to copy the instance variables from one structure to another. An initialization looks like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Point blank = { 3.0, 4.0 }; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The values in curly brackets get assigned to the instance variables of the structure one by one, in order. So in this case, &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; gets the first value and y gets the second.

Unfortunately, this syntax can be used only in an initialization, not in an assignment statement. Therefore, the following is illegal.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Point blank; 
blank = { 3.0, 4.0 }; // WRONG !! 
&lt;/source&gt;

You might wonder why this perfectly reasonable statement should be illegal, and there is no good answer.  (Note, however, that a ''similar'' syntax is legal in C since 1999, and is under consideration for possible inclusion in C++ in the future.)

On the other hand, it is legal to assign one structure to another. For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Point p1 = { 3.0, 4.0 }; 
Point p2 = p1; 
cout &lt;&lt; p2.x &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt;  p2.y &lt;&lt; endl; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The output of this program is &lt;code&gt;3, 4&lt;/code&gt;.

; Structures as return types :
You can write functions that return structures. For example, findCenter takes a Rectangle as an argument and returns a Point that contains the coordinates of the center of the Rectangle:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Point findCenter (Rectangle&amp; box) 
{ 
  double x = box.corner.x + box.width/2; 
  double y = box.corner.y + box.height/2; 
  Point result = {x, y}; 
  return result; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

To call this function, we have to pass a box as an argument (notice that it is being passed by reference), and assign the return value to a Point variable:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Rectangle box = { {0.0, 0.0}, 100, 200 }; 
Point center = findCenter (box); 
printPoint (center); 
&lt;/source&gt;

The output of this program is (50, 100).

; Passing other types by reference :
It's not just structures that can be passed by reference. All the other types we've seen can, too. For example, to swap two integers, we could write something like:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void swap (int&amp; x, int&amp; y) 
{ 
  int temp = x; 
  x = y; 
  y = temp; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

We would call this function in the usual way:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int i = 7; 
int j = 9; 
swap (i, j); 
cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; j &lt;&lt; endl; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The output of this program is 97. Draw a stack diagram for this program to convince yourself this is true. If the parameters x and y were declared as regular parameters (without the &amp;s), swap would not work. It would modify x and y and have no effect on i and j.

When people start passing things like integers by reference, they often try to use an expression as a reference argument. For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int i = 7; 
int j = 9; 
swap (i, j+1); // WRONG!! 
&lt;/source&gt;

This is not legal because the expression &lt;tt&gt;j+1&lt;/tt&gt; is not a variable — it does not occupy a location that the reference can refer to. It is a little tricky to figure out exactly what kinds of expressions can be passed by reference. For now, a good rule of thumb is that reference arguments have to be variables.

;Pointers and structures:
Structures can also be pointed by pointers and store pointers. The rules are the same as for any fundamental data type. The pointer must be declared as a pointer to the structure.

=== Nesting structures ===
Structures can also be nested so that a valid element of a structure can also be another structure.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
//of course you have to define the Point struct first!

struct Rectangle {
 Point upper_left; 
 Point upper_right;
 Point lower_left;
 Point lower_right;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== this ===
The '''this''' keyword is an implicitly created pointer that is only accessible within nonstatic member functions of a struct (or a union or class) and points to the object for which the member function is called. This pointer is not available in static member functions. This will be restated again on when introducing unions a more in depth analysis is provided in the [[C++ Programming/Classes/this|Section about classes]].

{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/union}}

=== Writing to Different Bytes ===

Unions are very useful for low-level programming tasks that involve writing to the same memory area but at different portions of the allocated memory space, for instance:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
union item 
{
  // The item is 16-bits
  short theItem;

  // In little-endian lo accesses the low 8-bits -
  // hi, the upper 8-bits
  struct { char lo; char hi; } portions;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|A name for the struct declared in item can be omitted because it is not used. All that needs to be explicitly named is the parts that we intend to access, namely the instance itself, portions.}}

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
  item tItem;
  tItem.theItem = 0xBEAD;
  tItem.portions.lo = 0xEF; // The item now equals 0xBEEF
&lt;/source&gt;

Using this union we can modify the low-order or high-order bytes of theItem without disturbing any other bytes.

=== Example in Practice: SDL Events ===
One real-life example of unions is the event system of SDL, a graphics library in C. In graphical programming, an event is an action triggered by the user, such as a mouse move or keyboard press. One of the SDL's responsibilities is to handle events and provide a mechanism for the programmer to listen for and react to them.

{{NOTE|The following section deals with a library in C rather than C++, so some features, such as methods of objects, are not used here. However C++ is more-or-less a superset of C, so you can understand the code with the knowledge you have gained so far.}}

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// primary event structure in SDL

typedef union 
{
  Uint8 type;
  SDL_ActiveEvent active;
  SDL_KeyboardEvent key;
  SDL_MouseMotionEvent motion;
  SDL_MouseButtonEvent button;
  SDL_JoyAxisEvent jaxis;
  SDL_JoyBallEvent jball;
  SDL_JoyHatEvent jhat;
  SDL_JoyButtonEvent jbutton;
  SDL_ResizeEvent resize;
  SDL_ExposeEvent expose;
  SDL_QuitEvent quit;
  SDL_UserEvent user;
  SDL_SysWMEvent syswm;
} SDL_Event;
&lt;/source&gt;

Each of the types other than &lt;tt&gt;Uint8&lt;/tt&gt; (an 8-bit {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} integer) is a struct with details for that particular event.  

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// SDL_MouseButtonEvent

typedef struct
{
  Uint8 type;
  Uint8 button;
  Uint8 state;
  Uint16 x, y;
} SDL_MouseButtonEvent;
&lt;/source&gt;

When the programmer receives an event from SDL, he first checks the type value. This tells him what kind of an event it is. Based on this value, he either ignores the event or gets more information by getting the appropriate part of the union.

For example, if the programmer received an event in &lt;tt&gt;SDL_Event ev&lt;/tt&gt;, he could react to mouse clicks with the following code.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (ev.type == SDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP &amp;&amp; ev.button.button == SDL_BUTTON_RIGHT) 
{
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;You have right-clicked at coordinates (&quot; &lt;&lt; ev.button.x &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot;
       &lt;&lt; ev.button.y &lt;&lt; &quot;).&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|As each of the SDL_SomethingEvent structs contain a &lt;tt&gt;Uint8 type&lt;/tt&gt; entry, it is safe to access both &lt;tt&gt;Uint8 type&lt;/tt&gt; and the corresponding sub-struct together.}}

While identical functionality can be provided with a struct rather than a union, the union is far more space efficient; the struct would use memory for each of the different event types, whereas the union only uses memory for one. As only one entry has meaning per instance, it is reasonable to use a union in this case.

This scheme could also be constructed with polymorphism and inheritance features of object-oriented C++, however the setup would be involved and less efficient than this one. Use of unions loses type safety, however it gains in performance.

=== this ===
The this keyword is a implicitly created pointer that is only accessible within nonstatic member functions of a union (or a struct or class ) and points to the object for which the member function is called. The this pointer is not available in static member functions. This will be restated again on when introducing unions a more in depth analysis is provided in the [[C++ Programming/Classes/this|Section about classes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Exception Handling ==
[[w:Exception handling|Exception handling]] is a construct designed to handle the occurrence of exceptions, that is special conditions that changes the normal flow of program execution. Since when designing a programming task (a class or even a function), one cannot always assume that application/task will run or be completed correctly (exit with the result it was intended to). It may be the case that it will be just inappropriate for that given task to report an error message (return an error code) or just exit. To handle these types of cases, C++ supports the use of language constructs to separate error handling and reporting code from ordinary code, that is, constructs that can deal with these '''exceptions''' (errors and abnormalities) and so we call this global approach that adds uniformity to program design the '''exception handling'''.

An exception is said to be '''thrown''' at the place where some error or abnormal condition is detected. The throwing will cause the normal program flow to be aborted, in a '''raised exception'''. An exception is thrown programmatic, the programmer specifies the conditions of a throw.

In '''handled exceptions''', execution of the program will resume at a designated block of code, called a '''catch block''', which encloses the point of throwing in terms of program execution. The catch block can be, and usually is, located in a different function/method than the point of throwing. In this way, C++ supports ''non-local error handling''. Along with altering the program flow, throwing of an exception passes an object to the catch block. This object can provide data that is necessary for the handling code to decide in which way it should react on the exception.

Consider this next code example of a '''try''' and '''catch''' block combination for clarification:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void AFunction()
{
    // This function does not return normally, 
    // instead execution will resume at a catch block.
    // The thrown object is in this case of the type char const*,
    // i.e. it is a C-style string. More usually, exception
    // objects are of class type.
    throw &quot;This is an exception!&quot;; 
}

void AnotherFunction()
{
    // To catch exceptions, you first have to introduce
    // a try block via &quot; try { ... } &quot;. Then multiple catch
    // blocks can follow the try block.
    // &quot; try { ... } catch(type 1) { ... } catch(type 2) { ... }&quot;
    try 
    {
        AFunction();
       // Because the function throws an exception,
       // the rest of the code in this block will not
       // be executed
    }
    catch(char const* pch)  // This catch block 
                            // will react on exceptions
                            // of type char const*
    {
        // Execution will resume here.
        // You can handle the exception here.
    }
               // As can be seen
    catch(...) // The ellipsis indicates that this
               // block will catch exceptions of any type. 
    {
       // In this example, this block will not be executed,
       // because the preceding catch block is chosen to 
       // handle the exception.
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Unhandled exceptions''' on the other hand will result in a function termination and the [[#Stack unwinding|stack will be unwound]] (stack allocated objects will have destructors called) as it looks for an exception handler. If none is found it will ultimately result in the termination of the program.

From the point of view of a programmer, raising an exception is a useful way to signal that a routine could not execute normally. For example, when an input argument is invalid (e.g. a zero denominator in division) or when a resource it relies on is unavailable (like a missing file, or a hard disk error). In systems without exceptions, routines would need to return some special error code. However, this is sometimes complicated by the [[w:semipredicate problem|semi-predicate problem]], in which users of the routine need to write extra code to distinguish normal return values from erroneous ones.

Because it is hard to write exception safe code, you should only use an exception when you have to—when an error has occurred that you can not handle. Do ''not'' use exceptions for the normal flow of the program.

This example is ''wrong'', it is a demonstration on what to avoid: 
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void sum(int iA, int iB)
{
    throw iA + iB;
}

int main()
{
    int iResult;

    try 
    {
        sum(2, 3);
    }
    catch(int iTmpResult)  
    {
        // Here the exception is used instead of a return value!
        // This is  wrong!
        iResult = iTmpResult;
    }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Stack unwinding ===
Consider the following code
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void g()
{ 
    throw std::exception();
}
 
void f()
{
    std::string str = &quot;Hello&quot;; // This string is newly allocated
    g();
}
 
int main()
{
    try
    {
        f();
    }
    catch(...) 
    { }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The flow of the program:
* &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; creates a local variable named &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; constructor allocates a memory chunk to hold the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code&gt;g()&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;g()&lt;/code&gt;throws an exception
* &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; does not catch the exception. 
: Because the exception was not caught, we now need to exit &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; in a clean fashion.
: At this point, all the destructors of local variables previous to the throw
: are called—This is called 'stack unwinding'.
* The destructor of &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; is called, which releases the memory occupied by it. 
: As you can see, the mechanism of 'stack unwinding' is essential to prevent resource leaks—without it, &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; would never be destroyed, and the memory it used would be lost until the end of the program (even until the next loss of power, or [[w:Reboot (computing)|cold boot]] depending on the Operative System memory management).
* &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; catches the exception
* The program continues.

The 'stack unwinding' guarantees destructors of local variables (stack variables) will be called
when we leave its scope.

=== Throwing objects ===
There are several ways to throw an exception object.

Throw a pointer to the object:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void foo()
{
    throw new MyApplicationException();
}

void bar()
{
    try 
    {
        foo();
    }
    catch(MyApplicationException* e)
    {
        // Handle exception
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

But now, who is responsible to delete the exception? The handler? This makes code uglier. There must be a better way!

How about this:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void foo()
{
    throw MyApplicationException();
}

void bar()
{
    try 
    {
        foo();
    }
    catch(MyApplicationException e)
    {
        // Handle exception
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Looks better! But now, the catch handler that catches the exception, does it by value, meaning that a copy constructor is called. This can cause the program to crash if the exception caught was a &lt;code&gt;bad_alloc&lt;/code&gt; caused by insufficient memory. In such a situation, seemingly safe code that is assumed to handle memory allocation problems results in the program crashing with a failure of the exception handler. Moreover, catching by value may cause the copy to have different behavior because of object slicing.

The correct approach is:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void foo()
{
    throw MyApplicationException();
}

void bar()
{
    try 
    {
        foo();
    }
    catch(MyApplicationException const&amp; e)
    {
        // Handle exception
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This method has all the advantages—the compiler is responsible for destroying the object, and no copying is done at catch time!

The conclusion is that exceptions should be thrown by value, and caught by (usually const) reference.

=== Constructors and destructors ===
When an exception is thrown from a constructor, the object is not considered instantiated, and therefore its destructor will ''not'' be called. But all destructors of already successfully constructed base and member objects of the same master object will be called. Destructors of not yet constructed base or member objects of the same master object will not be executed. Example:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
class A : public B, public C
{
public:
    D sD;
    E sE;
    A(void)
    :B(), C(), sD(), sE()
    {
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's assume the constructor of base class C throws. Then the order of execution is: 
* &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; (throws)
* &lt;code&gt;~B&lt;/code&gt;

Let's assume the constructor of member object sE throws. Then the order of execution is:
* &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;sD&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;sE&lt;/code&gt; (throws)
* &lt;code&gt;~sD&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;~C&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;~B&lt;/code&gt;
Thus if some constructor is executed, one can rely on that all other constructors of the same master object executed before, were successful. This enables one, to use an already constructed member or base object as an argument for the constructor of one of the following member or base objects of the same master object.

What happens when we allocate this object with ''&lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;''?
* Memory for the object is allocated
* The object's constructor throws an exception
** The object was not instantiated due to the exception
* The memory occupied by the object is deleted
* The exception is propagated, until it is caught

The main purpose of throwing an exception from a constructor is to inform the program/user that the creation and initialization of the object did not finish correctly. This is a very clean way of providing this important information, as constructors do not return a separate value containing some error code (as an initialization function might).

In contrast, it is strongly recommended not to throw exceptions inside a destructor. It is important to note when a destructor is called: 
* as part of a normal deallocation (exit from a scope, delete)
* as part of a stack unwinding that handles a previously thrown exception. 

In the former case, throwing an exception inside a destructor can simply cause memory leaks due to incorrectly deallocated object. In the latter, the code must be more clever. If an exception was thrown as part of the stack unwinding caused by another exception, there is no way to choose which exception to handle first. This is interpreted as a failure of the exception handling mechanism and that causes the program to call the function terminate.

To address this problem, it is possible to test if the destructor was called as part of an exception handling process. To this end, one should use the standard library function uncaught_exception, which returns true if an exception has been thrown, but hasn't been caught yet. All code executed in such a situation must not throw another exception.

Situations where such careful coding is necessary are extremely rare. It is far safer and easier to debug if the code was written in such a way that destructors did not throw exceptions at all.

=== Writing exception safe code ===
;Exception safety
A piece of code is said to be '''exception-safe''', if run-time failures within the code will not produce ill effects, such as [[w:memory leak|memory leak]]s, garbled stored data, or invalid output. Exception-safe code must satisfy [[w:Invariant (computer science)|invariant]]s placed on the code even if exceptions occur. There are several levels of exception safety:
# '''Failure transparency''', also known as the '''no throw guarantee''': Operations are guaranteed to succeed and satisfy all requirements even in presence of exceptional situations. If an exception occurs, it will not throw the exception further up. (Best level of exception safety.)
# '''Commit or rollback semantics''', also known as '''strong exception safety''' or '''no-change guarantee''': Operations can fail, but failed operations are guaranteed to have no side effects so all data retain original values.
# '''Basic exception safety''': Partial execution of failed operations can cause side effects, but invariants on the state are preserved. Any stored data will contain valid values even if data has different values now from before the exception.
# '''Minimal exception safety''' also known as '''no-leak guarantee''': Partial execution of failed operations may store invalid data but will not cause a crash, and no resources get leaked.
# '''No exception safety''': No guarantees are made. (Worst level of exception safety)

==== Partial handling ====
Consider the following case:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void g()
{
    throw &quot;Exception&quot;;
}
  
void f()
{
    int* pI = new int(0);
    g();
    delete pI;
}

int main()
{
    f();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Can you see the problem in this code? If &lt;code&gt;g()&lt;/code&gt; throws an exception, the variable &lt;code&gt;pI&lt;/code&gt; is never deleted and we have a memory leak.

To prevent the memory leak, &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; must catch the exception, and delete &lt;code&gt;pI&lt;/code&gt;.
But &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; can't handle the exception, it doesn't know how! 

What is the solution then? &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; shall catch the exception, and then re-throw it:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void g()
{
    throw &quot;Exception&quot;;
}
  
void f()
{
    int* pI = new int(0);

    try
    {
        g();
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        delete pI;
        throw; // This empty throw re-throws the exception we caught
               // An empty throw can only exist in a catch block
    }

    delete pI;
}

int main()
{
    f();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

There's a better way though; using '''RAII''' classes to avoid the need to use exception handling.

===== Guards =====
If you plan to use exceptions in your code, you must always try to write your code in an exception safe manner. Let's see some of the problems that can occur:

Consider the following code:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void g()
{ 
    throw std::exception();
}
 
void f()
{
    int* pI = new int(2);

    *pI = 3;
    g();
    // Oops, if an exception is thrown, pI is never deleted
    // and we have a memory leak
    delete pI;
}
 
int main()
{
    try
    {
        f();
    } 
    catch(...) 
    { }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Can you see the problem in this code? When an exception is thrown, we will never run the line that deletes &lt;code&gt;pI&lt;/code&gt;!

What's the solution to this? Earlier we saw a solution based on &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt; ability to catch and re-throw. But there is a neater solution using the 'stack unwinding' mechanism.
But 'stack unwinding' only applies to destructors for objects, so how can we use it?

We can write a simple wrapper class:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
 // Note: This type of class is best implemented using templates, discussed in the next chapter.
 class IntDeleter {
 public:
    IntDeleter(int* piValue)
    {
        m_piValue = piValue;
    }
    
    ~IntDeleter() 
    {
        delete m_piValue;
    }
  
    // operator *, enables us to dereference the object and use it
    // like a regular pointer.
    int&amp;  operator *() 
    {
        return *m_piValue;
    }

 private:
     int* m_piValue;
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

The new version of &lt;code&gt;f()&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
 void f()
 {
   IntDeleter pI(new int(2));

   *pI = 3;
   g();
   // No need to delete pI, this will be done in destruction.
   // This code is also exception safe.
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
The pattern presented here is called a ''guard''. A guard is very useful in other cases, and it can also help us make our code more exception safe. The guard pattern is similar to a ''finally'' block in other languages.

Note that the C++ Standard Library provides a templated guard by the name of unique_ptr.

==== Exception hierarchy ====
You may throw as exception an object (like a class or string), a pointer (like &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt;), or a primitive (like &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;). So, which should you choose?
You should throw objects, as they ease the handling of exceptions for the programmer. It is common to create a class hierarchy of exception classes:
* class MyApplicationException {};
** class MathematicalException : public MyApplicationException {};
*** class DivisionByZeroException : public MathematicalException {};
** class InvalidArgumentException : public MyApplicationException {};

An example:
&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
float divide(float fNumerator, float fDenominator)
{
    if (fDenominator == 0.0)
    {
        throw DivisionByZeroException();
    }

    return fNumerator/fDenominator;
}

enum MathOperators {DIVISION, PRODUCT};

float operate(int iAction, float fArgLeft, float fArgRight)
{ 
    if (iAction == DIVISION)
    {
        return divide(fArgLeft, fArgRight);
    }
    else if (iAction == PRODUCT))
    {
        // call the product function
        // ... 
    }

    // No match for the action! iAction is an invalid agument
    throw InvalidArgumentException(); 
}
 
int main(int iArgc, char* a_pchArgv[])
{
    try
    {
        operate(atoi(a_pchArgv[0]), atof(a_pchArgv[1]), atof(a_pchArgv[2]));
    } 
    catch(MathematicalException&amp; )
    {
        // Handle Error
    }
    catch(MyApplicationException&amp; )
    {
        // This will catch in InvalidArgumentException too.
        // Display help to the user, and explain about the arguments.
    }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|The order of the catch blocks is important. A thrown object (say, InvalidArgumentException) can be caught in a catch block of one of its super-classes.
(e.g. &lt;code&gt;catch (MyApplicationException&amp; )&lt;/code&gt; will catch it too). This is why it is important to place the catch blocks of derived classes before the catch block of their super classes.}}

=== Exception specifications ===
{{NOTE|The use of exception specifications has been deprecated in the new standard C++11. It is recommended that nobody use them. They are included here for historical reasons(not everybody is using C++11 yet)}}
The range of exceptions that can be thrown by a function are an important part of that function's public interface. Without this information, you would have to assume that any exception could occur when calling any function, and consequently write code that was extremely defensive. Knowing the list of exceptions that can be thrown, you can simplify your code since it doesn't need to handle every case.

This exception information is specifically part of the ''public'' interface. Users of a class don't need to know anything about the way it is implemented, but they do need to know about the exceptions that can be thrown, just as they need to know the number and type of parameters to a member function. One way of providing this information to clients of a library is via code documentation, but this needs to be manually updated very carefully. Incorrect exception information is worse than none at all, since you may end up writing code that is less exception-safe than you intended to.

C++ provides another way of recording the exception interface, by means of ''exception specifications''. An exception specification is parsed by the compiler, which provides a measure of automated checking. An exception specification can be applied to any function, and looks like this:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
double divide(double dNumerator, double dDenominator) throw (DivideByZeroException);
&lt;/source&gt;

You can specify that a function cannot throw any exceptions by using an empty exception specification:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void safeFunction(int iFoo) throw();
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Shortcomings of exception specifications ====
C++ does not programmatically enforce exception specifications at compile time. For example, the following code is legal:

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
void DubiousFunction(int iFoo) throw()
{
    if (iFoo &lt; 0)
    {
        throw RangeException();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Rather than checking exception specifications at compile time, C++ checks them at run time, which means that you might not realize that you have an inaccurate exception specification until testing or, if you are unlucky, when the code is already in production.

If an exception is thrown at run time that propagates out of a function that doesn't allow the exception in its exception specification, the exception will not propagate any further and instead, the function &lt;code&gt;RangeException()&lt;/code&gt; will be called. The &lt;code&gt;RangeException()&lt;/code&gt; function doesn't return, but can throw a different type of exception that may (or may not) satisfy the exception specification and allow exception handling to carry on normally. If this still doesn't recover the situation, the program will be terminated.

Many people regard the behavior of attempting to translate exceptions at run time to be worse than simply allowing the exception to propagate up the stack to a caller who may be able to handle it. The fact that the exception specification has been violated does not mean that the caller ''can't'' handle the situation, only that the author of the code didn't expect it. Often there will be a &lt;code&gt;catch (...)&lt;/code&gt; block somewhere on the stack that can deal with ''any'' exception. 

{{NOTE|Some coding standards require that exception specifications are not used. In the C++ language standard C++11(C++0x), the use of exception specifications as specified in the current version of the standard (C++03), is deprecated. The use of exception specifications has been deprecated entirely, meaning that it is highly recommended that nobody use them.}}

=== Noexcept specifiers ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)==
RTTI refers to the ability of the system to report on the dynamic type of an object and to provide information about that type at runtime (as opposed to at compile time), and when utilized consistently can be a powerful tool to ease the work of the programmer in managing resources.

=== {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}} ===
Consider what you have already learned about the {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}} keyword, and let's say that we have the following class hierarchy:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
class Interface
{
public:
        virtual void GenericOp() = 0;// pure virtual function
};

class SpecificClass : public Interface
{
public:
        virtual void GenericOp();
        virtual void SpecificOp();
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's say that we also have a pointer of type &lt;code&gt;Interface*&lt;/code&gt;, like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
Interface* ptr_interface;
&lt;/source&gt;

Supposing that a situation emerges that we are forced to presume but have no guarantee that the pointer points to an object of type &lt;code&gt;SpecificClass&lt;/code&gt; and we would like to call the member &lt;code&gt;SpecificOp()&lt;/code&gt; of that class. To dynamically convert to a derived type we can use {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}}, like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
SpecificClass* ptr_specific = dynamic_cast&lt;SpecificClass*&gt;(ptr_interface);
if( ptr_specific ){
    // our suspicions are confirmed -- it really was a SpecificClass
    ptr_specific-&gt;SpecificOp();
}else{
    // our suspicions were incorrect -- it is definitely not a SpecificClass.
    // The ptr_interface points to an instance of some other child class of the base InterfaceClass.
    ptr_interface-&gt;GenericOp();
};
&lt;/source&gt;

With {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}}, the program converts the base class pointer to a derived class pointer and allows the derived class members to be called. Be very careful, however: if the pointer that you are trying to cast is not of the correct type, then {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}} will return a null pointer.

We can also use {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}} with references.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
SpecificClass&amp; ref_specific = dynamic_cast&lt;SpecificClass&amp;&gt;(ref_interface);
&lt;/source&gt;

This works almost in the same way as pointers. However, if the real type of the object being cast is not correct then {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}} will not return null (there's no such thing as a null reference). Instead, it will throw a &lt;code&gt;std::bad_cast&lt;/code&gt; exception.

=== {{C++ Programming/kw|typeid}} ===
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/typeid}}

In RTTI it is used in this setup:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
const std::type_info&amp; info = typeid(object_expression);
&lt;/source&gt;

Sometimes we need to know the exact type of an object. The &lt;code&gt;typeid&lt;/code&gt; operator returns a reference to a standard class &lt;code&gt;std::type_info&lt;/code&gt; that contains information about the type. This class provides some useful members including the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; operators. The most interesting method is probably:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
const char* std::type_info::name() const;
&lt;/source&gt;

This member function returns a pointer to a C-style string with the name of the object type. For example, using the classes from our earlier example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
const std::type_info &amp;info = typeid(*ptr_interface);
std::cout &lt;&lt; info.name() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

This program would print something like&lt;ref&gt;
(The exact string returned by std::type_info::name() is compiler-dependent).
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;code&gt;SpecificClass&lt;/code&gt; because that is the dynamic type of the pointer &lt;code&gt;ptr_interface&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;code&gt;typeid&lt;/code&gt; is actually an operator rather than a function, as it can also act on types:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
const std::type_info&amp; info = typeid(type);
&lt;/source&gt;

for example (and somewhat circularly)

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
const std::type_info&amp; info = typeid(std::type_info);
&lt;/source&gt;

will give a &lt;code&gt;type_info&lt;/code&gt; object which describes &lt;code&gt;type_info&lt;/code&gt; objects.  This latter use is not RTTI, but rather CTTI (compile-time type identification).

===Limitations===
There are some limitations to RTTI. First, RTTI can only be used with ''polymorphic types''. That means that your classes must have at least one virtual function, either directly or through inheritance. Second, because of the additional information required to store types some compilers require a special switch to enable RTTI.

Note that references to pointers will not work under RTTI:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void example( int*&amp; refptrTest )
{
        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;What type is *&amp;refptrTest : &quot; &lt;&lt; typeid( refptrTest ).name() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Will report &lt;code&gt;int*&lt;/code&gt;, as &lt;code&gt;typeid()&lt;/code&gt; does not support reference types.

===Misuses of RTTI===
RTTI should only be used sparingly in C++ programs. There are several reasons for this. Most importantly, other language mechanisms such as polymorphism and templates are almost always superior to RTTI. As with everything, there are exceptions, but the usual rule concerning RTTI is more or less the same as with &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; statements. Do not use it as a shortcut around proper, more robust design.  Only use RTTI if you have a very good reason to do so and only use it if you know what you are doing.

{{Editor note|The following is only an outline, to be fleshed out.}}

==JavaScript Optimization==

===Optimization Techniques===
* High Level Optimization
** Algorithmic Optimization (Mathematical Analysis)
** Simplification

* Low Level Optimization
** Loop Unrolling
** Strength Reduction
** Duff's Device
** Clean Loops

* External Tools &amp; Libraries for speeding/optimizing/compressing JavaScript code

==Common Mistakes and Misconceptions==
===String concatenation===
Strings in JavaScript are immutable objects. This means that once you create a string object, to modify it, another string object must theoretically be created.

Now, suppose you want to perform a [[w:ROT-13|ROT-13]] on all the characters in a long string. Supposing you have a rot13() function, the obvious way to do this might be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
var s1 = &quot;the original string&quot;;
var s2 = &quot;&quot;;

for(i = 0; i &lt; s1.length; i++) {
  s2 += rot13(s1.charAt(i));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Especially in older browsers like Internet Explorer 6, this will be very slow. This is because, at each iteration, the entire string must be copied before the new letter is appended.

One way to make this script faster might be to create an array of characters, then join it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
var s1 = &quot;the original string&quot;;
var a2 = new Array(s1.length);
var s2 = &quot;&quot;;

for(i = 0; i &lt; s1.length; i++) {
  a2[i] = rot13(s1.charAt(i));
}
s2 = a2.join('');
&lt;/source&gt;

Internet Explorer 6 will run this code faster. However, since the original code is so obvious and easy to write, most modern browsers have improved the handling of such concatenations. On some browsers the original code may be faster than this code.

A second way to improve the speed of this code is to break up the string being written to. For instance, if this is normal text, a space might make a good separator:

&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
var s1 = &quot;the original string&quot;;
var c;
var st = &quot;&quot;;
var s2 = &quot;&quot;;

for(i = 0; i &lt; s1.length; i++) {
  c = rot13(s1.charAt(i));
  st += c;
  if(c == &quot; &quot;) {
    s2 += st;
    st = &quot;&quot;;
  }
}
s2 += st;
&lt;/source&gt;

This way the bulk of the new string is copied much less often, because individual characters are added to a smaller temporary string.

A third way to really improve the speed in a for loop, is to move the [array].length statement outside the condition statement. In face, every occurrence, the [array].length will be re-calculate
For a two occurences loop, the result will not be visible, but (for example) in a five thousand occurence loop, you'll see the difference.
It can be explained with a simple calculation :
&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
// we assume that myArray.length is 5000
for(x = 0;x &lt; myArray.length;x++){
// doing some stuff
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&quot;x = 0&quot; is evaluated only one time, so it's only one operation.

&quot;x &lt; myArray.length&quot; is evaluated 5000 times, so it is 10,000 operations (&lt;code&gt;myArray.length&lt;/code&gt; is an operation and compare &lt;code&gt;myArray.length&lt;/code&gt; with x, is another operation).

&quot;x++&quot; is evaluated 5000 times, so it's 5000 operations.

There is a total of 15 001 operation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
// we assume that myArray.length is 5000
for(x = 0, l = myArray.length; x &lt; l; x++){
// doing some stuff
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&quot;x = 0&quot; is evaluated only one time, so it's only one operation.

&quot;l = myArray.length&quot; is evaluated only one time, so it's only one operation.

&quot;x &lt; l&quot; is evaluated 5000 times, so it is 5000 operations (l with x, is one operation).

&quot;x++&quot; is evaluated 5000 times, so it's 5000 operations.

There is a total of 10002 operation.

So, in order to optimize your for loop, you need to make code like this :
&lt;source lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
var s1 = &quot;the original string&quot;;
var c;
var st = &quot;&quot;;
var s2 = &quot;&quot;;

for(i = 0, l = s1.length; i &lt; l; i++) {
  c = rot13(s1.charAt(i));
  st += c;
  if(c == &quot; &quot;) {
    s2 += st;
    st = &quot;&quot;;
  }
}
s2 += st;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Templates ==
Templates are a way to make code more reusable. Trivial examples include creating generic data structures which can store arbitrary data types. Templates are of great utility to programmers, especially when combined with multiple [[w:Inheritance in object-oriented programming|inheritance]] and [[w:operator overloading|operator overloading]]. The [[C++ Programming/STL|Standard Template Library]] (STL) provides many useful functions within a framework of connected templates.

As templates are very expressive they may be used for things other than generic programming.  One such use is called [[w:template metaprogramming|template metaprogramming]], which is a way of pre-evaluating some of the code at compile-time rather than run-time.  Further discussion here only relates to templates as a method of generic programming.

By now you should have noticed that functions that perform the same tasks tend to look similar. For example, if you wrote a function that prints an int, you would have to have the int declared first. This way, the possibility of error in your code is reduced, however, it gets somewhat annoying to have to create different versions of functions just to handle all the different data types you use. For example, you may want the function to simply print the input variable, regardless of what type that variable is. Writing a different function for every possible input type (&lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;char *&lt;/tt&gt;, etc. ...) would be extremely cumbersome. That is where templates come in.

Templates solve some of the same problems as macros, generate &quot;optimized&quot; code at compile time, but are subject to C++'s strict type checking.

Parameterized types, better known as templates, allow the programmer to create one function that can handle many different types. Instead of having to take into account every data type, you have one arbitrary parameter name that the compiler then replaces with the different data types that you wish the function to use, manipulate, etc.

*Templates are instantiated at compile-time with the source code. 
*Templates are type safe. 
*Templates allow user-defined specialization. 
*Templates allow non-type parameters. 
*Templates use “lazy structural constraints”. 
*Templates support mix-ins. 

; Syntax for Templates :
Templates are pretty easy to use, just look at the syntax:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 template &lt;class TYPEPARAMETER&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

(or, equivalently, and preferred by some)

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 template &lt;typename TYPEPARAMETER&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Function template ===
There are two kinds of templates.  A ''function template'' behaves like a function that can accept arguments of many different types.  For example, the Standard Template Library contains the function template &lt;tt&gt;max(x, y)&lt;/tt&gt; which returns either &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt;, whichever is larger.  &lt;tt&gt;max()&lt;/tt&gt; could be defined like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    template &lt;typename TYPEPARAMETER&gt;
    TYPEPARAMETER max(TYPEPARAMETER x, TYPEPARAMETER y)
    {
        if (x &lt; y)
            return y;
        else
            return x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

This template can be called just like a function:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; max(3, 7);   // outputs 7
&lt;/source&gt;

The compiler determines by examining the arguments that this is a call to &lt;tt&gt;max(int, int)&lt;/tt&gt; and ''instantiates'' a version of the function where the type &lt;tt&gt;TYPEPARAMETER&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;.

This works whether the arguments &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; are integers, strings, or any other type for which it makes sense to say &quot;&lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. If you have defined your own data type, you can use operator overloading to define the meaning of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; for your type, thus allowing you to use the &lt;tt&gt;max()&lt;/tt&gt; function. While this may seem a minor benefit in this isolated example, in the context of a comprehensive library like the STL it allows the programmer to get extensive functionality for a new data type, just by defining a few operators for it.  Merely defining &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt; allows a type to be used with the standard &lt;tt&gt;sort()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;stable_sort()&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;binary_search()&lt;/tt&gt; algorithms; data structures such as &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt;s, heaps, and associative arrays; and more.

As a counterexample, the standard type &lt;tt&gt;complex&lt;/tt&gt; does not define the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt; operator, because there is no strict order on [[w:complex number|complex number]]s.  Therefore &lt;code&gt;max(x, y)&lt;/code&gt; will fail with a compile error if ''x'' and ''y'' are &lt;tt&gt;complex&lt;/tt&gt; values.  Likewise, other templates that rely on &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt; cannot be applied to &lt;tt&gt;complex&lt;/tt&gt; data.  Unfortunately, compilers historically generate somewhat esoteric and unhelpful error messages for this sort of error. Ensuring that a certain object adheres to a [[w:protocol (computer science)|method protocol]] can alleviate this issue.

&lt;tt&gt;{TYPEPARAMETER}&lt;/tt&gt; is just the arbitrary '''TYPEPARAMETER''' name that you want to use in your function. Some programmers prefer using just &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; in place of &lt;tt&gt;TYPEPARAMETER&lt;/tt&gt;.

Let us say you want to create a swap function that can handle more than one data type... something that looks like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 template &lt;class SOMETYPE&gt; 
 void swap (SOMETYPE &amp;x, SOMETYPE &amp;y) 
 { 
   SOMETYPE temp = x; 
   x = y; 
   y = temp; 
 } 
&lt;/source&gt;

The function you see above looks really similar to any other swap function, with the differences being the template &lt;class SOMETYPE&gt; line before the function definition and the instances of SOMETYPE in the code. Everywhere you would normally need to have the name or class of the datatype that you're using, you now replace with the arbitrary name that you used in the template &lt;class SOMETYPE&gt;. For example, if you had '''SUPERDUPERTYPE''' instead of '''SOMETYPE''', the code would look something like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 template &lt;class SUPERDUPERTYPE&gt; 
 void swap (SUPERDUPERTYPE &amp;x, SUPERDUPERTYPE &amp;y) 
 { 
   SUPERDUPERTYPE temp = x; 
   x = y; 
   y = temp; 
 } 
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, you can use whatever label you wish for the template '''TYPEPARAMETER''', as long as it is not a reserved word.

=== Class template ===
A ''class template'' extends the same concept to classes.  Class templates are often used to make generic containers. For example, the STL has a [[w:linked list|linked list]] container. To make a linked list of integers, one writes &lt;tt&gt;list&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. A list of strings is denoted &lt;tt&gt;list&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. A &lt;tt&gt;list&lt;/tt&gt; has a set of standard functions associated with it, which work no matter what you put between the brackets.

If you want to have more than one template '''TYPEPARAMETER''', then the syntax would be:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 template &lt;class SOMETYPE1, class SOMETYPE2, ...&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

;Templates and Classes
Let us say that rather than create a simple templated function, you would like to use templates for a class, so that the class may handle more than one datatype. You may have noticed that some classes are able to accept a type as a parameter and create variations of an object based on that type (for example the classes of the STL container class hierarchy). This is because they are declared as templates using syntax not unlike the one presented below:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 template &lt;class T&gt; class Foo
 {
 public:
   Foo();
   void some_function();
   T some_other_function();

 private:
   int member_variable;
   T parametrized_variable;
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

Defining member functions of a template class is somewhat like defining a function template, except for the fact, that you use the scope resolution operator to indicate that this is the template classes' member function. The one important and non-obvious detail is the requirement of using the template operator containing the parametrized type name after the class name.

The following example describes the required syntax by defining functions from the example class above.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 template &lt;class T&gt; Foo&lt;T&gt;::Foo()
 {
   member_variable = 0;
 }

 template &lt;class T&gt; void Foo&lt;T&gt;::some_function()
 {
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;member_variable = &quot; &lt;&lt; member_variable &lt;&lt; endl;
 }

 template &lt;class T&gt; T Foo&lt;T&gt;::some_other_function()
 {
   return parametrized_variable;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

As you may have noticed, if you want to declare a function that will return an object of the parametrized type, you just have to use the name of that parameter as the function's return type.

{{NOTE|A class template can be used to avoid the overhead of virtual member functions in inheritance. Since the type of class is known at compile-time, the class template will not need the virtual pointer table that is required by a class with virtual member functions. This distinction also permits the inlining of the function members of a class template.}}

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
Some uses of templates, such as the &lt;tt&gt;max()&lt;/tt&gt; function, were previously filled by function-like [[w:preprocessor|preprocessor]] [[w:macro|macro]]s.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// a max() macro
#define max(a,b)   ((a) &lt; (b) ? (b) : (a))
&lt;/source&gt;

Both macros and templates are expanded at compile time.  Macros are always expanded inline; templates can also be expanded as inline functions when the compiler deems it appropriate.  Thus both function-like macros and function templates have no run-time overhead.

However, templates are generally considered an improvement over macros for these purposes.  Templates are type-safe.  Templates avoid some of the common errors found in code that makes heavy use of function-like macros.  Perhaps most importantly, templates were designed to be applicable to much larger problems than macros.  The definition of a function-like macro must fit on a single logical line of code.

There are three primary drawbacks to the use of templates.  First, many compilers historically have very poor support for templates, so the use of templates can make code somewhat less portable.  Second, almost all compilers produce confusing, unhelpful error messages when errors are detected in template code.  This can make templates difficult to develop.  Third, each use of a template may cause the compiler to generate extra code (an ''instantiation'' of the template), so the indiscriminate use of templates can lead to [[w:code bloat|code bloat]], resulting in excessively large executables.

The other big disadvantage of templates is that to replace a #define like max which acts identically with dissimilar types or function calls is impossible. Templates have replaced using #defines for complex functions but not for simple stuff like max(a,b). For a full discussion on trying to create a template for the #define max, see the paper [http://www.aristeia.com/Papers/C%2B%2BReportColumns/jan95.pdf &quot;Min, Max and More&quot;] that Scott Meyer wrote for ''C++ Report'' in January 1995.

The biggest advantage of using templates, is that a complex algorithm can have a simple interface that the compiler then uses to choose the correct implementation based on the type of the arguments. For instance, a searching algorithm can take advantage of the properties of the container being searched. This technique is used throughout the C++ standard library.

=== Linkage problems ===
While linking a template-based program consisting over several modules spread over a couple files, it is a frequent and mystifying situation to find that the object code of the modules won't link due to 'unresolved reference to (insert template member function name here) in (...)'. The offending function's implementation is there, so why is it missing from the object code? Let us stop a moment and consider how can this be possible.

Assume you have created a template based class called Foo and put its declaration in the file Util.hpp along with some other regular class called Bar:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 template &lt;class T&gt; Foo
 {
 public: 
   Foo();
   T some_function();
   T some_other_function();
   T some_yet_other_function();
   T member;
 };

 class Bar
 {
   Bar();
   void do_something();
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, to adhere to all the rules of the art, you create a file called Util.cc, where you put all
the function definitions, template or otherwise:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #include &quot;Util.hpp&quot;

 template &lt;class T&gt; T Foo&lt;T&gt;::some_function()
 {
  ...
 }

 template &lt;class T&gt; T Foo&lt;T&gt;::some_other_function()
 {
  ...
 }

 template &lt;class T&gt; T Foo&lt;T&gt;::some_yet_other_function()
 {
  ...
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

and, finally:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 void Bar::do_something()
 {
   Foo&lt;int&gt; my_foo;
   int x = my_foo.some_function();
   int y = my_foo.some_other_function();
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Next, you compile the module, there are no errors, you are happy. But suppose there is an another 
(main) module in the program, which resides in MyProg.cc:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #include &quot;Util.hpp&quot;	// imports our utility classes' declarations, including the template

 int main()
 {
   Foo&lt;int&gt; main_foo;
   int z = main_foo.some_yet_other_function();
   return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This also compiles clean to the object code. Yet when you try to link the two modules together, you get an error saying there is an undefined reference to Foo&lt;int&gt;::some_yet_other function() in
MyProg.cc. You defined the template member function correctly, so what is the problem?

As you remember, templates are instantiated at compile-time. This helps avoid code bloat,
which would be the result of generating all the template class and function variants for all
possible types as its parameters. So, when the compiler processed the Util.cc code, it saw that
the only variant of the Foo class was Foo&lt;int&gt;, and the only needed functions were: 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 int Foo&lt;int&gt;::some_function();
 int Foo&lt;int&gt;::some_other_function();
&lt;/source&gt;

No code in Util.cc required any other variants of Foo or its methods to exist, so the compiler
generated no code other than that. There is no implementation of some_yet_other_function() in the object code, just as there is no implementation for

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 double Foo&lt;double&gt;::some_function();
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 string Foo&lt;string&gt;::some_function();
&lt;/source&gt;

The MyProg.cc code compiled without errors, because the member function of Foo it uses is correctly declared in the Util.hpp header, and it is expected that it will be available upon linking. But it is not and hence the error, and a lot of nuisance if you are new to templates
and start looking for errors in your code, which ironically is perfectly correct.

The solution is somewhat compiler dependent. For the GNU compiler, try experimenting with the -frepo flag, and also reading the template-related section of 'info gcc' (node &quot;Template Instantiation&quot;: &quot;Where is the Template?&quot;) may prove enlightening. In Borland, supposedly, there is a selection in the linker options, which activates 'smart' templates just for this kind of problem.

The other thing you may try is called explicit instantiation. What you do is create some dummy code
in the module with the templates, which creates all variants of the template class and calls all
variants of its member functions, which you know are needed elsewhere. Obviously, this requires you to know a lot about what variants you need throughout your code. In our simple example this would go like this:

1. Add the following class declaration to Util.hpp:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 class Instantiations
 {
 private:
   void Instantiate();
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

2. Add the following member function definition to Util.cc:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 void Instantiations::Instantiate()
 {
   Foo&lt;int&gt; my_foo;
   my_foo.some_yet_other_function();
   // other explicit instantiations may follow
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, you never need to actually instantiate the Instantiations class, or call any of its methods. The fact that they just exist in the code makes the compiler generate all the template variations which are required. Now the object code will link without problems.

There is still one, if not elegant, solution. Just move all the template functions' definition code to the Util.hpp header file. This is not pretty, because header files are for declarations, and the implementation is supposed to be defined elsewhere, but it does the trick in this situation. 
While compiling the MyProg.cc (and any other modules which include Util.hpp) code, the compiler will generate all the template variants which are needed, because the definitions are readily available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Libraries ==
Libraries allow existing code to be reused in a program. Libraries are like programs except that instead of relying on '''main()''' to do the work you call the specific functions provided by the library to do the work. Functions provide the interface between the program being written and the library being used. This interface is called [[w:Application programming interface|''Application Programming Interface'']] or API.

Libraries should and tend to be domain specific as to permit greater mobility across applications, and provide extended specialization.
Libraries that are not, are often header only distribution, intended for static linking as to permit the compiler and the application, only to use the needed bits of code.

{{:C++ Programming/Code/API}}

As seen in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/File Organization|File organization Section]], compiled libraries consists in C++ headers files that are included by the preprocessor and binary library files which are used by the linker to generate the resulting compilation. For a dynamically linked library, only the loading code is added to the compilation that uses them, the actual loading of the library is done in the memory at run-time.

Programs can make use of libraries in two forms, as static or dynamic depending on how the programmer decides to distribute its code or even due to the licensing used by third party libraries, the [[C++ Programming/Compiler/Linker/Libraries/Static and Dynamic Libraries|static and dynamic libraries]] section of this book will cover in depth this subject.

{{NOTE|As we will see when covering [[C++ Programming/Threading|multi-threading]] when selecting libraries. Remember to verify if they conform to the your requirements on that area.}} 

=== Third party libraries ===
Additional functionality that goes beyond the standard libraries (like [[C++ Programming/Compiler/Linker/Libraries/Garbage Collection|garbage collection]]) are available (often free) by third party libraries, but remember that third party libraries do not necessarily provide the same ubiquitous cross-platform functionality or an API style conformant with as standard libraries. The main motivation for their existence is for preventing one tho reinvent the wheel and to make efforts converge; too much energy has been spent by generations of programmers to write safe and &quot;portable&quot; code.

There are several libraries a programmer is expected to know about or have at least a passing idea of what they are. Time, consistency and extended references will make a few libraries pop-out from the rest. One notable example is the highly respected collection of [[C++ Programming/Libraries/Boost|Boost libraries]] that we will examine ahead.

;Licensing on third party libraries
The programmer may also be limited by the requirements of the license used on external libraries that he has no direct control, for instance the use of the [[w:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]] (GNU GPL) code in closed source applications isn't permitted to address this issue the FSF provides an alternative in the form of the GNU LGPL license that permits such uses but only in the  dynamically linked form, this is mirrored by several other legal requirements a programmer must attend and comply to.

Libraries come in two forms, either in ''source form'' or in ''compiled/binary form''. Libraries in source-form must first be compiled before they can be included in another project. This will transform the libraries' cpp-files into a lib-file. If a program must be recompiled to run with a new version of a library, but does not need any further changes, the library is said to be ''source compatible''. If a program does not need to be modified and recompiled to use a new version of a library, the library is then classified as being ''binary compatible''.

{{:C++ Programming/Compiler/Linker/Libraries/Static and Dynamic Libraries}}

;header-only libraries
Another distinction that is commonly made about libraries are on how they are distributed (regarding structure and use). A library that is contained only on header files is considered header-only library. Often this means that they are simpler and easy to use, however this will not be the ideal solution for complex code, it will not only hamper readability but result in larger compile times. Also depending on the compiler and it's optimizing capabilities (or options) can, due to the resulting inlining, generate larger binaries. This may not be as important in libraries mostly implemented with templates. Header-only libraries will always contain the source code to the implementation, commercial is rare.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is An Argument?==

When you hear the word &quot;argument,&quot; what do you think of?  Maybe you think of a shouting match or a fist fight?  Well, when instructors use the word &quot;argument,&quot; they're typically thinking about something else. What they're actually referring to is a a position supported by the analysis that preceded its conception, not necessarily defending against antagonism.  

More to the point, they're talking about defending a certain point of view through writing or speech. Usually called a &quot;claim&quot; or a &quot;thesis,&quot; this point of view is concerned with an issue that doesn't have a clear right or wrong answer (e.g., four and two make six).  Also, this argument should not only be concerned with personal opinion (e.g., I really like carrots). Instead, an argument might tackle issues like abortion, capital punishment, stem cell research, or gun control. However, what distinguishes an argument from a descriptive essay or &quot;report&quot; is that '''the argument must take a stance'''; if you're merely summarizing &quot;both sides&quot; of an issue or pointing out the &quot;pros and cons,&quot; you're not really writing an argument. &quot;Stricter gun control laws will likely result in a decrease in gun-related violence&quot; is an argument. Note that people can and will disagree with this argument, which is precisely why so many instructors find this type of assignment so useful -- they make you think!

Academic arguments usually &quot;articulate an opinion.&quot;  This opinion is always carefully '''defended with good reasoning and supported by plenty of research'''. Research?  Yes, research!  Indeed, part of learning to write effective arguments is finding reliable sources(or other documents) that lend credibility to your position. It's not enough to say &quot;capital punishment is wrong because that's the way I feel.&quot; 


Instead, you need to adequately support your claim by finding:
*facts
*statistics
*quotations from recognized authorities, and
*other types of evidence 

You won't always win, and that's fine. The goal of an argument is simply to:

*make a claim 
*support your claim with the most credible reasoning and evidence you can muster 
*hope that the reader will at least understand your position 
*hope that your claim is taken seriously 

If you defend your argument's position with good reasoning and evidence, you should earn a high grade, even if your instructor personally disagrees with the views you are defending.


We will be covering the basic format of how to structure an argument.  This includes the '''general written argument''' structure, and the '''Position''' and '''Proposal''' variations of that basic form. If you want to make a claim about a particular (usually controversial) issue, you can use the Position argument form. Alternately, if you would like to offer a solution to a particular situation that you see as problematic, such as the rising cost of education, you can get your idea across using a Proposal argument. By adapting one of these three methods, you will be well on the way to making your point.  The great thing about the argument structure is its amazingly versatility.  Once you become familiar with this basic structure of the argumentative essay, you will be able to clearly argue about almost anything! 

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=&quot;If you can't annoy somebody, there's little point in writing.&quot;|caption=--Kingsley Amis (1922 - 1995)}}

==Basic Argument Essay Structure== 

===Introduction===
The first paragraph of your argument is used to '''introduce your topic''' and the issues surrounding it.  This needs to be in clear, easily understandable language. Your readers need to know what you're writing about before they can decide if they believe you or not.   

Once you have introduced your general subject, it's time to '''state your claim'''.  Your claim will serve as the thesis for your essay.  Make sure that you use clear and precise language. Your reader needs to understand exactly where you stand on the issue.  The clarity of your claim affects your readers' understanding of your views.  Also, it's a good idea to highlight what you plan to cover.  Highlights allow your reader to know what direction you will be taking with your argument.

You can also mention the points or arguments in support of your claim, which you will be further discussing in the body. This part comes at the end of the thesis and can be named as ''the guide''. The guide is a useful tool for you as well as the readers. It is useful for you, because this way you will be more organized.  In addition, your audience will have a clear cut idea as to what will be discussed in the body.

==Body==

===Background Information===

Once your position is stated you should '''establish your credibility'''.  There are two sides to every argument.  This means not everyone will agree with your viewpoint.  So try to '''form a common ground''' with the audience.  Think about who may be undecided or opposed to your viewpoint.  Take the audience's age, education, values, gender, culture, ethnicity, and all other variables into consideration as you introduce your topic.  These variables will affect your word choice, and your audience may be more likely to listen to your argument with an open mind if you do.

===Developing Your Argument===

Back up your thesis with logical and persuasive arguments.  During your pre-writing phase, outline the main points you might use to support your claim, and decide which are the strongest and most logical. Eliminate those which are based on emotion rather than fact. Your corroborating evidence should be well-researched, such as statistics, examples, and expert opinions. You can also reference personal experience. It's a good idea to have a mixture. However, you should avoid leaning too heavily on personal experience, as you want to present an argument that appears objective as you are using it to persuade your reader. 

There are a couple different methods of developing your argument.  Two variations of the ''basic argument structure'' are the '''Position Method''' and the '''Proposal Method'''.  

====Position Method====

The '''Position Method''' is used to try to convince your audience that you are ''in the right'', and the other view of your argument is ''wrong''.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
# '''Introduce and define your topic.'''  Never assume that your reader is familiar with the issues surrounding your topic. This is your chance to set up the premise (point of view) you want to use. This is also a good time to '''present your thesis statement'''.
# '''Background information.'''  '''Do your research'''! The more knowledgeable you are, the more concise an argument you will be able to give.  You will now be able to provide your reader with the best information possible.  This will allow your audience to read your paper with the same knowledge you possess on the topic.  Information is the backbone to a solid argument.
# '''Development.'''  You have your argument, and you may have even stated your thesis.  Now, start developing your ideas.  Provide evidence and reasoning.
# '''Be prepared to deal with the &quot;Other Side.&quot;'''  There will be those who oppose your argument.  Be prepared to answer those opinions or points of view with knowledgeable responses.  If you have done your homework and know your material, you will be able to address any opposing arguments with ease and authority.
# '''In conclusion...'''  Now is the time to drive home your point.  Re-emphasize your main arguments and thesis statement.
|caption=Position Method}}

====Proposal Method====

The '''Proposal Method''' of argument is used when there is a problematic situation, and you would like to offer a solution to the situation.  The structure of the Proposal method is very similar to the above Position method, but there are slight differences.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
# '''Introduce and define the nature of the problematic situation.'''  Make sure to focus on the actual problem and what is causing the problem.  This may seem simple, but many people focus solely on the effects of a problematic situation.  By focusing on the actual problem, your readers will see your proposal as a solution to the problem.  If you don't, your readers might see your solution as a mere complaint.
# '''Propose a solution, or a number of solutions, to the problem.''' Be specific about these solutions. If you have one solution, you may choose to break it into parts and spend a paragraph or so describing each part. If you have several solutions, you may instead choose to spend a paragraph on each scenario.  Each additional solution will add both depth and length to your argument.  But remember to stay focused.  Added length does not always equal a better argument.
# '''Describe the workability of the various solutions.''' There are a variety of ways that this could be done. With a single-solution paper you could break the feasibility down into short and long term goals and plans. With a multiple-solution essay, you may instead highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the individual solutions, and establish which would be the most successful, based on your original statement of the problem and its causes. 
# '''Summarize and conclude your proposal.''' Summarize your solutions, re-state how the solution or solutions would work to remedy the problematic situation, and you're done.
|caption=Proposal Method}}

===Dealing With the Opposition===

When writing an argument, expect that you will have opposition. Skeptical readers will have their own beliefs and points of view.  When conducting your research, make sure to review the opposing side of the argument that you are presenting.  You need to be prepared to counter those ideas.  Remember, in order for people to give up their position, they must see how your position is more reasonable than their own. When you address the opposing point of view in your essay and demonstrate how your own claim is stronger, you neutralize their argument. By failing to address a non-coinciding view, you leave a reason for your reader to disagree with you, and therefore weaken your persuasive power. Methods of addressing the opposing side of the argument vary. You may choose to state your main points, then address and refute the opposition, and then conclude.  Conversely, you might summarize the opposition's views early in your argument, and then revisit them after you've presented your side or the argument.  This will show how your information is more reasonable than their own.

==Conclusion==
You have introduced your topic, stated your claim, supported that claim with logical and reasonable evidence, and refuted your opposition's viewpoint. The hard work is done. Now it's time to wrap things up. By the time readers get to the end of your paper, they should have learned something.  You should have learned something, too.  Give readers an idea to take away with them.  Conclude = to come together or to end (not restate what has already been said in your paper). One word of caution: avoid introducing any new information in your conclusion. If you find that there's another point that you wanted to include, revise your essay.  Include this new information into the body of your essay.  The conclusion should only review what the rest of your essay has offered.

==Strengthening Your Argument==

===Phrasing===

It is important to clearly state and support your position.  However, it is just as important to present all of the information that you've gathered in an objective manner. Using language that is demeaning or non-objective will undermine the strength of your argument. This destroys your credibility and will reduce your audience on the spot. For example, a student writing an argument about why a particular football team has a good chance of &quot;going all the way&quot; is making a strategic error by stating that &quot;anyone who doesn't think that the Minnesota Vikings deserve to win the Super Bowl is a total idiot.&quot; Not only has the writer risked alienating any number of her readers, she has also made her argument seem shallow and poorly researched. In addition, she has committed a third mistake: making a sweeping generalization that cannot be supported.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=Use phrasing that does not:
*Alienate any part of your audience
*Make an argument that is poorly researched or shallow
*Make an unsupported generalization
|caption=Mistakes that could ruin your Argument}}

===Objective Language===
You should avoid using &quot;I&quot; and &quot;My&quot; (subjective) statements in your argument.  You should only use &quot;I&quot; or &quot;My&quot; if you are an expert in your field (on a given topic).  Instead choose more objective language to get your point across. Consider the following:

I believe that the United States Government is failing to meet the needs of today's average college student through the under-funding of need-based grants, increasingly restrictive financial aid eligibility requirements, and a lack of flexible student loan options.

&quot;Great,&quot; your reader thinks, &quot;Everyone's entitled to their opinion.&quot; 

Now lets look at this sentence again, but without the &quot;I&quot; at the beginning.  Does the same sentence becomes a strong statement of fact without your &quot;I&quot; tacked to the front?:

The United States Government is failing to meet the needs of today's average college student through the underfunding of need-based grants, increasingly restrictive financial aid eligibility requirements, and a lack of flexible student loan options.

&quot;Wow,&quot; your reader thinks, &quot;that really sounds like a problem.&quot; 

A small change like the removal of your &quot;I&quot;s and &quot;my&quot;s can make all the difference in how a reader perceives your argument-- as such, it's always good to proof read your rough draft and look for places where you could use objective rather than subjective language.

==Sample Essay==

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=

'''PGA Tour, Inc. v Casey Martin'''

Casey Martin was born with a degenerative circulatory disorder that makes his right leg very weak.   Casey Martin has shown that he possesses the ability to compete on the PGA tour.  He has confessed, “All I ever wanted was the chance to play and to see how good I could be” (Faces 1).  Yet it’s been written that “Walking not only causes him pain, fatigue, and anxiety, but also created a significant risk of hemorrhaging, developing blood clots, fracturing his tibia so badly an amputation might be required” (PGA Tour 9). This disorder prevents Martin from walking the golf course.  If he is unable to walk due to health reasons, his only option to find out just how good he actually is requires the use of a golf cart.  Yet the PGA has rules against the usage of golf carts. 

The PGA Tour has a rule saying players must walk the third and final stage of the golf tournament. While in Q School, a qualifying school for professional golfers, Martin submitted a request to be able to use a golf cart throughout the entire tournament. The PGA Tour denied his request. The PGA feels that walking is an integral part of the game, and being allowed to use a golf cart would give the individual an advantage over the rest of the field (Finchem 2). Subsequently, the PGA thought that if Martin used a golf cart it would fundamentally alter the nature of the tournament by giving him an unfair advantage.

Under the American’s with Disabilities Act, Martin filed a lawsuit which reads, “Prohibits discrimination on the basis of employment, state and local government, public accommodations, commercial facilities, transportation and telecommunications” (United States). Martin filed his suit specifically under Title III of the Act which requires public accommodations to make reasonable modifications for the disabled. The PGA Tour, a recreational facility and activity, is considered a public accommodation. Both the lower courts and the Supreme Court agreed with Martin. He had a right to use a motorized golf cart under the ADA because the PGA Tour is a public accommodation, and that it would not fundamentally alter the nature of the tournament.  The PGA Tour, Q School, and any “. . . golf courses, including play areas, are places of public accommodation during professional golf tournaments” (PGA Tour 2). Casey Martin was discriminated against because of his disability and because golf course are specifically identified as a public accommodation under Title III of the ADA.  

Originally Casey Martin was told by the PGA Tour that they would not accommodate his disability. The PGA feels that the playing field must be the same for every player, and allowing Martin to use a cart would give him an advantage over other players. The PGA argues that walking, and the loss of concentration due to fatigue, is part of the challenge of playing professional golf at its highest level (Finchem 2). The PGA also argues that using a golf cart would take out much of the physical conditioning factor of the sport. The PGA Tour claimed they were not required to allow Casey Martin to use a cart, but in the end it turns out that the PGA was required because the tournament is a public place.

As it is organized, “Any member of the public may enter the Q School by submitting two letters of recommendation and paying a $3,000 entry fee” (PGA Tour 1).  The golfers of the PGA pay to be a part of the PGA, therefore they are considered customers, and would make the PGA a public accommodation. The golfers pay for privileges such as Q School and to compete in the tournaments. Since Martin paid to play professional golf, and also paid his way through his qualifying school, he should not have been discriminated against while competing.  The Supreme Court ruled that Martin was a customer of competition when he practices his profession. Martin was a customer to this public accommodation, therefore the PGA Tour should be required to make reasonable modifications, and allow Casey Martin to use his golf cart.

Also, Casey Martin’s use of a golf cart would not “fundamentally alter” the core nature of the tournament. The PGA Tour argues, “While carts have become commonplace for recreational golf, walking had been an integral part of the tournament competition throughout the game’s history. Walking is a fundamental part of tournaments in championship competitions . . .” (Finchem 2). Yet the core nature of golf is aiming for the hole. “The use of carts is not inconsistent with the fundamental character of golf, the essence of which has always been shot-making. The walking rule contained in petitioner’s hard cards is neither an essential attribute of the game itself nor an indispensable feature of tournament golf” (PGA Tour 3).  This means that the game of golf is based on where the ball ends up and not on the endurance of walking. Yes golf is a game of strategy where one attempts to put the golf ball in the hole in the fewest strokes possible. But golf is not a mellow version of cross country running.  Nor is it based on how far you can walk. 

The golfers participating in the PGA Tour tournament do not need the walking stage of golf, because it is not essential to the game of golf. The PGA will argue that it is essential because of the endurance factor. However, walking the distance of the course is not part of the formal rules of golf (DREDF 2). It is the golfer’s choice to walk the course.  The PGA will argue that weather affects game play.  “Using a cart would be somewhat of an advantage all the time and could be a great advantage in many circumstances . . .rain delays . . .the temperature and the humidity are both in the nineties . . .” (Finchem 2).  In this case however, the variety of conditions the player would have to deal with would only matter if they were playing a multi-day tournament (DREDF 2). If a tournament is only one day in length, the fatigue factor of walking will generally be minimal compared to the other factors.

In the end, Casey Martin would be enduring enough pain as it is with his disorder.  The pain caused by his disorder can be compared to other golfers walking the final stage of the tournament. Martin’s disability causes him enough pain going from cart to shot that he would not have an advantage (DREDF 2). The PGA tour argues that it would indeed be unfair because other golfers would be walking, and that Casey Martin would have an advantage over everyone else walking the course. No matter what the PGA believes, the Supreme Court agrees with Martin, “. . . that even with the use of a cart, the fatigue Martin suffers from coping with his disability is greater than the fatigue his able-bodied competitors endure from walking the course” (PGA Tour). Even with the cart, Casey Martin must walk over a mile during an 18-hole round of golf. The combination of Casey Martin’s pain and the distance he will still walk would be enough that the other golfers would still have an advantage over him.

All Casey Martin ever wanted to do was to be the best he could possibly be. Does the PGA Tour have the right to shatter Casey Martin’s dreams because of a degenerative disorder?  In his own words Casey Martin says, “Without the ADA I never would have been able to pursue my dream of playing golf professionally” (Faces 1).  With a clarity the PGA should have began with, the Supreme Court agreed that Casey Martin did indeed have the right to pursue his dream.

==The Fallacies of Argument==

Okay; your paper is filled with quality research.  You're feeling good about your paper.  But when you get the paper back your instructor has left a comment like, &quot;This is an argument fallacy&quot;.  So now you're left wondering what is &quot;false&quot; about the argument; and what is this &quot;argument fallacy&quot;?  

Argumentative fallacies are sometimes called &quot;logical fallacies&quot;.  Usually these &quot;fallacies&quot; are created when the reasoning behind the argument lacks validity.  A lack of validity weakens your argument, and then leads to a failure to provide a sufficient claim.

Don't feel badly if your paper says &quot;fallacy of argument&quot; on it.  This is a common error in argumentative papers.  In fact, a detailed list of &quot;logical fallacies&quot; can be found in the &quot;Common Errors&quot; section of this book (just below &quot;Run-On&quot; sentences and &quot;Sentence Fragments&quot;.  If you would like to see the list of logical fallacies, please visit [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Logical_Fallacies The Writers Handbook].

&quot;Argumentative fallacy&quot; can be caused by your 'negligence' or lack of rigor and attention while making a certain argument. In other words, a very general argument, not followed through rigorously, can end up in something as an 'argumentative fallacy'. So, never generalize; don't just say and leave -- pursue your point to its logical termination.

==A Side Note==

Many topics that are written about in college are very controversial. When approaching a topic it is critical that you think about all of the implications that your argument makes. If, for example, you are writing a paper on abortion, you need to think about your audience. There will certainly be people in each of your classes that have some sort of relationship to this topic that may be different than yours. While you shouldn't let others' feelings sway your argument, you should approach each topic with a neutral mind and stay away from personal attacks. Keep your mind open to the implications of the opposition and formulate a logical stance considering the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_opposition binaries] equally. People may be offended by something you say, but if you have taken the time to think about the ideas that go into your paper, you should have no problem defending it.

== Old discussion ==
I may be confusing this with older chinese, but I remember some older japanese being written right to left occasionally.
:Hi. Wikipedia has an artile on it: [[w:Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts]], although I know almost nothing about right-to-left writing system... Actually, I was puzzled when I saw it for the first time (on old newspaper article or like). - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]]

Perhaps you're well aware of this matter and dared to put it, but just in case: 行かせられたくならなかった looks too strange (さすがに やりすぎ かな と). If the subject of the phrase is &quot;he&quot;, then either 行きたく(は)ならなかった or 行く気に(は)ならなかった is natural. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 04:14, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

Several pages were copied to this one and then marked for speedy deletion. As they had long histories, I merged them instead, and left the old pages up as redirects to this one.

==Mixed Usage section==
I was reading this section and it says &quot;は wa (topic marker) and です desu (is/am/are) are written in hiragana&quot;.  Although I am new to the Japanese language I believe that は is ha in hiragana.  Now it might be something that I haven't learned yet and am thus wrong, but I was hoping someone that knows the language might know enough to fix it if it's wrong. [[User:Phydend|Phydend]] 02:32, 8 April 2007 (UTC)
:Nevermind, I see that は is pronounced as &quot;wa&quot; when it is a topic marker. Ignore my post above. [[User:Phydend|Phydend]] 15:40, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
::Right! ;-) And you will see the same thing in: ''dewa'' (では), the particle ''e'' (へ) and the particle ''o'' (を). [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 12:33, 9 November 2007 (UTC)

==Grammar section==
&quot;Japanese is typically classified as an SOV (Subject Object Verb) language, whereas English is an SVO (Subject Verb Object) language.&quot;  It is true that Japanese is &lt;I&gt;typically classified&lt;/I&gt; as an SOV language, but that does not make it a true statement.  Japanese is in fact a &quot;V&quot; language.  The sentence structure for Japanese grammar relies on only one thing: its verb.  In written Japanese, a grammatically correct sentence ends with a verb; the order of the rest of the sentence - if it exists at all - is variable and mutable depending on the writer's preference.  It may change based on the writer's decision for emphasis.  When sentences do not stand alone, as is quite usually the case, the context of the sentence is often known in advance, and left out of the sentence entirely.  If we're already talking about cats, we will not say, ''&quot;Neko wa nezumi wo kuu.&quot;''  We will instead say ''&quot;Nezumi wo kuu.&quot;''  ''&quot;Neko wa&quot;'' is redundant and dismissed.  You could even ask &quot;What do cats do with mice?&quot;  In English, the answer might be, &quot;They eat them.&quot;  In Japanese, the answer would simply be &quot;Eat.&quot;  Verb only.

The section goes on to say that &quot;[as] long as you remember this grammar structure, Japanese won't be so difficult to learn.&quot;  It is more important, I think, to teach the new student that the sentence structure is even more simple and more flexible, and &lt;I&gt;that&lt;/I&gt; will help students most.  They will, inevitably, come across structure that defies SOV, and giving the true sentence structure will avoid confusion in the future.  [[User:Hekirou|Hekirou]] 15:01, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

:''&quot;[as] long as you remember this grammar structure, Japanese won't be so difficult to learn.&quot;'' Maybe this sentence should be removed. It's not up to us to decide what is difficult and what is not difficult to learn. That is for everybody personal. For a Korean, Japanese should be relatively easy to learn (since the grammatical structure is similar), but for a French it might be very difficult because of the numerous differences in grammatical structure, declinations (present, past, future tense, etc.), pronunciation, etc. Somebody who has been trying to learn it for a while but finds lots of difficulties and then read here that &quot;it's not so difficult to learn&quot; might find it frustrating and demoralizing. [[User:Shinjitsu|Shinjitsu]] 12:47, 9 November 2007 (UTC)

::As per above, I have removed the &quot;Japanese won't be difficult to learn&quot;, and replaced with the more neutral:
:::''Japanese grammar is markedly different from English grammar, but is very regular.''
::...as Japanese does present difficulties for English-speakers, but is regular.
::As per Hekirou's comment, I've emphasized the topic-prominent of Japanese, and the pro-drop, giving examples.
::[[User:Nbarth|Nbarth]] ([[User talk:Nbarth|talk]]) 00:04, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

== Gojūon table ==

:''The syllabary charts in Japanese are referred to as the 五十音 ''gojūon'', meaning &quot;fifty sounds&quot; because they are written in a five by ten chart. However, three of the fifty original sounds are duplicates, two are obsolete, and an extra one has been added, so that presently there are forty-six in common use.''

I'm pretty sure this explanation is incorrect or at least extremely unclear. I'm guessing it was originally worded unclearly by one editor and another editor incorrectly changed it to what they thought it meant. First off, in my understanding, the original gojūon table had 47 sounds. Kana for &quot;ye&quot;, &quot;yi&quot;, and &quot;wu&quot; never existed (although &quot;we&quot; and &quot;wi&quot; are sometimes romanized as &quot;ye&quot; and &quot;yi&quot;). The only two kana removed from the table were ゑ (we) and ゐ (wi). When you add ん (n'), you do end up with the 46 kana of modern Japanese. Both ゑ and ゐ were indeed &quot;duplicate&quot; sounds as they were actually pronounced &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;, so they were ''both'' duplicates and obsolete. を (wo) is also duplicate in sound (pronounced &quot;o&quot;), but not in function, so it was not removed and is still used in modern Japanese. So there were were indeed three duplicate sounds (we, wi, wo) and two obsolete kana (we, wi), but two of these duplicate sounds were the same as the obsolete kana and the remaining one was not removed. So the text appears to be claiming that there were originally 50 kana - 3 duplicates - 2 obsolete + 1 new = 46 kana, but in fact there were originally 47 kana - 2 obsolete + 1 new = 46 kana. So the above text is correct in saying that there are 46 kana in modern Japanese, but it is right for the wrong reason. :) I'm going to change the text myself to say there are a few gaps and leave it at that; why there are only 46 kana in a 5x10 table isn't that important anyway. - [[User:Furrykef|Furrykef]] ([[User talk:Furrykef|talk]]) 19:34, 22 December 2007 (UTC)

Sorry to bug again, but you mentioned having links in the TOC to all pages in the book. So far, I've only been able to have the TOC link to the subheadings on the first page.

Hello Whiteknight, Sorry for the late response.
Even I had been thinking about the Merge with the GRE book. But the thought we had was, we are going to cover information much more than just GRE, like TOEFL, application process, university selection process. 
Is it okay that we change the name of the book to something suitable at an later date?

Hello,

I am a 78 yearold former programmer/analyst and I find I have been passed by in the field of computers. When I pick up a book to read or for instruction in the new systems I am constantly trying to figure out what is meant by some of the abbreviations and acronyms they use. It gets very confusing.  Where can I get a book or list of these things as an aid to understanding what is written.

Thank you,

Hello, White Knight

I appreciate your comment that &quot;Concurrent Engineering&quot; is coming along nicely.

This is my first experience with 21st century wiki collaboration, and I have yet to learn all the navigation tools that come with.
Some of my students are keen and helpful, but not all.  The justifiable mantra of &quot;Do your own work, and earn your own grade!&quot; is hard to throw off in the name of cooperation.

Further advice from you will be appreciated

==Various==
The general layout of the book is in four sections. The first two are a historical review and a discussion of the problems thrown up by the empirical data. These have been merged but could be separated. The third is a presentation of neuroscience as it relates to consciousness and the fourth is about theories that attempt to explain consciousness.

There is a problem with the second section, &quot;the problems raised by the empirical data&quot;. In some ways this section could be called 'a hundred ways in which nineteenth century materialism fails to account for consciousness'. This will not be popular with a large caucus of philosophers but scientists need to see that the problem of consciousness, like all unresolved scientific problems, is about a failure of popular theory to account for the empirical data. Scientists must decide where theory fails to provide an elegant description of observation so that they can evolve new theories.

Functionalists and Eliminativists do not need a textbook about consciousness. A sentence will do stating that no-one should doubt that the universe is described by functional presentism hence consciousness can only be reflexive. But eliminativists and functionalists, on reflection, nearly always end up with 'non-reductivism' or 'emergentism' - there are things about consciousness that are not explained by the theory. Given this failure of the nineteenth century approach it is better to be 'up front' and describe &quot;the problems raised by the empirical data&quot; before assuming any theories.

The philosophical explanations of consciousness are hypotheses and need to go at the end of the book. The philosophers who are proponents of philosophical hypotheses may believe that they have argued their validity and hence elevate them above scientific hypotheses but this is largely a scientific textbook and philosophical blarney is no better than protoscience.

== free will ==

Is &quot;free will&quot; something that needs to be discussed in this book?
(see 
[http://naturalism.org/davies.htm Paul Davies' Really Dangerous Idea]
).
:Interesting article. The big problem is that type 2 &quot;freedom&quot; is deterministic except for chaotic events and these are not &quot;willed&quot;. It is doubtful whether type 2 free will  qualifies as free will at all according to the intuitions of free will held by ordinary people. The type 2 free will component of a book on consciousness studies would be a module in the access consciousness section. The type 1 free will component would depend upon speculations about the physical nature of phenomenal consciousness. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:03, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

==New comments go at the bottom==

This book has been hjacked by cranks and people who don't really know what they are talking about. It needs to be peer reviewed. 

:The section on the neuroscience of vision is straighforward textbook physiology. As are many of the other sections, including those on philosophy. It is natural for anyone committed to the mid to late twentieth century idea that consciousness is entirely access consciousness to consider the treatment of phenomenal consciousness to be &quot;cranky&quot;. Please could you be specific about your problem? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:38, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

==Audition==

I'd love to see a section in part III on the neuroscience of hearing. I know a little about it and there are many interesting auditory anomalies/illusions that could shed some light on this important aspect of consciousness. Music and it's affects, it's role as perhaps &quot;higher&quot; language may prove interesting here also. I'm also certainly not knowledgeable enough to initiate such a section. I'm fairly new to Wikipedia so I hope I've not stepped on any toes. [[User:203.52.129.250|203.52.129.250]]
::I concur, as it is so hard to find credible scientific peer reviewed articles oni the net about subject as the neural correlate of music, and of the perception of music by dogs, alternatives harmonies and such. maybe this book can over it.

Is that really consciousness? It seems like that doesn't fit under the topic. Please explain. I guess if you are talking about hearing only, it fits fine, but if it becomes very music-specific, I think it would better fit under music theory, or something like that. I like the idea though.

==Link to consciousness survey project at canonizer.com?==

The [http://canonizer.com/topic.asp/105 consciousness survey project] has as its goal a comprehensive concise and quantitative survey of what are the most well accepted theories of consciousness.  Would it be OK to add a link to this, perhaps in the history section of this page, since this is a real time survey, including now more than 2 years of history of a kind of a consensus horse race that is obviously just getting started?  The more people that participate in the survey process (canonize their views, if you will) the more comprehensive it becomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This section is about the types of theory that have been advanced to explain consciousness. Specific explanations should be entered as separate pages.''

==Introduction==

Explanations of consciousness fall into three broad categories, those that attempt to explain the empirical experience called consciousness with scientific theories, those that seek to find some way in which consciousness could be explained by digital computers or nineteenth century materialism by redefining or eliminating experience and those that regard consciousness as inexplicable or supernatural.
&lt;!-- section on magic cut - see discussion --&gt;

==Identity theory of mind==

The identity theory of mind, or type physicalism, holds that the mind is identical to the brain. Type physicalists identify qualia and the form of experience with brain activity. They argue that &quot;mind states&quot; have physical causes and physical effects - thus the mind states themselves must be physical; a non-physical &quot;middle step&quot; is superfluous.

Type physicalism has not yet gained widespread support because although brain activity that correlates with experience has been found everywhere in the brain, no set of brain activity that is phenomenal consciousness itself has yet been found - although this is not surprising because neuronal spike activity is unlikely to host phenomenal consciousness - see [[Consciousness Studies/Table Of Theories|scientific theories of consciousness]].

==Functionalism==

Functionalism was developed as a theory of the mind-body problem because of objections to identity theory and logical behaviourism. Its core idea is that the mental states can be accounted for without taking into account the underlying physical medium (the neurons), instead attending to higher-level functions such as beliefs, desires, and emotions. It is a theory of behaviour and access consciousness and so from the outset avoids any explanation of phenomenal consciousness, substituting beliefs and judgements (functions) for entities such as qualia.

According to functionalism, the mental states that make up consciousness can essentially be defined as complex interactions between different functional processes. Because these processes are not limited to a particular physical state or physical medium, they can be realized in multiple ways, including, theoretically, within non-biological systems.This affords consciousness the opportunity to exist in non-human minds that are based on algorithmic processors such as digital computers. This is a highly contentious conjecture although non-functionalist physicalists might agree that machines that are not digital computers could possess consciousness through an identity theory of mind - see [[Consciousness Studies/The Philosophical Problem/Machine Consciousness#The problem of machine and digital consciousness|The problem of machine and digital consciousness]]. 

Functionalism's explanation of consciousness, or the mental, is best understood when considering the analogy made by functionalists between the mind and the modern digital computer. More specifically, the analogy is made to a &quot;machine&quot; capable of computing any given algorithm (i.e. a Turing machine). This machine would involve:

Data input (the senses in humans), 
data output (both behaviour and memory), 
functional states (mental states),
the ability to move from one functional state into another, 
and the definition of functional states with reference to the part they play in the operation of the entire entity - i.e. in reference to the other functional states. So long as the same process was achieved, the &quot;physical stuff&quot; -- that being computer hardware or biological structure -- could achieve consciousness.

This variety of functionalism was developed by Hilary Putnam. One of the major proponents of functionalism is Jerry Fodor.

==Dualism==
===Substance dualism===

This theory proposes that phenomenal experience occurs in a non-physical place. In Cartesian Dualism the non-physical place is an unextended soul that looks out at the brain. In Reid's Natural Dualism the non-physical place is a point-soul that looks out at the world.

===Property dualism===

Property dualism asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e., organized in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge. Property dualism is a branch of emergent materialism. The appeal to emergentism deserves closer attention. Scientific theories often deal with emergent phenomena, for instance an enzyme consists of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, manganese and oxygen and from this catalytic action emerges. The theory of enzyme structure and the action of this structure on the substrate explains how this emergence occurs. Notice that the theory of enzymes explains the emergence of catalytic activity; emergence does not explain the theory. In science the statement that some property will 'emerge' means that there will be a theory that accounts for this property. Property dualism, by appealing to emergence, is stating that some theory of consciousness will be possible. In other words it is an explanation that proposes that the explanation is yet to be known.

==Intentionalism==
==Higher order thought==
''This section is a stub and needs expansion''

==Eliminativism==

Eliminative materialism is the school of thought that argues for an absolute version of materialism with respect to mental entities and mental vocabulary. It principally argues that our common-sense understanding of the mind (often called 'folk psychology') is not a viable theory on which to base scientific investigation, and therefore no coherent neural basis will be found for many such everyday psychological concepts (such as belief or intention) and that behaviour and experience can only be adequately explained on the biological level.

Eliminative materialists therefore believe that consciousness does not exist and that the concept will eventually be eliminated as neuroscience progresses. Similarly, they argue that folk psychological concepts such as belief, desire and intention do not have any consistent neurological substrate.

Proponents of this view often make parallels to previous scientific theories which have been eliminated, such as the four humours theory of medicine, the phlogiston theory of combustion and 'vital force' theory of life. In these cases, science has not produced more detailed versions of these theories, but rejected them as obsolete. Eliminative materialists argue that folk psychology is headed the same way. According to W.V. Quine it will take tens of years before folk psychology will be replaced with real science. (see [[Consciousness Studies/The Conflict2#Phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness|Phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness]]).

Eliminative materialism was first defended by W.V. Quine, Paul Feyerabend, and Richard Rorty. This view is most associated with philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland although philosophers such as Daniel Dennett would also consider themselves eliminativists for many aspects of psychology. Philosopher Dale Jacquette has claimed that Occam's Razor is the rationale behind eliminativism and reductionism.

The most common argument against eliminative materialism is the argument from qualia, which is deployed in various forms by Thomas Nagel, Frank Jackson, and many others. Perhaps the most powerful argument against eliminativism is that experience itself is many things simultaneously; it is, as Aristotle points out, immediate and hence is not composed of judgements.

==Mysterianism==

New Mysterianism is a philosophy proposing that certain problems (in particular, consciousness) will never be explained.

Owen Flanagan noted in his 1991 book &quot;Science of the Mind&quot; that some modern thinkers have suggested that consciousness might never be completely explained. Flanagan called them &quot;the new mysterians&quot; after the rock group ? and the Mysterians. The term originated with the Japanese alien-invasion film The Mysterians. The &quot;old mysterians&quot; are thinkers throughout history who have put forward a similar position. They include Leibniz, Dr Johnson, and Thomas Huxley. The latter said, &quot;How is it that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djin, when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.&quot; [6, p. 229, quote]

Noam Chomsky distinguishes between problems, which seem solvable, at least in principle, through scientific methods, and mysteries which do not, even in principle. He notes that the cognitive capabilities of all organisms are limited by biology, e.g. a mouse will never speak. In the same way, certain problems may be beyond our understanding.

The term New Mysterianism has been extended by some writers to encompass the wider philosophical position that humans don't have the intellectual ability to understand many hard problems, not just the problem of consciousness, at a scientific level. This position is also known as Anti-Constructive Naturalism.

For example, in the mind-body problem, emergent materialism claims that humans aren't smart enough to determine &quot;the relationship between mind and matter.&quot; [4] Strong agnosticism is a religious application of this position.

Colin McGinn is the leading proponent of the New Mysterian position.

Critics argue this philosophy isn't useful and encourages capitulation. One critic noted:

the extreme &quot;Mysterian&quot; position, that there are vital issues forever beyond our reach, is in many ways deeply unsatisfying. [7]

On a film set, the power source is usually managed by the Electrical Department. Depending on where you are shooting and the volume of power the production requires, many different power sources are used. Typically you are either using Stage Power, House Power, A Tie-In, or a Generator.

==Stage Power==

When filming on a sound-stage large amounts of power are typically provided as part of the facility, although this is not always the case. Typically, power is provided in the form of 3-phase 110v with Cam-Lock hook-ups.

==House Power==

House power refers to power that is already installed within a location. For example, if you are shooting in a apartment, House Power refers to existing power installed in the apartment. House power is generally not preferred because: lighting equipment can require more power than is available, circuit-boxes can be difficult to locate in the event of a overload, a relatively large amount of power is usually used which increases the power-bill for that cycle.

==Tie-ins==

A Tie-In is a method of tapping directly into the power that feeds a building from the city power-grid, thereby bypassing the limits of the circuits that are installed in the building.

A Tie-In is a dangerous activity which requires experience and skill. Improper methods can result in damage to city power-grids and death.

==Generator==

Generators are used in Motion Picture Production to provide power to all the departments of the production, the most demanding on which is the lighting department. Typically generators are used when filming on location, as power is normally provided when filming on a sound-stage.

==Using BW Polaroids to determine contrast value for film productions==
Polaroids are a cost effective way to pre-visualize contrast values when shooting on
film.  The rush to proclaim Polaroid film dead is premature as Polaroid verification
of film contrast can save a film shoot thousands of dollars by preventing costly lighting
mistakes.  Most Successful Directors of Photography have developed other means 
for checking exposure, however for second unit shoots it can be an excellent way to avoid costly
mistakes. For low budget shoots where every dollar has already been squeezed, avoiding 
costly reshoots is a no brainer that the proper Polaroid set-up can help prevent.

Not just any polaroid camera will work however.  Specially modified Polaroid 110B cameras
are the polaroid of choice.  These cameras use Polaroid 664 and 667 film.

=Getting a video signal out of your camera=

==Video taps for film cameras==
Monitoring the image being recorded by a film camera requires that the film camera has been fitted with a 'video tap'.  This is just a little camera which sits near the view finder.  The image from these cameras is often of low quality and will flicker when the camera is rolling because the rotating shutter obscures the video tap's view.

==Digital output from video cameras==

=Monitors=

==Cabling==

If using coax connections then you must make sure the coax is properly terminated.  Some monitors have internal termination but these frequently fail.

==Monitoring on a CRT==
The desire to obsolete CRT monitoring is partially economically driven since picture tube manufacturing has been reduced 
by many well known manufacturers, including Sony.  However CRT monitoring is still recognized as one of the most
accurate methods of monitoring when a waveform/vectorscope is not available.  The desire to downsize the size of the monitor
and move to a flatter screen with less backend protrusion has been the desire of location production for many years now, but 
this size reduction has also resulted in less reliable monitoring, especially of the black levels.

==Monitoring on a laptop==

For DV and, soon, for HD, it is possible to monitor on a laptop.  The exact features are dependent on the software but it's usually possible to do the following things using a laptop hooked up to your camera whilst recording:

* Record direct-to-disk
* Monitor the exposure more closely using a virtual scope


===Examples of software which allows you to monitor on a laptop===
* Serious Magic's DVrack
* Canon's Console software

=Monitoring High Definition=

[[Image:Monitor_235.jpg|thumb|300px|An on-set high definition monitor hard-matted to the 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  [http://www.jack-kelly.com/gallery More production stills]]]

Consider doing location monitoring High Def.  Ailed the problems of backfocus associated to HD production, it's entirely possible that things can be soft, and then only spotted in the edit or later! Viewfinders are of course only wee monochrome monitors, and it's fraught with danger. Go for a 14&quot; and have a 9&quot; for those 'batt's only', estabilsihing shot, exteria quickies, (plenty of light, long depth of feild, da-de-da).

=Monitoring exposure=
It's generally A Bad Idea to judge your exposure using just the view finder.    There are several tools your can use to get a more accurate measure of your exposure:

==Using zebra==
Many modern DV cameras come with a zebra option.  This creates a white and black stripe pattern over areas of the picture that are over-exposed, allowing one to adjust the aperture, shutter speed, gain, etc. until there is no over-exposure.

==Using a 'scope to monitor exposure==

A scope shows you detailed information about the exposure of each shot by displaying a waveform for each channel (RGB).
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectorscope
&lt;small&gt;''To do: add pictures of scopes in action, write more details about how scopes help monitor exposure''&lt;/small&gt;

==Using a light meter==

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't understand...why would you paraphrase the KJV in order to study? First, there are swarms of paraphrases already published; second, if you want to understand the original meaning and intent of the writers, you'll have to study the Scriptures in the original languages (Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek) instead of simply converting 'thee' and 'thou' into modern English. Third, your admonition to be gender neutral is inconsistent with the original text of Scripture, because it was -not- gender neutral. This is a nice idea, but modernizing the English of the KJV is going to produce scant growth in the overall life of the Christian, in my opinion.
==Wow, Welcome to Modernity==
Sorry for the delayed response, I forgot to watch-list this page. This course is only for those who might want to venture into translation as a theological exercise. Most are afraid and just want to cast stones, but I am in up to my elbows and it is quite rewarding. I have expanded into Syriac, Coptic and Latin just like the church fathers. The gender issue came to a head at [[John 3|John 3:6]] and I decided to pursue it. The context of verse 3:5 is the breaking of water at birth, not baptism as most assume. That the original language would refer to the birthing woman as only &quot;flesh&quot; was corrected in Modernity. Even the Living Bible reads, &quot;Men can only reproduce human life.&quot; That may be &quot;biblical&quot; in your eyes, but a medical impossibility in mine. The Bible is all things to all people, and worthy of pursuit in what ever form.

A basic class that has not inherited anything can be broken into two parts, the variables and the methods.  The non-static variables are shoved into a simple data structure while the methods are compiled and called like every other function.

When you start adding in inheritance and polymorphism, things get a little more complicated.  For the purposes of simplicity, the structure of an object will be described in terms of having no inheritance.  At the end, however, inheritance and polymorphism will be covered.

=== Variables ===

All static variables defined in a class resides in the static region of memory for the entire duration of the application.  Every other variable defined in the class is placed into a data structure known as an object.  Typically when the constructor is called, the variables are placed into the object in sequential order,  see '''Figure 1'''.



&lt;small&gt;A:&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class ABC123 {
public:
	int a, b, c;
	ABC123():a(1), b(2), c(3) {};
};
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;small&gt;B:&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
0x00200000	dd 	1	;int a
0x00200004	dd	2	;int b
0x00200008	dd	3	;int c
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;table width=95%&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 1''': An example of what an object looks like in memory&lt;/br&gt;
'''Figure 1.A''': The definition for the class &quot;ABC123.&quot; This class has three integers, a, b, and c. The constructor sets 'a' to equal 1, 'b' to equal 2, and 'c' to equal 3.&lt;/br&gt;
'''Figure 1.B''': How the object ABC123 might be placed in memory, ordering the variables from the class sequentially.  At memory address 0x00200000 there is a double word integer (32 bits) with a value of 1, representing the variable 'a'. Memory address 0x00200004 has a double word integer with the value of 2, representing the variable 'b'.  And at memory address 0x00200008 there is a double word integer with a value of 3, representing the variable 'c'.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



However, the compiler typically needs the variables to be separated into sizes that are multiples of a word (2 bytes) in order to locate them.  Not all variables fit this requirement, namely char arrays; some unused bits might be used pad the variables so they meet this size requirement.  This is illustrated in '''Figure 2'''.

&lt;small&gt;A:&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class ABC123{
public:
	int a;
	char b[3];
	double c;

	ABC123():a(1),c(3) { strcpy(b,&quot;02&quot;); };
};&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;small&gt;B:&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
0x00200000	dd	1		;int a				; offset = abc123 + 0*word_size
0x00200004	db	'0'		;b[0] = '0'			; offset = abc123 + 2*word_size
0x00200005	db	'2'		;b[1] = '2'
0x00200006	db	0		;b[2] = null
0x00200007	db	0		;&lt;= UNUSED BYTE
0x00200008	dd	0x00000000	;double c,  lower 32 bits	; offset = abc123 + 4*word_size
0x0020000C	dd	0x40080000	;double c,  upper 32 bits
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;table width=95%&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 2''': An example of an object having a padded variable&lt;/br&gt;
'''Figure 2.A''': A new definition for the class &quot;ABC123.&quot; This class has one 32 bit integer, a.  One 3 byte char array, b. And one 64 bit double, c.  The constrictor sets 'a' to 1, 'b' to &quot;02&quot;, and 'c' to 3.&lt;/br&gt;
'''Figure 2.B''' Shows how ABC123 might be stored in memory. The first double word in the object is the variable 'a' at location 0x00200000 with a value of 1.  Variable 'b' starts at the memory location 0x00200004.  It's three bytes containing three chars, '0','2', and the null value. The next available address, 0x00200007, is unused since it's not a multiple of a word.  The last variable 'c', starts at 0x00200008 and it two double words (64 bits).  It contains the value 3.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


In order for the application to access one of these object variables, an object pointer needs to be offset to find the desired variable.  The offset of every variable is known by the compiler and written into the object code wherever it's needed.  '''Figure 3''' shows how to offset a pointer to retrieve variables.

&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
;abc123 = pointer to object
mov	eax, [abc123]	;eax = &amp;a	;offset = abc123+0*word_size 	= abc123
mov	ebx, [abc123+4]	;ebx = &amp;b	;offset = abc123+2*word_size 	= abc123+4
mov	ecx, [abc123+8]	;ecx = &amp;c	;offset = abc123+4*word_size 	= abc123+8
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Figure 3''': This shows how to offset a pointer to retrieve variables.  The first line places the address of variable 'a' into eax.  The second line places the address of variable 'b' into ebx. And the last line places the variable 'c' into ecx.

=== Methods ===

At a low level, there is almost no difference between a function and a method.  When decompiling, it can sometimes be hard to tell a difference between the two.  They both reside in the text memory space, and both are called the same way.  An example of how a method is called can be seen in '''Figure 4'''.


&lt;small&gt;A:&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
//method call
abc123-&gt;foo(1, 2, 3);
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;small&gt;B:&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
push 3			; int c
push 2			; int b
push 1			; int a
push [ebp-4]		; the address of the object
call 0x00434125	; call to method
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;table width=95%&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 4''': A method call.&lt;/br&gt;
'''Figure 4.A''': A method call in the C++ syntax. abc123 is a pointer to an object that has a method, foo().  foo() is taking three integer arguments, 1, 2, and 3.&lt;/br&gt;
'''Figure 4.B''' The same method call in x86 assembly. It takes four arguments, the address of the object and three integers.  The pointer to the object is at ebp-4 and the method is at address 0x00434125. &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



A notable characteristic in a method call is the address of the object being passed in as an argument.  This, however, is not a always a good indicator.  '''Figure 5''' shows function with the first argument being an object passed in by reference.  The result is function that looks identical to a method call.

&lt;small&gt;A:&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
//function call
foo(abc123, 1, 2, 3);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;small&gt;B:&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
push 3			; int c
push 2			; int b
push 1			; int a
push [ebp+4]		; the address of the object
call 0x00498372	; call to function
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;table width=95%&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 5''': A function call.&lt;/br&gt;
'''Figure 5.A:''' A function call in the C++ syntax. foo() is taking four arguments, one pointer and three integer arguments.&lt;/br&gt;
'''Figure 5.B:''' The same function call in x86 assembly. It takes four arguments, the address of the object and three integers.  The pointer to the object is at ebp-4 and the method is at address 0x00498372. &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

=== Inheritance &amp; Polymorphism === 

Inheritance and polymorphism completely changes the structure of a class, the object no longer contains just variables, they also contain pointers to the inherited methods.  This is due to the fact that polymorphism requires the address of a method or inner object to be figured out at runtime.

Take '''Figure 6''' into consideration. How does the application know to call D::one or C::one?  The answer is that the compiler figures out a convention in which to order variables and method pointers inside the object such that when they're referenced, the offsets are the same for any object that has inherited its methods and variables.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table border=0 margin=0 padding=0 width=95%&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
A *obj[2];
obj[0] = new C();
obj[1] = new D();

for(int i=0; i&lt;2; i++)
	obj[i]-&gt;one();
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 6''': A small C++ polymorphic loop that calls a function, one.  The classes C and D both inherit an abstract class, A.  The class A, for this code to work, must have a virtual method with the name, &quot;one.&quot; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The abstract class A acts as a blueprint for the compiler, defining an expected structure for any class that inherits it.  Every variable defined in class A and every virtual method defined in A will have the exact same offset for any of its children. '''Figure 7''' declares a possible inheritance scheme as well as it structure in memory.  Notice how the offset to C::one is the same as D::one, and the offset to C's copy of A::a is the same as D's copy.  In this, our polymorphic loop can just iterate through the array of pointers and know exactly where to find each method.



&lt;small&gt;A:&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class A{
public:
	int a;
	virtual void one() = 0;
};
class B{
public:
	int b;
	int c;
	virtual void two() = 0;
};
class C: public A{
public:
	int d;
	void one();
};
class D: public A, public B{
public:
	int e;
	void one();
	void two();
};
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;small&gt;B:&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
;Object C
0x00200000	dd	0x00423848	; address of C::one	;offset = 0*word_size
0x00200004	dd	1		; C's copy of A::a	;offset = 2*word_size
0x00200008	dd	4		; C::d			;offset = 4*word_size

;Object D
0x00200100	dd	0x00412348	; address of D::one	;offset = 0*word_size
0x00200104	dd	1		; D's copy of A::a	;offset = 2*word_size
0x00200108	dd	0x00431255	; address of D::two	;offset = 4*word_size
0x0020010C	dd	2		; D's copy of B::b	;offset = 6*word_size
0x00200110	dd	3		; D's copy of B::c	;offset = 8*word_size
0x00200114	dd	5		; D::e			;offset = 10*word_size
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;table width=95%&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 7''': A polymorphic inheritance scheme.&lt;/br&gt;
'''Figure 7.A''' defines the inheritance scheme.  It shows that class C inherits class A, and class D inherits class A and class B.&lt;/br&gt;
'''Figure 7.B''' shows how the inheritance scheme might be structured in memory. Class C's object has everything that was declared in class A in the first two double words.  The remainder of the object was defined by class C.  Class D's object also has everything that was declared in class A in the first two double words. Then the next three double words is everything declared in class B.  And the last double word is the variable defined by class D.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Variables == 

We've already seen some mechanisms to create local storage on the stack. This chapter will talk about some other variables, including '''global variables''', '''static variables''', variables labled &quot;'''const''',&quot; &quot;'''register''',&quot;  and &quot;'''volatile'''.&quot; It will also consider some general techniques concerning variables, including accessor and setter methods (to borrow from OO terminology). This section may also talk about setting memory breakpoints in a debugger to track memory I/O on a variable.

== How to Spot a Variable ==

Variables come in 2 distinct flavors: those that are created on the stack (local variables), and those that are accessed via a hardcoded memory address (global variables). Any memory that is accessed via a hard-coded address is usually a global variable. Variables that are accessed as an offset from esp, or ebp are frequently local variables. 

;Hardcoded address : Anything hardcoded is a value that is stored as-is in the binary, and is not changed at runtime. For instance, the value 0x2054 is hardcoded, whereas the current value of variable X is not hard-coded and may change at runtime. 

Example of a hardcoded address:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov eax, [0x77651010]
&lt;/source&gt;

OR:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov ecx, 0x77651010
 mov eax, [ecx]
&lt;/source&gt;

Example of a non-hardcoded (softcoded?) address:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov ecx, [esp + 4]
 add ecx, ebx
 mov eax, [ecx]
&lt;/source&gt;

In the last example, the value of ecx is calculated at run-time, whereas in the first 2 examples, the value is the same every time. RVAs are considered hard-coded addresses, even though the loader needs to &quot;fix them up&quot; to point to the correct locations.

== .BSS and .DATA sections ==

Both .bss and .data sections contain values which can change at run-time (e.g. ''variables''). Typically, variables that are initialized to a non-zero value in the source are allocated in the .data section (e.g.  &quot;int a = 10;&quot;). Variables that are not initialized, or initialized with a zero value, can be allocated to the .bss section (e.g. &quot;int arr[100];&quot;). Because all values of .bss variables are guaranteed to be zero at the start of the program, there is no need for the linker to allocate space in the binary file. Therefore, .bss sections do not take space in the binary file, regardless of their size.

== &quot;Static&quot; Local Variables ==

Local variables labeled '''static''' maintain their value across function calls, and therefore cannot be created on the stack like other local variables are. How are static variables created? Let's take a simple example C function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 void MyFunction(int a)
 {
 	static int x = 0;
 	printf(&quot;my number: &quot;);
 	printf(&quot;%d, %d\n&quot;, a, x);
 } 
&lt;/source&gt;

Compiling to a listing file with '''cl.exe''' gives us the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 _BSS	SEGMENT
 ?x@?1??MyFunction@@9@9 DD 01H DUP (?)   	; `MyFunction'::`2'::x
 _BSS	ENDS
 _DATA	SEGMENT
 $SG796	DB	'my number: ', 00H
 $SG797	DB	'%d, %d', 0aH, 00H
 _DATA	ENDS
 PUBLIC	_MyFunction
 EXTRN	_printf:NEAR
 ; Function compile flags: /Odt
 _TEXT	SEGMENT
 _a$ = 8					; size = 4
 _MyFunction PROC NEAR
 ; Line 4
 	push	ebp
 	mov	ebp, esp
 ; Line 6
 	push	OFFSET FLAT:$SG796
 	call	_printf
 	add	esp, 4
 ; Line 7
 	mov	eax, DWORD PTR ?x@?1??MyFunction@@9@9
 	push	eax
 	mov	ecx, DWORD PTR _a$[ebp]
 	push	ecx
 	push	OFFSET FLAT:$SG797
 	call	_printf
 	add	esp, 12					; 0000000cH
 ; Line 8
 	pop	ebp
 	ret	0
 _MyFunction ENDP
 _TEXT	ENDS
&lt;/source&gt;

Normally when assembly listings are posted in this wikibook, most of the code gibberish is discarded to aid readability, but in this instance, the &quot;gibberish&quot; contains the answer we are looking for. As can be clearly seen, this function creates a standard stack frame, and it doesn't create any local variables on the stack. In the interests of being complete, we will take baby-steps here, and work to the conclusion logically.

In the code for Line 7, there is a call to _printf with 3 arguments. Printf is a standard '''libc''' function, and it therefore can be assumed to be cdecl calling convention. Arguments are pushed, therefore, from right to left. Three arguments are pushed onto the stack before _printf is called:

*&lt;code&gt;DWORD PTR ?x@?1??MyFunction@@9@9&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;DWORD PTR _a$[ebp]&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;OFFSET FLAT:$SG797&lt;/code&gt;

The second one, _a$[ebp] is partially defined in this assembly instruction:

 _a$ = 8

And therefore _a$[ebp] is the variable located at offset +8 from ebp, or the first argument to the function. OFFSET FLAT:$SG797 likewise is declared in the assembly listing as such:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 SG797	DB	'%d, %d', 0aH, 00H
&lt;/source&gt;

If you have your ASCII table handy, you will notice that 0aH = 0x0A = '\n'. OFFSET FLAT:$SG797 then is the format string to our printf statement. Our last option then is the mysterious-looking &quot;?x@?1??MyFunction@@9@9&quot;, which is defined in the following assembly code section:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 _BSS	SEGMENT
 ?x@?1??MyFunction@@9@9 DD 01H DUP (?) 
 _BSS	ENDS
&lt;/source&gt;

This shows that the Microsoft C compiler creates static variables in the .bss section. This might not be the same for all compilers, but the lesson is the same: local static variables are created and used in a very similar, if not the exact same, manner as global values. In fact, as far as the reverser is concerned, the two are usually interchangeable. Remember, the only real difference between static variables and global variables is the idea of &quot;scope&quot;, which is only used by the compiler.

== Signed and Unsigned Variables ==

Integer formatted variables, such as '''int''', '''char''', '''short''' and '''long''' may be declared signed or unsigned variables in the C source code. There are two differences in how these variables are treated:
#Signed variables use signed instructions such as '''add''', and '''sub'''. Unsigned variables use unsigned arithmetic instructions such as '''addi''', and '''subi'''.
#Signed variables use signed branch instructions such as '''jge''' and '''jl'''. Unsigned variables use unsigned branch instructions such as '''jae''', and '''jb'''. 

The difference between signed and unsigned instructions is the conditions under which the various flags for greater-than or less-than (overflow flags) are set. The integer result values are exactly the same for both signed and unsigned data. 

== Floating-Point Values ==

Floating point values tend to be 32-bit data values (for '''float''') or 64-bit data values (for '''double'''). These values are distinguished from ordinary integer-valued variables because they are used with floating-point instructions. Floating point instructions typically start with the letter ''f''. For instance, '''fadd''', '''fcmp''', and similar instructions are used with floating point values. Of particular note are the '''fload''' instruction and variants. These instructions take an integer-valued variable and converts it into a floating point variable.

We will discuss floating point variables in more detail in a later chapter.

== Global Variables ==

Global variables do not have a limited scope like lexical variables do inside a function body. Since the notion of lexical scope implies the use of the system stack, and since global variables are not lexical in nature, they are typically not found on the stack. Global variables tend to exist in the program as a hard-coded memory address, a location which never changes throughout program execution. These could exist in the DATA segment of the executable, or anywhere else that a hard-coded memory address can be used to store data.

In C, global variables are defined outside the body of any function. There is no &quot;global&quot; keyword. Any variable which is not defined inside a function is global. In C however, a variable which is not defined inside a function is only global to the particular source code file in which it is defined. For example, we have two files &lt;code&gt;Foo.c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Bar.c&lt;/code&gt;, and a global variable &lt;code&gt;MyGlobalVar&lt;/code&gt;:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Foo.c
! Bar.c
|-
|&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int MyGlobalVar;

int GetVarFoo(void)
{
  //right!
  return MyGlobalVar;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int GetVarBar(void)
{
  //wrong!
  return MyGlobalVar; 
}
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

In the example above, the variable &lt;code&gt;MyGlobalVar&lt;/code&gt; is visible inside the file &lt;code&gt;Foo.c&lt;/code&gt;, but is not visible inside the file &lt;code&gt;Bar.c&lt;/code&gt;. To make &lt;code&gt;MyGlobalVar&lt;/code&gt; visible inside all project files, we need to use the &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; keyword, which we will discuss below.

=== &quot;&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;&quot; Variables ===

The C programming language specifies a special keyword &quot;&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to define variables which are lexical to the function (they cannot be referenced from outside the function) but they maintain their values across function calls. Unlike ordinary lexical variables which are created on the stack when the function is entered and are destroyed from the stack when the function returns, static variables are created once and are never destroyed. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int MyFunction(void) 
{
  static int x;
  ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Static variables in C are global variables, except the compiler takes precautions to prevent the variable from being accessed outside of the parent function's scope. Like global variables, static variables are referenced using a hardcoded memory address, not a location on the stack like ordinary variables. However unlike globals, static variables are only used inside a single function. There is no difference between a global variable which is only used in a single function, and a static variable inside that same function. However, it's good programming practice to limit the number of global variables, so when disassembling, you should prefer interpreting these variables as static instead of global. 

=== &quot;&lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;&quot; Variables ===

The &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; keyword is used by a C compiler to indicate that a particular variable is global to the entire project, not just to a single source code file. Besides this distinction, and the slightly larger lexical scope of extern variables, they should be treated like ordinary global variables. 

In static libraries, variables marked as being extern might be available for use with programs which are linked to the library.

=== Global Variables Summary ===

Here is a table to summarize some points about global variables:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|
! How it's referenced 
! Lexical scope
! Notes
|-
! &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; variables
| Hard-coded memory address, only in one function
| One function only
| In disassembly, indistinguishable from global variables except that it's only used in one function.  A global variable is only static if it's never used in another function.
|-
! Global variables
| Hard-coded memory address, only in one file
| One source code file only
| Global variables are only used in a single file. This can help you when disassembling to get a rough estimate for how the original source code was arranged. 
|-
! &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; variables
| Hard-coded memory address, in the entire project
| The entire project
| Extern variables are available for use in all functions of a project, and in programs linked to the project (external libraries, for example).
|}

When disassembling, a hard-coded memory address should be considered to be an ordinary global variable unless you can determine from the scope of the variable that it is static or extern.

== Constants ==

Variables qualified with the '''const''' keyword (in C) are frequently stored in the .data section of the executable. Constant values can be distinguished because they are initialized at the beginning of the program, and are never modified by the program itself. For this reasons, some compilers may chose to store constant variables (especially strings) in the .text section of the executable, thus allowing the sharing of these variables across multiple instances of the same process. This creates a big problem for the reverser, who now has to decide whether the code he's looking at is part of a constant variable or part of a subroutine.

== &quot;Volatile&quot; memory == 

In C and C++, variables can be declared &quot;volatile,&quot; which tells the compiler that the memory location can be accessed from ''external'' or ''concurrent'' processes, and that the compiler should not perform any optimizations on the variable. For instance, if multiple threads were all accessing and modifying a single global value, it would be bad for the compiler to store that variable in a register sometimes, and flush it to memory infrequently. In general, Volatile memory must be flushed to memory after every calculation, to ensure that the most current version of the data is in memory when other processes come to look for it.

It is not always possible to determine from a disassembly listing whether a given variable is a volatile variable. However, if the variable is accessed frequently from memory, and its value is constantly updated in memory (especially if there are free registers available), that's a good hint that the variable might be volatile.

== Simple Accessor Methods ==

An Accessor Method is a tool derived from OO theory and practice. In it's most simple form, an accessor method is a function that receives no parameters (or perhaps simply an offset), and returns the value of a variable. Accessor and Setter methods are ways to restrict access to certain variables. The only standard way to get the value of the variable is to use the Accessor.

Accessors can prevent some simple problems, such as out-of-bounds array indexing, and using uninitialized data. Frequently, Accessors contain little or no error-checking.

Here is an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov eax, [ecx + 8] ;THISCALL function, passes &quot;this&quot; pointer in ecx
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret
&lt;/source&gt;

Because they are so simple, accessor methods are frequently heavily optimized (they generally don't need a stack frame), and are even occasionally ''inlined'' by the compiler.

== Simple Setter (Manipulator) Methods ==

Setter methods are the antithesis of an accessor method, and provide a unified way of altering the value of a given variable. Setter methods will often take as a parameter the value to be set to the variable, although some methods (Initializers) simply set the variable to a pre-defined value. Setter methods often do bounds checking, and error checking on the variable before it is set, and frequently either a) return no value, or b) return a simple boolean value to determine success.

Here is an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 cmp [ebp + 8], 0
 je error
 mov eax, [ebp + 8]
 mov [ecx + 0], eax
 mov eax, 1
 jmp end
 :error
 mov eax, 0
 :end
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 ret
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

== Data Structures ==

Few programs can work by using simple memory storage; most need to utilize complex data objects, including '''pointers''', '''arrays''', '''structures''', and other complicated types. This chapter will talk about how compilers implement complex data objects, and how the reverser can identify these objects.

== Arrays ==

Arrays are simply a storage scheme for multiple data objects of the same type. Data objects are stored sequentially, often as an offset from a pointer to the beginning of the array. Consider the following C code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 x = array[25];
&lt;/source&gt;

Which is identical to the following asm code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov ebx, $array
 mov eax, [ebx + 25]
 mov $x, eax
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, consider the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int MyFunction1()
 {
    int array[20];
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;

This (roughly) translates into the following asm pseudo-code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 :_MyFunction1
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 sub esp, 80 ;the whole array is created on the stack!!!
 lea $array, [esp + 0] ;a pointer to the array is saved in the array variable
 ...
&lt;/source&gt;

The entire array is created on the stack, and the pointer to the bottom of the array is stored in the variable &quot;array&quot;. An optimizing compiler could ignore the last instruction, and simply refer to the array via a +0 offset from esp (in this example), but we will do things verbosely.

Likewise, consider the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 void MyFunction2()
 {
    char buffer[4];
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;

This will translate into the following asm pseudo-code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 :_MyFunction2
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 sub esp, 4
 lea $buffer, [esp + 0]
 ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Which looks harmless enough. But, what if a program inadvertantly accesses buffer[4]? what about buffer[5]? what about buffer[8]? This is the makings of a buffer overflow vulnerability, and (might) will be discussed in a later section. However, this section won't talk about security issues, and instead will focus only on data structures.

===  Spotting an Array on the Stack ===

To spot an array on the stack, look for large amounts of local storage allocated on the stack (&quot;sub esp, 1000&quot;, for example), and look for large portions of that data being accessed by an offset from a different register from esp. For instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 :_MyFunction3
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 sub esp, 256
 lea ebx, [esp + 0x00]
 mov [ebx + 0], 0x00
&lt;/source&gt;

is a good sign of an array being created on the stack. Granted, an optimizing compiler might just want to offset from esp instead, so you will need to be careful.

=== Spotting an Array in Memory ===

Arrays in memory, such as global arrays, or arrays which have initial data (remember, initialized data is created in the .data section in memory) and will be accessed as offsets from a hardcoded address in memory:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 :_MyFunction4
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov esi, 0x77651004
 mov ebx, 0x00000000
 mov [esi + ebx], 0x00
&lt;/source&gt;
 
It needs to be kept in mind that structures and classes might be accessed in a similar manner, so the reverser needs to remember that all the data objects in an array are of the same type, that they are sequential, and they will often be handled in a loop of some sort. Also, (and this might be the most important part), each elements in an array may be accessed by a ''variable offset from the base''.

Since most times an array is accessed through a computed index, not through a constant, the compiler will likely use the following to access an element of the array:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov [ebx + eax], 0x00
&lt;/source&gt;

If the array holds elements larger than 1 byte (for char), the index will need to be multiplied by the size of the element, yielding code similar to the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov [ebx + eax * 4], 0x11223344   # access to an array of DWORDs, e.g.    arr[i] = 0x11223344
 ...
 mul eax, $20                      # access to an array of structs, each 20 bytes long
 lea edi, [ebx + eax]              # e.g.     ptr = &amp;arr[i]
&lt;/source&gt;

This pattern can be used to distinguish between accesses to arrays and accesses to structure data members.

== Structures ==

All C programmers are going to be familiar with the following syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 struct MyStruct 
 {
    int FirstVar;
    double SecondVar;
    unsigned short int ThirdVar;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

It's called a '''structure''' (Pascal programmers may know a similar concept as a &quot;record&quot;).

Structures may be very big or very small, and they may contain all sorts of different data. Structures may look very similar to arrays in memory, but a few key points need to be remembered: structures do not need to contain data fields of all the same type, structure fields are often 4-byte aligned (not sequential), and each element in a structure has its own offset. It therefore makes no sense to reference a structure element by a variable offset from the base.

Take a look at the following structure definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 struct MyStruct2
 {
    long value1;
    short value2;
    long value3;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Assuming the pointer to the base of this structure is loaded into ebx, we can access these members in one of two schemes:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;50%&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 ;data is 32-bit aligned
 [ebx + 0] ;value1
 [ebx + 4] ;value2
 [ebx + 8] ;value3
&lt;/source&gt;
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 ;data is &quot;packed&quot;
 [ebx + 0] ;value1
 [ebx + 4] ;value2
 [ebx + 6] ;value3
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

The first arrangement is the most common, but it clearly leaves open an entire memory word (2 bytes) at offset +6, which is not used at all. Compilers occasionally allow the programmer to manually specify the offset of each data member, but this isn't always the case. The second example also has the benefit that the reverser can easily identify that each data member in the structure is a different size.

Consider now the following function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 :_MyFunction
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 lea ecx, SS:[ebp + 8]
 mov [ecx + 0], 0x0000000A
 mov [ecx + 4], ecx
 mov [ecx + 8], 0x0000000A
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
&lt;/source&gt;

The function clearly takes a pointer to a data structure as its first argument. Also, each data member is the same size (4 bytes), so how can we tell if this is an array or a structure? To answer that question, we need to remember one important distinction between structures and arrays: the elements in an array are all of the same type, the elements in a structure do not need to be the same type. Given that rule, it is clear that one of the elements in this structure is a pointer (it points to the base of the structure itself!) and the other two fields are loaded with the hex value 0x0A (10 in decimal), which is certainly not a valid pointer on any system I have ever used. We can then partially recreate the structure and the function code below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 struct MyStruct3
 {
    long value1;
    void *value2;
    long value3;
 }

 void MyFunction2(struct MyStruct3 *ptr)
 {
    ptr-&gt;value1 = 10;
    ptr-&gt;value2 = ptr;
    ptr-&gt;value3 = 10;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

As a quick aside note, notice that this function doesn't load anything into eax, and therefore it doesn't return a value.

== Advanced Structures ==

Lets say we have the following situation in a function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 :MyFunction1
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 mov esi, [ebp + 8]
 lea ecx, SS:[esi + 8]
 ...
&lt;/source&gt;

what is happening here? First, esi is loaded with the value of the function's first parameter (ebp + 8). Then, ecx is loaded with a pointer to the offset +8 from esi. It looks like we have 2 pointers accessing the same data structure!

The function in question could easily be one of the following 2 prototypes:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 struct MyStruct1
 {
   DWORD value1;
   DWORD value2;
   struct MySubStruct1
   {
      ...
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 struct MyStruct2
 {
    DWORD value1;
    DWORD value2;
    DWORD array[LENGTH];
    ...
&lt;/source&gt;

one pointer offset from another pointer in a structure often means a complex data structure. There are far too many combinations of structures and arrays, however, so this wikibook will not spend too much time on this subject.

== Identifying Structs and Arrays ==

Array elements and structure fields are both accessed as offsets from the array/structure pointer. When disassembling, how do we tell these data structures apart? Here are some pointers:

#array elements are not meant to be accessed individually. Array elements are typically accessed using a variable offset
#Arrays are frequently accessed in a loop. Because arrays typically hold a series of similar data items, the best way to access them all is usually a loop. Specifically, &lt;code&gt;for(x = 0; x &lt; length_of_array; x++)&lt;/code&gt; style loops are often used to access arrays, although there can be others.
#All the elements in an array have the same data type.  
#Struct fields are typically accessed using constant offsets.
#Struct fields are typically not accessed in order, and are also not accessed using loops.
#Struct fields are not typically all the same data type, or the same data width

== Linked Lists and Binary Trees ==

Two common structures used when programming are linked lists and binary trees. These two structures in turn can be made more complicated in a number of ways. Shown in the images below are examples of a linked list structure and a binary tree structure.

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
| width=&quot;50%&quot; | [[Image:C language linked list.png|center|400px]]
| [[Image:tree-data-structure.svg|center|300px]]
|}

Each node in a linked list or a binary tree contains some amount of data, and a pointer (or pointers) to other nodes. Consider the following asm code example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
loop_top:
cmp [ebp + 0], 10
je loop_end
mov ebp, [ebp + 4]
jmp loop_top
loop_end:
&lt;/source&gt;

At each loop iteration, a data value at [ebp + 0] is compared with the value 10. If the two are equal, the loop is ended. If the two are not equal, however, the pointer in ebp is updated with a pointer at an offset from ebp, and the loop is continued. This is a classic linked-loop search technique. This is analagous to the following C code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
struct node 
{
  int data;
  struct node *next;
};

struct node *x;
...
while(x-&gt;data != 10)
{
  x = x-&gt;next;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Binary trees are the same, except two different pointers will be used (the right and left branch pointers).</text>

== Branching == 

Computer science professors tell their students to avoid jumps and '''goto''' instructions, to avoid the proverbial &quot;spaghetti code.&quot; Unfortunately, assembly only has jump instructions to control program flow. This chapter will explore the subject that many people avoid like the plague, and will attempt to show how the spaghetti of assembly can be translated into the more familiar control structures of high-level language. Specifically, this chapter will focus on '''If-Then-Else''' and '''Switch''' branching instructions.

== If-Then ==

Let's consider a generic '''if''' statement in pseudo-code followed by its equivalent form using jumps:

{|width=&quot;70%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|
 if (condition) then
  do_action;

 if not (condition) then goto end;
   do_action;
 end:
|[[Image: C language if.png|center]]
|}

What does this code do? In English, the code checks the condition and performs a jump only if it is ''false''.
With that in mind, let's compare some actual C code and its Assembly translation: 

{|
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot; width=90&gt;
 if(x == 0)
 {
   x = 1;
 }
 x++;
&lt;/source&gt;
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov eax, $x
 cmp eax, 0
 jne end
 mov eax, 1
 end:
 inc eax
 mov $x, eax
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Note that when we translate to assembly, we need to ''negate'' the condition of the jump because--like we said above--we only jump if the condition is false. To recreate the high-level code, simply negate the condition once again.

Negating a comparison may be tricky if you're not paying attention. Here are the correct dual forms:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Instruction !! Meaning
|-
| JNE || '''J'''ump if '''n'''ot '''e'''qual
|-
| JE || '''J'''ump if '''e'''qual
|-
| JG || '''J'''ump if '''g'''reater 
|-
| JLE || '''J'''ump if '''l'''ess than or '''e'''qual
|-
| JL || '''J'''ump if '''l'''ess than 
|-
| JGE || '''J'''ump if '''g'''reater or '''e'''qual
|}

And here are some examples.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov eax, $x                     //move x into eax
 cmp eax, $y                     //compare eax with y
 jg end                          //jump if greater than
 inc eax
 move $x, eax                    //increment x
 end:
 ...
&lt;/source&gt;

Is produced by these C statements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 if(x &lt;= y)
 {
    x++;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, x is incremented only if it is '''less than or equal to''' y. Thus, if it is greater than y, it will not be incremented as in the assembler code. Similarly, the C code

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 if(x &lt; y)
 {
    x++;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

produces this assembler code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov eax, $x                        //move x into eax
 cmp eax, $y                        //compare eax with y
 jge end                            //jump if greater than or equal to
 inc eax
 move $x, eax                       //increment x
 end:
 ...
&lt;/source&gt;

X is incremented in the C code only if it is '''less than''' y, so the assembler code now jumps if it's greater than or equal to y. This kind of thing takes practice, so we will try to include lots of examples in this section.

== If-Then-Else ==

Let us now look at a more complicated case: the '''If-Then-Else''' instruction.

{| width=&quot;80%&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|
 if (condition) then
   do_action
 else
   do_alternative_action;

 if not (condition) goto else;
   do_action;
   goto end;
 else:
   do_alternative_action;
 end:
|[[Image:C language if else.png|center]]
|}

Now, what happens here? Like before, the if statement only jumps to the else clause when the condition is false. However, we must also install an ''unconditional'' jump at the end of the &quot;then&quot; clause, so we don't perform the else clause directly afterwards.

Now, here is an example of a real C If-Then-Else:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 if(x == 10)
 {
    x = 0;
 }
 else
 {
    x++;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Which gets translated into the following assembly code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov eax, $x
 cmp eax, 0x0A ;0x0A = 10
 jne else
 mov eax, 0
 jmp end
 else:
 inc eax
 end:
 mov $x, eax
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, the addition of a single unconditional jump can add an entire extra option to our conditional.

== Switch-Case ==

'''Switch-Case''' structures can be very complicated when viewed in assembly language, so we will examine a few examples. First, keep in mind that in C, there are several keywords that are commonly used in a switch statement. Here is a recap:

;Switch : This keyword tests the argument, and starts the switch structure
;Case : This creates a label that execution will switch to, depending on the value of the argument.
;Break : This statement jumps to the end of the switch block
;Default : This is the label that execution jumps to if and only if it doesn't match up to any other conditions

Lets say we have a general switch statement, but with an extra label at the end, as such:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 switch (x)
 {
 //body of switch statement
 }
 end_of_switch:
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, every '''break''' statement will be immediately replaced with the statement

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 jmp end_of_switch
&lt;/source&gt;

But what do the rest of the statements get changed to? The case statements can each resolve to any number of arbitrary integer values. How do we test for that? The answer is that we use a &quot;Switch Table&quot;. Here is a simple, C example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int main(int argc, char **argv)
 { //line 10
 	switch(argc)
 	{
 		case 1:
 			MyFunction(1);
 			break;
 		case 2:
 			MyFunction(2);
 			break;
 		case 3:
 			MyFunction(3);
 			break;
 		case 4:
 			MyFunction(4);
 			break;
 		default:
 			MyFunction(5);
 	}
 	return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

And when we compile this with '''cl.exe''', we can generate the following listing file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 tv64 = -4		; size = 4
 _argc$ = 8		; size = 4
 _argv$ = 12		; size = 4
 _main	PROC NEAR
 ; Line 10
 	push	ebp
 	mov	ebp, esp
 	push	ecx
 ; Line 11
 	mov	eax, DWORD PTR _argc$[ebp]
 	mov	DWORD PTR tv64[ebp], eax
 	mov	ecx, DWORD PTR tv64[ebp]
 	sub	ecx, 1
 	mov	DWORD PTR tv64[ebp], ecx
 	cmp	DWORD PTR tv64[ebp], 3
 	ja	SHORT $L810
 	mov	edx, DWORD PTR tv64[ebp]
 	jmp	DWORD PTR $L818[edx*4]
 $L806:
 ; Line 14
 	push	1
 	call	_MyFunction
 	add	esp, 4
 ; Line 15
 	jmp	SHORT $L803
 $L807:
 ; Line 17
 	push	2
 	call	_MyFunction
 	add	esp, 4
 ; Line 18
        jmp     SHORT $L803
 $L808:
 ; Line 19
 	push	3
 	call	_MyFunction
 	add	esp, 4
 ; Line 20
 	jmp	SHORT $L803
 $L809:
 ; Line 22
 	push	4
 	call	_MyFunction
 	add	esp, 4
 ; Line 23
 	jmp	SHORT $L803
 $L810:
 ; Line 25
 	push	5
 	call	_MyFunction
 	add	esp, 4
 $L803:
 ; Line 27
 	xor	eax, eax
 ; Line 28
 	mov	esp, ebp
 	pop	ebp
 	ret	0
 $L818:
 	DD	$L806
 	DD	$L807
 	DD	$L808
 	DD	$L809
 _main	ENDP
&lt;/source&gt;

Lets work our way through this. First, we see that line 10 sets up our standard stack frame, and it also saves ecx. Why does it save ecx? Scanning through the function, we never see a corresponding &quot;pop ecx&quot; instruction, so it seems that the value is never restored at all. In fact, the compiler isn't saving ecx at all, but is instead simply reserving space on the stack: it's creating a local variable. The original C code didn't have any local variables, however, so perhaps the compiler just needed some extra scratch space to store intermediate values. Why doesn't the compiler execute the more familiar &quot;sub esp, 4&quot; command to create the local variable? '''push ecx''' is just a faster instruction that does the same thing. This &quot;scratch space&quot; is being referenced by a ''negative offset'' from ebp. '''tv64''' was defined in the beginning of the listing as having the value -4, so every call to &quot;tv64[ebp]&quot; is a call to this scratch space.

There are a few things that we need to notice about the function in general: 

*Label $L803 is the end_of_switch label. Therefore, every &quot;jmp SHORT $L803&quot; statement is a '''break'''. This is verifiable by comparing with the C code line-by-line.
*Label $L818 contains a list of hard-coded memory addresses, which here are labels in the code section! Remember, labels resolve to the memory address of the instruction. This must be an important part of our puzzle.

To solve this puzzle, we will take an in-depth look at line 11:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov	eax, DWORD PTR _argc$[ebp]
 mov	DWORD PTR tv64[ebp], eax
 mov	ecx, DWORD PTR tv64[ebp]
 sub	ecx, 1
 mov	DWORD PTR tv64[ebp], ecx
 cmp	DWORD PTR tv64[ebp], 3
 ja	SHORT $L810
 mov	edx, DWORD PTR tv64[ebp]
 jmp	DWORD PTR $L818[edx*4]
&lt;/source&gt;

This sequence performs the following pseudo-C operation:

 if( argc - 1 &gt;= 4 )
 {
    goto $L810;   /* the default */
 }
 label *L818[] = { $L806, $L807, $L808, $L809 };  /* define a table of jumps, one per each case */
 //
 goto L818[argc - 1];   /* use the address from the table to jump to the correct case */

Here's why...

=== The Setup ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov	eax, DWORD PTR _argc$[ebp]
 mov	DWORD PTR tv64[ebp], eax
 mov	ecx, DWORD PTR tv64[ebp]
 sub	ecx, 1
 mov	DWORD PTR tv64[ebp], ecx
&lt;/source&gt;

The value of argc is moved into eax. The value of eax is then immediately moved to the scratch space. The value of the scratch space is then moved into ecx. Sounds like an awfully convoluted way to get the same value into so many different locations, but remember: I turned off the optimizations. The value of ecx is then decremented by 1. Why didn't the compiler use a '''dec''' instruction instead? Perhaps the statement is a general statement, that in this case just happens to have an argument of 1. We don't know why exactly, all we know is this:

*'''eax = &quot;scratch pad&quot;'''
*'''ecx = eax - 1'''

Finally, the last line moves the new, decremented value of ecx ''back into the scratch pad''. Very inefficient.

=== The Compare and Jumps ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 cmp	DWORD PTR tv64[ebp], 3
 ja	SHORT $L810
&lt;/source&gt;
 
The value of the scratch pad is compared with the value 3, and if the ''unsigned'' value is above 3 (4 or more), execution jumps to label $L810. How do I know the value is unsigned? I know because '''ja''' is an unsigned conditional jump. Let's look back at the original C code switch:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
        switch(argc)
 	{
 		case 1:
 			MyFunction(1);
 			break;
 		case 2:
 			MyFunction(2);
 			break;
 		case 3:
 			MyFunction(3);
 			break;
 		case 4:
 			MyFunction(4);
 			break;
 		default:
 			MyFunction(5);
 	}
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember, the scratch pad contains the value (argc - 1), which means that this condition is only triggered when argc &gt; 4. What happens when argc is greater than 4? The function goes to the default condition. Now, let's look at the next two lines:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov	edx, DWORD PTR tv64[ebp]
 jmp	DWORD PTR $L818[edx*4]
&lt;/source&gt;

'''edx''' gets the value of the scratch pad (argc - 1), and then there is a very weird jump that takes place: execution jumps to a location pointed to by the value (edx * 4 + $L818). What is $L818? We will examine that right now.

=== The Switch Table ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 $L818:
  	DD	$L806
  	DD	$L807
 	DD	$L808
 	DD	$L809
&lt;/source&gt;

$L818 is a pointer, in the code section, to a list of other code section pointers. These pointers are all 32bit values (DD is a DWORD). Let's look back at our jump statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 jmp	DWORD PTR $L818[edx*4]
&lt;/source&gt;

In this jump, $L818 ''isn't the offset, it's the base'', edx*4 is the offset. As we said earlier, edx contains the value of (argc - 1). If argc == 1, we jump to [$L818 + 0] which is $L806. If argc == 2, we jump to [$L818 + 4], which is $L807. Get the picture? A quick look at labels $L806, $L807, $L808, and $L809 shows us exactly what we expect to see: the bodies of the '''case''' statements from the original C code, above. Each one of the case statements calls the function &quot;MyFunction&quot;, then breaks, and then jumps to the end of the switch block.

== Ternary Operator ?: ==

Again, the best way to learn is by doing. Therefore we will go through a mini example to explain the ternary operator. Consider the following C code program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 int main(int argc, char **argv)
 {
    return (argc &gt; 1)?(5):(0);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

'''cl.exe''' produces the following assembly listing file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 _argc$ = 8						; size = 4
 _argv$ = 12						; size = 4
 _main	PROC NEAR
 ; File c:\documents and settings\andrew\desktop\test2.c
 ; Line 2
 	push	ebp
 	mov	ebp, esp
 ; Line 3
 	xor	eax, eax
 
        cmp	DWORD PTR _argc$[ebp], 1
        setle	al
        dec	eax
        and	eax, 5
 ; Line 4
 	pop	ebp
 	ret	0
 _main	ENDP
&lt;/source&gt;

Line 2 sets up a stack frame, and line 4 is a standard exit sequence. There are no local variables. It is clear that Line 3 is where we want to look.

The instruction &quot;xor eax, eax&quot; simply sets eax to 0. For more information on that line, see the chapter on [[../Code Obfuscation|unintuitive instructions]]. The '''cmp''' instruction tests the condition of the ternary operator. The '''setle''' function is one of a set of x86 functions that works like a conditional move: al gets the value 1 if argc &lt;= 1. Isn't that the exact opposite of what we wanted? In this case, it is. Let's look at what happens when argc = 0: '''al''' gets the value 1. '''al''' is decremented (al = 0), and then eax is logically anded with 5. 5 &amp; 0 = 0. When argc == 2 (greater than 1), the '''setle''' instruction doesn't do anything, and eax still is zero. eax is then decremented, which means that eax == -1. What is -1?

In x86 processors, negative numbers are stored in '''two's-complement''' format. For instance, let's look at the following C code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 BYTE x;
 x = -1;
&lt;/source&gt;

At the end of this C code, '''x''' will have the value 11111111: all ones!

When argc is greater than 1, setle sets al to zero. Decrementing this value sets every bit in eax to a logical 1. Now, when we perform the logical '''and''' function we get:

  ...11111111
 &amp;...00000101     ;101 is 5 in binary
 ------------
  ...00000101

eax gets the value 5. In this case, it's a roundabout method of doing it, but as a reverser, this is the stuff you need to worry about.

For reference, here is the GCC assembly output of the same ternary operator from above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 _main:
 pushl	%ebp
 movl	%esp, %ebp
 subl	$8, %esp
 xorl	%eax, %eax
 andl	$-16, %esp
 call	__alloca
 call	___main
 xorl	%edx, %edx
 cmpl	$2, 8(%ebp)
 setge	%dl
 leal	(%edx,%edx,4), %eax
 leave
 ret
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that GCC produces slightly different code than cl.exe produces. However, the stack frame is set up the same way. Notice also that GCC doesn't give us line numbers, or other hints in the code. The ternary operator line occurs after the instruction &quot;call __main&quot;. Let's highlight that section here:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 xorl	%edx, %edx
 cmpl	$2, 8(%ebp)
 setge	%dl
 leal	(%edx,%edx,4), %eax
&lt;/source&gt;

Again, '''xor'''  is used to set edx to 0 quickly. Argc is tested against 2 (instead of 1), and dl is set if argc is ''greater then or equal''. If dl gets set to 1, the '''leal''' instruction directly thereafter will move the value of 5 into eax (because lea (edx,edx,4) means edx + edx * 4, i.e. edx * 5).</text>

== Loops == 

To complete repetitive tasks, programmers often implement '''loops'''. There are many sorts of loops, but they can all be boiled down to a few similar formats in assembly code. This chapter will discuss loops, how to identify them, and how to &quot;decompile&quot; them back into high-level representations.

== Do-While Loops ==

It seems counterintuitive that this section will consider '''Do-While''' loops first, considering that they might be the least used of all the variations in practice. However, there is method to our madness, so read on.

Consider the following generic Do-While loop:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
| width=&quot;50%&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 do
 {
    action;
 } while(condition);
&lt;/source&gt;
|[[Image:C language do while.png|center]]
|}

What does this loop do? The loop body simply executes, the condition is tested at the end of the loop, and the loop jumps back to the beginning of the loop if the condition is satisfied. Unlike '''if''' statements, Do-While conditions are not reversed. 

Let us now take a look at the following C code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 do
 {
   x++;
 } while(x != 10);
&lt;/source&gt;

Which can be translated into assembly language as such:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov eax, $x
 beginning:
 inc eax
 cmp eax, 0x0A ;0x0A = 10
 jne beginning
 mov $x, eax
&lt;/source&gt;

== While Loops ==

'''While''' loops look almost as simple as a '''Do-While''' loop, but in reality they aren't as simple at all. Let's examine a generic while-loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 while(x)
 {
    //loop body
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

What does this loop do? First, the loop checks to make sure that x is true. If x is not true, the loop is skipped. The loop body is then executed, followed by another check: is x still true? If x is still true, execution jumps back to the top of the loop, and execution continues. Keep in mind that there needs to be a jump at the bottom of the loop (to get back up to the top), but it makes no sense to jump back to the top, retest the conditional, and then jump ''back to the bottom of the loop'' if the conditional is found to be false. The while-loop then, performs the following steps:

#check the condition. if it is false, go to the end
#perform the loop body
#check the condition, if it is true, jump to 2.
#if the condition is not true, fall-through the end of the loop.

Here is a while-loop in C code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 while(x &lt;= 10)
 {
    x++;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

And here then is that same loop translated into assembly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov eax, $x
 cmp eax, 0x0A
 jg end
 beginning:
 inc eax
 cmp eax, 0x0A
 jle beginning
 end:
&lt;/source&gt;

If we were to translate that assembly code '''back into C''', we would get the following code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 if(x &lt;= 10) //remember: in If statements, we reverse the condition from the asm
 {
   do
   {
     x++;
   } while(x &lt;= 10)
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

See why we covered the Do-While loop first? Because the While-loop becomes a Do-While when it gets assembled.

So why can't the jump label occur before the test?
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov eax, $x
beginning:
cmp eax, 0x0A
jg end
inc eax
jmp beginning
end:
mov $x, eax
&lt;/source&gt;

== For Loops ==

What is a For-Loop? In essence, it's a While-Loop with an initial state, a condition, and an iterative instruction. For instance, the following generic For-Loop:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
| width=&quot;50%&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 for(initialization; condition; increment)
 {
   action
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
|[[Image:C language for.png|center]]
|}

gets translated into the following pseudocode while-loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 initialization;
 while(condition)
 {
   action;
   increment;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Which in turn gets translated into the following Do-While Loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 initialization;
 if(condition)
 {
    do
    {
       action;
       increment;
    } while(condition);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that often in for() loops you assign an initial constant value in A (for example x = 0), and then compare that value with another constant in B (for example x &lt; 10). Most optimizing compilers will be able to notice that the first time x IS less than 10, and therefore there is no need for the initial if(B) statement. In such cases, the compiler will simply generate the following sequence:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 initialization;
 do
 {
    action
    increment;
 } while(condition);
&lt;/source&gt;

rendering the code indistinguishable from a while() loop.

== Other Loop Types ==

C only has Do-While, While, and For Loops, but some other languages may very well implement their own types. Also, a good C-Programmer could easily &quot;home brew&quot; a new type of loop using a series of good macros, so they bear some consideration:

=== Do-Until Loop ===

A common Do-Until Loop will take the following form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 do
 {
   //loop body
 } until(x);
&lt;/source&gt;

which essentially becomes the following Do-While loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 do
 {
   //loop body
 } while(!x);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Until Loop ===

Like the Do-Until loop, the standard Until-Loop looks like the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 until(x)
 {
   //loop body
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

which (likewise) gets translated to the following While-Loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 while(!x)
 {
   //loop body
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Do-Forever Loop ===

A Do-Forever loop is simply an unqualified loop with a condition that is always true. For instance, the following pseudo-code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 doforever
 {
   //loop body
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

will become the following while-loop:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 while(1)
 {
   //loop body
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Which can actually be reduced to a simple unconditional jump statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 beginning:
 ;loop body
 jmp beginning
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that some non-optimizing compilers will produce nonsensical code for this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov ax, 1
 cmp ax, 1 
 jne loopend
 beginning:
 ;loop body
 cmp ax, 1
 je beginning
 loopend:
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that a lot of the comparisons here are not needed since the condition is a constant. Most compilers will optimize cases like this.</text>

== Code Obfuscation == 

'''Code Obfuscation''' is the act of making the assembly code or machine code of a program more difficult to disassemble or decompile. The term &quot;obfuscation&quot; is typically used to suggest a deliberate attempt to add difficulty, but many other practices will cause code to be obfuscated without that being the intention. Software vendors may attempt to obfuscate or even encrypt code to prevent reverse engineering efforts. There are many different types of obfuscations. Notice that many code optimizations (discussed in the previous chapter) have the side-effect of making code more difficult to read, and therefore optimizations act as obfuscations.

== What is Code Obfuscation? == 

There are many things that obfuscation could be: 

*Encrypted code that is decrypted prior to runtime.
*Compressed code that is decompressed prior to runtime.
*Executables that contain Encrypted sections, and a simple decrypter.
*Code instructions that are put in a hard-to read order.
*Code instructions which are used in a non-obvious way.

This chapter will try to examine some common methods of obfuscating code, but will not necessarily delve into methods to break the obfuscation.

== Interleaving ==

Optimizing Compilers will engage in a process called '''interleaving''' to try and maximize parallelism in pipelined processors. This technique is based on two premises: 

#That certain instructions can be executed out of order and still maintain the correct output
#That processors can perform certain pairs of tasks simultaneously.

=== x86 NetBurst Architecture ===

The Intel '''NetBurst Architecture''' divides an x86 processor into 2 distinct parts: the supporting hardware, and the primitive core processor. The primitive core of a processor contains the ability to perform some calculations blindingly fast, but not the instructions that you or I am familiar with. The processor first converts the code instructions into a form called &quot;micro-ops&quot; that are then handled by the primitive core processor.

The processor can also be broken down into 4 components, or modules, each of which is capable of performing certain tasks. Since each module can operate separately, up to 4 separate tasks can be handled ''simultaneously'' by the processor core, so long as those tasks can be performed by each of the 4 modules:

;Port0 : Double-speed integer arithmetic, floating point load, memory store

;Port1 : Double-speed integer arithmetic, floating point arithmetic

;Port2 : memory read

;Port3 : memory write (writes to address bus)

So for instance, the processor can simultaneously perform 2 integer arithmetic instructions in both Port0 and Port1, so a compiler will frequently go to great lengths to put arithmetic instructions close to each other. If the timing is just right, up to 4 arithmetic instructions can be executed in a single instruction period. 

Notice however that writing to memory is particularly slow (requiring the address to be sent by Port3, and the data itself to be written by Port0). Floating point numbers need to be loaded to the FPU before they can be operated on, so a floating point load and a floating point arithmetic instruction cannot operate on a single value in a single instruction cycle. Therefore, it is not uncommon to see floating point values loaded, integer values be manipulated, and then the floating point value be operated on.

== Non-Intuitive Instructions ==

Optimizing compilers frequently will use instructions that are not intuitive. Some instructions can perform tasks for which they were not designed, typically as a helpful side effect. Sometimes, one instruction can perform a task more quickly than other specialized instructions can.

The only way to know that one instruction is faster than another is to consult the processor documentation. However, knowing some of the most common substitutions is very useful to the reverser.

Here are some examples. The code in the first box operates more quickly than the one in the second, but performs exactly the same tasks.

'''Example 1'''

''Fast''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
xor eax, eax
&lt;/source&gt;

''Slow''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov eax, 0
&lt;/source&gt;


'''Example 2'''

''Fast''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
shl eax, 3
&lt;/source&gt;

''Slow''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
push 8
mul dword [esp]
add esp, 4
&lt;/source&gt;

Sometimes such transformations could be made to make the analysis more difficult:

'''Example 3'''

''Fast''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
push $next_instr
jmp $some_function
$next_instr:...
&lt;/source&gt;

''Slow''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
call $some_function
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Example 4'''

''Fast''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
pop eax
jmp eax
&lt;/source&gt;

''Slow''
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
retn
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Common Instruction Substitutions ===

;lea : The lea instruction has the following form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 lea dest, (XS:)[reg1 + reg2 * x] 
&lt;/source&gt;

Where XS is a segment register (SS, DS, CS, etc...), reg1 is the base address, reg2 is a variable offset, and x is a multiplicative scaling factor. What lea does, essentially, is load the memory address being pointed to in the second argument, into the first argument. Look at the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov eax, 1
 lea ecx, [eax + 4]
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, what is the value of ecx? The answer is that ecx has the value of (eax + 4), which is 5. In essence, lea is used to do addition and multiplication of a register and a constant that is a byte or less (-128 to +127). 

Now, consider:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov eax, 1
 lea ecx, [eax+eax*2]
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, ecx equals 3.

The difference is that lea is quick (because it only adds a register and a small constant), whereas the '''add''' and '''mul''' instructions are more versatile, but slower. lea is used for arithmetic in this fashion very frequently, even when compilers are not actively optimizing the code.

;xor : The xor instruction performs the bit-wise exclusive-or operation on two operands. Consider then, the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov al, 0xAA
 xor al, al
&lt;/source&gt;

What does this do? Lets take a look at the binary:

     10101010 ;10101010 = 0xAA
 xor 10101010
     --------
     00000000

The answer is that &quot;xor reg, reg&quot; sets the register to 0. More importantly, however, is that &quot;xor eax, eax&quot; sets eax to 0 ''faster'' (and the generated code instruction is smaller) than an equivalent &quot;mov eax, 0&quot;.

;mov edi, edi : On a 64-bit x86 system, this instruction clears the high 32-bits of the rdi register.

; shl, shr : left-shifting, in binary arithmetic, is equivalent to multiplying the operand by 2. Right-shifting is also equivalent to integer division by 2, although the lowest bit is dropped. in general, left-shifting by &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; spaces multiplies the operand by &lt;math&gt;2^N&lt;/math&gt;, and right shifting by &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; spaces is the same as dividing by &lt;math&gt;2^N&lt;/math&gt;. One important fact is that resulting number is an integer with no fractional part present. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 mov al, 31 ; 00011111
 shr al, 1  ; 00001111 = 15, not 15.5
&lt;/source&gt;

; xchg : xchg exchanges the contents of two registers, or a register and a memory address. A noteworthy point is the fact that xchg operates faster than a move instruction. For this reason, xchg will be used to move a value from a source to a destination, when the value in the source no longer needs to be saved. 

As an example, consider this code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mov ebx, eax
mov eax, 0
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the value in &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; is stored in &lt;code&gt;ebx&lt;/code&gt;, and then &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; is loaded with the value zero. We can perform the same operation, but using &lt;code&gt;xchg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;xor&lt;/code&gt; instead:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
xchg eax, ebx
xor eax, eax
&lt;/source&gt;

It may surprise you to learn that the second code example operates significantly faster than the first one does.

== Obfuscators ==

There are a number of tools on the market that will automate the process of code obfuscation. These products will use a number of transformations to turn a code snippet into a less-readable form, although it will not affect the program flow itself (although the transformations may increase code size or execution time).

== Code Transformations ==

Code transformations are a way of reordering code so that it performs exactly the same task but becomes more difficult to trace and disassemble. We can best demonstrate this technique by example. Let's say that we have 2 functions, FunctionA and FunctionB. Both of these two functions are comprised of 3 separate parts, which are performed in order. We can break this down as such:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 FunctionA()
 {
   FuncAPart1();
   FuncAPart2();
   FuncAPart3();
 }

 FunctionB()
 {
   FuncBPart1();
   FuncBPart2();
   FuncBPart3();
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

And we have our main program, that executes the two functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
 main()
 {
   FunctionA();
   FunctionB();
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, we can rearrange these snippets to a form that is much more complicated (in assembly):

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
 main: 
       jmp FAP1
 FBP3: call FuncBPart3
       jmp end
 FBP1: call FuncBPart1
       jmp FBP2
 FAP2: call FuncAPart2
       jmp FAP3
 FBP2: call FuncBPart2
       jmp FBP3
 FAP1: call FuncAPart1 
       jmp FAP2
 FAP3: call FuncAPart3
       jmp FBP1
 end:
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, this is much harder to read, although it perfectly preserves the program flow of the original code. This code is much harder for a human to read, although it isn't hard at all for an automated debugging tool (such as IDA Pro) to read.

== Opaque Predicates ==

An '''Opaque Predicate''' is a predicate inside the code, that cannot be evaluated during static analysis. This forces the attacker to perform a dynamic analysis to understand the result of the line. Typically this is related to a branch instruction that is used to prevent in static analysis the understanding which code path is taken.

== Code Encryption ==

Code can be encrypted, just like any other type of data, except that code can also work to encrypt and decrypt ''itself.'' Encrypted programs cannot be directly disassembled. However, such a program can also not be run directly because the encrypted opcodes cannot be interpreted properly by the CPU. For this reason, an encrypted program must contain some sort of method for decrypting itself prior to  operation.

The most basic method is to include a small stub program that decrypts the remainder of the executable, and then passes control to the decrypted routines.

=== Disassembling Encrypted Code ===

To disassemble an encrypted executable, you must first determine how the code is being decrypted. Code can be decrypted in one of two primary ways:
#All at once. The entire code portion is decrypted in a single pass, and left decrypted during execution. Using a debugger, allow the decryption routine to run completely, and then dump the decrypted code into a file for further analysis.
#By Block. The code is encrypted in separate blocks, where each block may have a separate encryption key. Blocks may be decrypted before use, and re-encrypted again after use. Using a debugger, you can attempt to capture all the decryption keys and then use those keys to decrypt the entire program at once later, or you can wait for the blocks to be decrypted, and then dump the blocks individually to a separate file for analysis.</text>

== Summary ==

The [[Ada Programming/Pragmas|pragma]] '''Suppress''' suppresses compiler-generated run-time checks. If a run-time check is disabled, an exception may be suppressed and undefined behavior could result. [[Ada Programming/Pragmas|pragma]] Suppress is used at the programmer's risk.

Checks that may be suppressed are:

* Access_Check - Check for dereference of a null access value. Constraint_Error suppressed.
* Accessibility_Check - Check for access of inaccessible object or subprogram. Program_Error suppressed.
* Discriminant_Check - Check for access of an unavailable component in a discriminant record (given the discriminant). Constraint_Error suppressed.
* Division_Check - Checks for divide by zero. Constraint_Error suppressed.
* Elaboration_Check - Checks for unelaborated package or subprogram body.  Program_Error suppressed.
* Index_Check - Check for out-of-range array index. Constraint_Error suppressed.
* Length_Check - Check for array length violation. Constraint_Error suppressed.
* Overflow_Check - Check for numeric overflow. Constraint_Error suppressed.
* Range_Check - Check of scalar variable for out-of-range values.  Constraint_Error suppressed.
* Storage_Check - Check for sufficient storage space to accommodate subprogram call. Storage_Error suppressed.
* Tag_Check - Checks for invalid object tag. Constraint_Error suppressed.
* All_Checks - All the above checks

== Example ==

 My_Array : Array ( 1 .. 100 ) of Integer;
 {{Ada/pragma|Suppress}}( Index_Check );
 ...
 Some_Variable := My_Array( 1000 ); {{Ada/--|Erroneous execution, here we come!}}

'''Milk toast''' is a [[Cookbook:Breakfast|breakfast]] food consisting of [[Cookbook:Toast|toasted]] [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] dipped in [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]].  Milk toast was a popular food throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century, especially for young children and for the ailing, for whom the food was thought to be soothing and easy to digest. Although not as popular today, milk toast is still considered a comfort food.

==Milk toast version I==
This recipe, though of common domain, is provided in the food writer M.F.K. Fisher's book '''''An Alphabet for Gourmets''''' under the title ''MILK TOAST for the Ill, Weak, Old, Very Young, or Weary''.

{{wikipedia|Milk toast}}

===Ingredients===
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] (570ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], part [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] if the person is not forbidden that
* 4 slices good [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* sweet [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], if butter is allowed
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]], if not a child or very ill

===Procedure===
Heat the milk to the simmering point. Meanwhile have ready 4 freshly toasted slices of bread. Butter them generously. Heat a pretty bowl, deeper than it is wide. Break the hot buttered toast into it, pour the steaming but not boiling milk over it, sprinkle a very little salt and pepper on the top, and serve at once.

==Milk toast version II==
This recipe comes from the 1918 edition of '''''The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book''''' by Fannie Farmer, a famous home-cooking author and instructor of the early 20th century.

===Ingredients===
* 1 pint (570ml) [[Cookbook:Scald|scalded]] milk
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] salt
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] butter
* 4 tablespoons cold water
* 2 ½ tablespoons bread [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 6 slices dry toast

===Procedure===
Add cold water gradually to flour to make a smooth, thin paste. Add to milk, stirring constantly until thickened, cover, and cook twenty minutes; then add salt and butter in small pieces. Dip slices of toast separately in sauce; when soft, remove to serving dish. Pour remaining sauce over all.

==Other tips==
Although both above recipes call for salt, milk toast may also be made sweet by the omission of salt and pepper and the addition, instead, of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]. Other optional ingredients for sweet versions include [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] or a touch of [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]], but piquant and exotic ingredients should be avoided, as the primary purpose of milk toast is to provide a food soothing to the palate and to the digestion. 

[[Corn starch]] may be substituted for flour.

{{Reverse Engineering Chapter}}

Apple Computer's '''Mac OS X''' is the standard Operating System used on Apple Macintosh computers. Other operating systems, primarily Linux, have been ported onto Mac Hardware, and there has been some effort to port OS X onto non-Mac Intel-based hardware, but neither of these efforts has attained the kind of popularity that the &quot;standard bundle&quot; has attained.

Mac OS X has been critically acclaimed by many people in the computer world as being both beautiful and easy to use. OS X is built on a BSD and Mach core but has a certain amount of software that is Mac-specific.

Try hard to keep this on the subject of general reverse engineering for Mac OS X, and not on 'cracking', or reversing only for security purposes. I have created special sections for these subjects, and all material focused on them should be kept there. Thanks! --[[User:Macpunk|Macpunk]] 04:17, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

== Hardware Architecture ==

Historically before OS X Macs ran the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macos Mac OS] operating system on the Motorola [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68000 68000] through the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68040 68040] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerpc PowerPC] the architectures. Steve Jobs would later leave Apple to create [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT NeXT]. After Apple had completed its hardware migration to the PowerPC platform it looked to a new kernel that could take advantage of this new hardware architecture. Many projects were started and failed and this and other factors led to the decline of Apple. In a move to capitalize on the new architecture it turned to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Inc. Be Inc.] to purchase its new [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beos BeOS], this would later fall through as Be Inc. wanted too much money. Apple then turned to NeXT and acquired not only the NeXT OS but Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs would quickly take control of Apple and place the NeXT architecture as the replacement for Apple's aging Mac OS. The replacement product was 1st known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhapsody_%28operating_system%29 Rhapsody] which had the older Mac OS feel to it. Steve Jobs felt the interface did not do it justice so his team of ex-NeXT engineers developed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_%28user_interface%29 Aqua] and Mac OS X was born.

Mac OS X [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.0 10.0 &quot;Cheetah&quot;] through [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.4 10.4.3 &quot;Tiger&quot;] would only run on the 4th and 5th generation of the PowerPC architecture. It became clear to Apple that IBM was having trouble with the 5th generation of the PowerPC known as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_G5 PowerPC G5] both in Development and Manufacturing. In addition IBM had yet to release a laptop version of the G5 process a year after it promised Apple it would. Apple then decided to migrate away from the PowerPC architecture and to an Intel based one. Apple chose the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_duo Intel 32-bit Core Duo] architecture. Apple's second generation of Intel products appeared less than a year later running the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core_2 Intel 64-bit Core 2 Duo] architecture.

Apple originally included a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module Trusted Platform Module] (TPM) to help curb pirating of Mac OS X. Later, Apple would turn to a simple AES encryption system where the encryption keys were stored in a kernel device driver. This led to the ability to decrypt and even encrypt Mac OS X executable binary files. The new TPM system is no longer present in any modern Mac. The new encryption system is only available to the Intel based Macs and yields all sorts of errors if attempted on the PowerPC platform.

Apple has committed to supporting both PowerPC and Intel platforms for the next few years. Every Mac OS X system today ships with its binary files in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_binary Universal binary] format which can be ran in both PowerPC and Intel based Macs. The Universal binary is simply the source files compiled multiple times, (once for each architecture), and then glued together afterwards. When the OS reads this universal binary it will then select the proper version of that compiled code and execute it. Since not all binary files are Universal, Apple released for the Intel platforms a software component called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_%28software%29 Rosetta] which would dynamically translate PowerPC system calls to Intel system calls allowing the PowerPC binary to be executed on an Intel Mac.

== Software Architecture ==

All builds of Mac OS X (OS X) are built on top of an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU XNU] kernel and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-o Mach-O] file format. The XNU kernel is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_kernel Hybrid] kernel. The kernel is divided into 4 sections.

==== Kernel Sections ====
# The Hardware Platform Expert
# The Mach 3.0 Subsystem (OSFMK)
# The BSD 4.4 Subsystem
# The IOKit Subsystem and Framework

While the traditional [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_%28kernel%29 Mach] kernel is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel Microkernel], Apple has instead implemented its variation of Mach 3.0 with a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel Monolithic] design. The Mach subsystem is only a partial implementation of the Mach 3.0 kernel that was designed by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University Carnegie Mellon University]. This partial implementation consists of the Mach Messaging system, Mach Virtual Memory System and Mach Process Manager.

The BSD 4.4 Subsystem is a micro implementation of the FreeBSD 4.x kernel. Over time Apple has been shrinking and reducing the feature set of this kernel subsystem in the hope to eliminate all but the essential pieces to run BSD source code software on the XNU kernel. Originally the subsystem had support for BSD device drivers, which could communicate directly to hardware. Unfortunately the device driver architecture in the BSD Subsystem is only able to support direct main memory access and to interface into the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usermode UserMode] part of a running process.

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOKit IOKit] Framework is a subset of the C++ programming language known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_C%2B%2B Embedded C++]. The IOKit Subsystem drives the components written in the IOKit Framework. IOKit's purpose is to unify and simplify the Driver architecture while maintaining some level of compatibility between major and minor OS releases. IOKit has generally been a resounding success as some other BSD operating systems have ported or implemented an IOKit like system to it, (such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DragonFly_BSD DragonFly BSD]).

The Hardware Platform Expert deals with the hardware differences of the PowerPC ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_G3 G3], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC_G4 G4] and G5), Intel 32-bit, Intel 64-bit, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon Intel Xeon 64-bit] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Pro Mac Pro] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xserve XServe]) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture ARM] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphone iPhone]) architectures.

== Commonly Used Tools ==

The common tools used to both compile/create the software and to disassemble/debug the software has been titled by Apple as the &quot;Developer Tools&quot;. The developer tools can be found both on the Installation DVD for Mac OS X 10.4 and higher as well as the [http://developer.apple.com/ Apple Developer Connection] (ADC) site. Joining ADC is free and is highly recommended. The ADC site has up to date documentation, tools and even sample source code. The ADC site should be your 1st place to do you research. A summary of the developer tools can be found at Apple's official [http://developer.apple.com/tools/ XCode And Tools] website. The tools common used on the Mac OS X platform for reverse engineering besides the developer documents are found in the list below.

==== Developer Tools Used ====
# [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/gdb.1.html gdb] ([http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/ GNU Debugger])
# [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/nm.1.html nm] (Object File Symbol Table Viewer)

== Reversing Basics ==

=== Architecture ===
Since most target binaries that you wish to reverse engineer on the Mac OS X platform are in the Mach-O Universal Binary format you should decide which target binary platform you wish to reverse engineer. To get a list of what formats a specific binary has you would call the &quot;file&quot; program. Example:

A common example using the file &quot;/bin/ls&quot;:
  $ file /bin/ls
  /bin/ls: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures
  /bin/ls (for architecture i386):	Mach-O executable i386
  /bin/ls (for architecture ppc7400):	Mach-O executable ppc

Another example, this time more of a rare one, using the file &quot;/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/ApplicationServices&quot;
  $ file /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/ApplicationServices
  /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/ApplicationServices: Mach-O universal binary with 4 architectures
  /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/ApplicationServices (for architecture ppc7400):	Mach-O dynamically linked shared library ppc
  /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/ApplicationServices (for architecture ppc64):	        Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library ppc64
  /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/ApplicationServices (for architecture i386):	        Mach-O dynamically linked shared library i386
  /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/ApplicationServices (for architecture x86_64):	Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64

=== Symbols ===
Once you have identified the architecture you wish to use as your base for reverse engineering you would then dump the symbol table. This can be handy for the future. Example:

Common symbol table dump from the i386 architecture:
  $ nm -arch i386 /bin/echo
           U ___error
  00001000 A __mh_execute_header
           U _exit
           U _malloc
           U _strerror$UNIX2003
           U _strlen
           U _write$UNIX2003
           U _writev$UNIX2003

The above symbols can be broken up into 2 major categories:

==== Symbol Types ====
# External
# Internal

There is a 3rd category of symbols which are called &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;stripped&quot; symbols. These symbols do not show up on ''nm'' and are hard to find out what they are doing and if they exist at all.&lt;br /&gt;
Each symbol type has a scope. The scope can either be private or public. In the past you could set the dynamic linker to a &quot;flat namespace&quot; which would convert the private symbols to public for your program only, however it has been reported that this functionality has been disabled on most libraries.&lt;br /&gt;
A private symbol is a symbol that is addressable by either the entire program or a section of the program only and can not be addressed by anyone else. A public symbol is one that is commonly known on other platforms as &quot;Exported&quot;. The public symbols can be accessed by anything that links to that binary either at compile time or runtime.

===== Internal Symbols =====
Internal symbols are symbols that are defined within the program and thus are not imported, (dynamically linked), during runtime. An internal symbol can however be an external symbol that was linked in at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile_time compile time] and the source of that symbol was an object file or a static library. You can identify an internal symbol quickly because the line with the symbol has a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal hexadecimal] number before the symbol type letter. External symbols have a blank space where the number should be. The number specified in the symbol table denotes at what offset in the file that symbol's code or data starts at. This value is relative and WILL be different at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime runtime]. One way a symbol is located in memory during runtime is to find the relative positions of 2 symbols on the disk, 1st being a well known symbol and the 2nd being an unknown one, then extract the difference. Once you have the difference you can find the 2nd symbol in memory by simply apply the difference to the 1st symbols address. Example:

====== Example ======
Find the 1st and 2nd symbols:
  $ nm /System/Library/Frameworks/QTKit.framework/QTKit
    /System/Library/Frameworks/QTKit.framework/QTKit(single module):
    {...}
    0005a638 T _copyBitmapRepToGWorld
    0008b017 t _createDisplayList
    {...}

In the above example our 1st symbol is &quot;_copyBitmapRepToGWorld&quot; which in a program is known as &quot;copyBitmapRepToGWorld&quot;. Our 2nd symbol is &quot;_createDisplayList&quot; which in a program is unknown since its a private symbol, (See private symbols). Once the function definition for the symbol &quot;_createDisplayList&quot; can be determined then it becomes important to define that symbol for your program's use. To do this lets assume that &quot;_createDisplayList&quot; C function prototype would be:

    void * createDisplayList(void);

The above prototype would be defined in the source code for the QTKit which is our target. That unfortunately doesn't help us since both the function prototype and the symbol name is unknown to our program. To resolve this problem we simple compute the difference from the above symbols, (the difference is 0x309DF), and define our function prototype as this:

    void * (* createDisplayList)(void);

Then you would assign that function its address by having another function, (such as main), execute this command before you use that function for the 1st time:

    createDisplayList = copyBitmapRepToGWorld + 0x309DF;

Some programs can get away with doing the above in 1 command outside of a function, I would NOT recommend this as the Mac OS X dynamic linker [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/dyld.1.html dyld] sometimes will change the value of the symbol address before you enter your main function but after the variable's initial values have been defined.

===== External Symbols =====
External symbols are symbols that are defined elsewhere like in a library, (see library below). To read an external symbol you simply strip the leading &quot;_&quot; off. If the symbol has a &quot;$&quot; in its name then everything past the 1st &quot;$&quot; is a hint to the dynamic linker that this symbol is an explicate external symbol and should be matched with that exact version of the symbol in the external library. An explicit symbol is very helpful for a program creator since it allows him/her to make it difficult to override the symbol or to have a runtime link mismatch error. The letter to the left of the symbol name, (in the above example &quot;U&quot;), denotes the type of symbol such as function or data structure.

=== PowerPC ===

Basic instructions include li (load immediate) and mr (move register).

==== The Stack ====

The PowerPC stack works exactly as any other stack would. It's a LIFO structure, and it grows downwards(towards lower memory addresses). The most important detail to remember when reversing PowerPC binaries is that the PowerPC chip has no built in implementation of a stack. There's no register designated to keep track of where the bottom of the stack is, and there's no instructions to push and pop data off of the stack. Everything is done via a general purpose register, and various arithmetic instructions.

The [[Ada Programming/Pragmas|pragma]] '''Inline''' specifies that a subprogram should be expanded inline when called in code.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|function}} My_Function {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/kw|return}} 1+2; {{Ada/--|A simple function suitable for inlining}}

== Summary ==

The [[Ada Programming/Pragmas|pragma]] '''Import''' directs the compiler to use code or data objects written in a foreign computer language.

Which foreign languages are supported depends on the compiler implementation. Typically [[C Programming|C]], [[C++ Programming|C++]], Cobol, and [[Fortran]] are supported.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/C/*|C file}}
 {{Ada/C/kw|int}} my_C_function() {
   {{Ada/C/kw|return}} 1;
 }

 {{Ada/--|Ada File}}
 {{Ada/kw|function}} My_C_Function {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer;
 {{Ada/pragma|Import}}
   (Convention    =&gt; C,
    Entity        =&gt; My_C_Function,
    External_Name =&gt; &quot;my_C_function&quot; );
 ...
 Some_Variable := My_C_Function; {{Ada/--|Ada uses a foreign language like a pro!}}

== Summary ==

The [[Ada Programming/Pragmas|pragma]] '''Export''' directs the compiler to make available subprograms or data objects written in Ada to foreign computer languages. If a subprogram is exported, it is compiled with conventions expected by the foreign language. For example, if a subprogram is being exported to C, record types declared in the subprogram are compiled the same as C-style structs.

The set of supported foreign languages depends on the compiler implementation. Typically [[C Programming|C]], [[C++ Programming|C++]], Cobol, and [[Fortran]] are supported.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/C/*|C file}}
 {{Ada/C/kw|int}} main() { 
   {{Ada/C/kw|int}} My_Int;  
   adainit();   
   {{Ada/C/*|Zoiks! C is using an Ada function!}}
   My_Int = My_Ada_Function();
   adafinal();
   {{Ada/C/kw|return}} 0;
 }

 {{Ada/--|Ada File}}
 {{Ada/kw|function}} My_Ada_Function {{Ada/kw|return}} Integer {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   {{Ada/kw|return}} 1;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} My_Ada_Function;

      <text xml:space="preserve">It seems a bit unfortunate that a wikipage on sport shooting leads to a section on military use of firearms.

readers looking to learn about target sport marksmanship could be misled into thinking that the shooting sports are only about learning to kill.

== Marksmanship - Military or Civilian the Theory's the Same. ==

Thats a very general statement to make, The majority of people looking up the priciples of Marksmanship would be military people. A lot of the Theory of Small arms Fire was developed by the Military and is mredundant to The Sports Target Shooter, You must remember that the Majority of Shooting done by the Military (well, outside the US Military anyway) is at 4' Targets (Speaking from Personal experience and I am a qualified Military Marksman)

This Article is a General one on Marksmanship, and as its in its Infancy its better to keep the Terms General rather than start a thread on Target Marksmanship, Hunting Marksmanship, or Military Marksmanship.

Regards.

==Integrating military and general marksmanship==

I have inserted a section called ''Fundamentals of Rifle Marksmanship''' even though they duplicate some of the original entry from the US Army manual.  I am leaving the duplicate sections for the moment, pending a Wikipedia editor's evaluation.  As a competition shooter of nearly 30 years experience (I've led a national championship team), I believe there is no difference between military and civilian techniques: shooters use whatever works best for them, and overlap is unavoidable.  

Similar sections should be inserted that specifically address handgun and shotgun marksmanship.  I feel qualified to comment upon on the former, less so on the latter.

There could also be a section briefly describing the various types of marksmanship events (bullseye, silhouette, action shooting, etc) but that decision should be left to our long-suffering editors.

[[User:68.2.139.236|68.2.139.236]] 23:25, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

I agree with the opening statement at the top 100% and it angers me that a book titled &quot;Marksmanship&quot; includes facsimiles of the human form as targets. Incuding being exceedingly distasteful, there are ethical, psychological and legal issues that make the use of the human form as a shooting target dangerous. 
To begin with those who oppose the non-military/non-police use of firearms can use this book as an argument against those who legally use firearms for other purposes therefore supporting their arguments. I am suspicious of the person who has published these targets in this book for that reason and the others you will find below. The purpose of using the human form as a target is to desensitize people to make it easier for them to shoot and possibly kill other humans. I have no intention of ever killing another human, so do not even like seeing a target of the human form. There have been court cases and legal precedents regarding practising shooting on targets representing the human form where premeditation of murder was proven based on this. A case could be make of premeditated murder or attempted murder if there was say, a shooting accident and the defendant had at some time practised shooting at a human form target. I once had a police officer attempt to gift me some human silhouette targets. He had a reputation of being shady.
I would like the original contributor to remove the human silhouette targets from the book and replace them with types of targets that were more traditionally used by marksmen or to use more inclusive terminology &quot;sharpshooters&quot;. Annie Oakley was definitely a fantastic shot as well as currently Dr. Susan Nattrass, to mention two shooters who are not &quot;men&quot;.

==Integerating Civlian and Military marksmanship==

* First off I am the orignal &quot;author&quot; (i.e. I started this wikibook).
* I am ex military and ex sport shooter (the law changes here in Australian sort of ruined my enjoyment and the practicality of sport shooting here, for me)
* I agree that the underlying of civil and military marksmanship are the same, e.g. position and hold, sight alignment, trigger manipulation etc.
* However I disagree with the sentiment that &quot;readers looking to learn about target sport marksmanship could be misled into thinking that the shooting sports are only about learning to kill.&quot;
** First off marksmanship does not only mean target sports marksman ship. It is equally applicable to shooting in the sport of hunting, shooting in the recreation of plinking, but also shooting in the context of military or law enforcement.
** An article about marksmanship generally (which is what this is hence the title &quot;Marksmanship&quot; as opposed to for example &quot;Miliatary Marksmanship&quot; or &quot;Civilian Marksmanship&quot; or &quot;Marksmanship for the &lt;insert discipline here&gt; shooter&quot; ) should cover all types of marksmanship, not just sports shooting, and if I recall corretly my oroginal contributions did not present any difference between different calsses of marksmanship. other than perhaps to include terms which are more widely used in a military context (which is not to say that they are not used or have no application in a civillian context, &quot;first catch&quot;, &quot;first graze&quot; are example.
** I am happy for people to replace diagrams which contain shaped or abstract human shapes with other shaped targets, however it strikes me as being a biut rude and a bit unreasonable to take them down and not replace them, as regardless of the shape of the targets, the content is relevant to a discussion of marksmanship overall.
** It should be born in mind that targets shaped as animals e.g. for metalic silhouette - night also be offensive or distasteful some people.
** I don't believe that just because something ''might'' be distasteful or even ''IS'' distasteful or ethically difficult for some people that it should not be included. There are lots of articles in wikipedia and probably lots of wikibooks that cover topics that are distasteful or ethically challenging for some people, for example religious topics. That is not reason to exclude them and I don;t think that because some individuals find the use of human or abstract human targets distasteful that they should be excluded.
** This is not an article on ethics or morality it is an article on marksmanship. IF you want to discuss the ethics or morals of shooting firearms, then a more appropriate place might be a book on that topic. This is a book on the practical and theoretical aspects of marksmanship
* I think that reference to particular disciplines in sport, civil or military shooting, e.g discussion of ISPC rules (which by the way is - or was -a civilian &quot;target sport&quot; which does use abstract human forms as targets, e.g. pepper poppers)) is probably out of place in a book about marksmanship, other than as asides and examples  for comparative purposes.
* I think if you want an article specifically on &quot;sport target&quot; shooting or a particular discipline in sport target shooting, such as ISU, sillouhette, or whatever that should create a separate book on that discipline. However a book on a given discipline was not intended in this book. This was intended to be a discussion of the theoretical and practical aspects of marksman ship.
* I see no legal issues in using human shaped targets in a book.
* I concede that there are potentially ethical issues. However some people would content that merely having a book on marksman ship is in itself an ethical issue. I have no intention of pandering to them.
* I do not recall any instance in my original contribution to killing or injuring people, (Other than the graphics in question - whcih I re-iterate I am happy for someone else to repalce with graphics which replace convey the same content with different shaped targets). 
* I don't agree that the majority of people looking for an article on marksmanship would be military. However I don't see that a s a reson to ignore the fact that the military has an interest in marksmanship and that some methods of marksmanship may be more militarily orentated than others (or indeed that some methods may be more civilian orientated). 
* I also don;t see why either civilian or military aspects of marksmanship should be ignored.
* I do understand the purpose of human shaped as targets in desensitizing people to the taboo of killing people, such as examined by Grossman, Marshall and others. However I think it is a very, very wide stretch of the imagination to think that using diagrams with human shaped targets in an article on marksmanship will desensitize a person sufficiently for them to find it easier or possible to shoot people. That type of conditioning requires more than the use viewing of pictures of targets that a human or abstract human in form. SO while I agree that the use of human/abstract human targets is a tool in desensitizing people to kill other people, I can not in my wildest imagination see that the inclusion of the diagrams I included would in anyway contribute to desensitizing a reader of the book/article, anymore than the inclusion a say a historical panting, a news photograph or a screen shot from a video game depicting killing people would contribute to desensitizing a person.
* I would however concede that actually suing human/abstract human target in marksmanship practice might a desensitizing effect under the right conditions. However I do no recall advocating the use of such targets in my earlier contributions.
* Again if you don't want human shaped targets in the diagrams, thats fine  - but please replace instead of simply deleting the diagrams supplied. I.e. ''contribute'' somthing yourself instead of just crticising/destorying someone else's contribution.
* I will say that I do think it is very naive though to think that it will make a difference to remove or replace human shaped targets, and I think it is rude and ignorant to assume that your moral and ethical beliefs are more important, more correct or should take precedence over mine.</text>

== What is '''Structural Engineering'''? ==
'''Structural engineering''' is a branch of engineering which deals with the analysis and design of various structural systems. Although this branch of engineering has influence on various other disciplines like mechanical or aeronautical engineering, etc., it is more commonly identified with civil engineering. Structural engineering deals with conception, design, and construction of the structural systems that are needed in support of human civil engineering

'''''&quot;Structural engineering is the art of molding materials we don't wholly understand, into shapes we can't fully analyze, so as to withstand forces we can't really assess, in such a way that the community at large has no reason to suspect the extent of our ignorance.&quot;'''''   ...James E. Amrhein - Masonry Institute of America (Retired)
[[User:LQEngineer|LQEngineer]] ([[User talk:LQEngineer|talk]]) 03:58, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

Engineers are the invisible presence that brings the architect or designer's concept into reality. In a broad sense, architects create the skin defining the usable flow of space that we live and work - occasionally appearing to defy gravity. The Engineer relies on the physical sciences to create a &quot;skeleton&quot; of interconnected elements that support the shell in the physical world. He or she uses the laws of physics (equilibrium) to design the structure (in part and in whole) to safely support the weight of the permanent building materials, changing movement of people, and short term applications of snow and water. These are defined as the vertical &quot;gravity&quot; loads (NOTE: Refer to topics related to; live, dead, and short-term loads) while resisting the &quot;horizontal&quot; forces of nature due to the worst case comparing; wind and seismic events that may act simualtaneously. Equilibrium is achieved by anchoring the structure to an adequate foundation based on the recommendations of a geotechnical (soils) engineer. Starting at the top and working down to the foundation, the engineer designs each element and the connections supporting the combination of elements to create the &quot;structure&quot; - a sum of its elements (whether a building, soil retaining wall or a bridge). The engineer follows building codes, enacted in state congress to create law that provides a minimum requirement to protect life safety. Working with different building materials (wood, steel, concrete, masonry and/or proprietary connectors and structural systems).

== Structural Engineering Activities ==
Structural engineering is mainly involved with two activities
:1. Structural Analysis
:2. Structural Design

== Structural Analysis ==
It deals with analyzing a particular structural system. A structural system may vary from simple systems (like beams, columns, slabs, etc.) to more complex systems (like frames, bridges, piers, foundations, retaining walls, etc.). The objective behind analysis is to estimate or find resultant stresses (or forces) so that these elements can be designed to withstand the load that comes over it.

=== Analysis of Statically Determinate Structures ===

==== Idealized Structures ====

In reality the exact analysis of a structure can never be carried out. Idealizing a structure is a method of conservatively simplifying the components of the structural system, while keeping its behavior under loading the same.  This is done in order to simplify calculations.  Without an idealized structure, design could take a massively longer amount of time... and sometimes becomes impossible. It is important for a structural engineer to develop methods to idealize a structure in order to carry out analysis.

===== Supports for Coplanar Structures =====

Structural Members are joined together by supports depending on the intent of the engineer. Three types of joints most often used are pin connections, roller supports, and fixed joints.  Pin connections provide vertical and lateral support, but cannot provide a moment reaction.  A roller support can only supply a reaction of a force in one direction.  A fixed joint provides vertical, lateral as well as a moment reaction.

=== Analysis of Statically Determinate Trusses ===

Typically done using method of joints, method of sections or graphical methods.

=== Internal Loadings Developed in Structural Members ===
Internal loadings are found by &quot;cutting&quot; the member and applying the equations of equilibrium to an isolated section.

=== Cables and Arches ===
What are Cables and Arches?

Cables are structural elements that can only withstand loads in tension. 

Arches are structural elements that withstand loads in compression.

=== Influence Lines for Statically Determinate Structures ===

Influence lines are a diagram that represents variation of a loading function at one location on a structure.  For example, a truck drives across a bridge:

When the truck is at the left side on top of the bridge, very little loading is felt at the right support.  The function represented by influence lines changes as the truck moves towards the right end of the bridge.  The loading at the right support grows as the truck nears it, until the truck reaches the far end, where the end realizes the maximum loading. Influence lines for statically determinate structures consist of a straight line.

=== Deflections ===

Deflections occur naturally in structures from various sources. Loads and temperature changes are sources of deflections that structural engineers have to design for because they are unavoidable. Designs must be made in order to avoid cracking of the materials used. Fabrication or Design Errors can lead to failure of structures and should be avoided through careful planning and analysis.

Structures in most cases are built with materials that can withstand the designed loading and only have a linear elastic response. Under these conditions loads may cause deflections, but when the load is removed the structure will return to it original shape and strength. Overloading beyond the linear elastic response may cause damage and failure of the structure.  This is referred to as &quot;plastic deformation&quot;.

==== Elastic-Beam Theory ====

If a material is homogeneous and behaves in a linear elastic manner we can derive a nonlinear second order differential equation that when solved through the double integration method can give a solution deflection as a function of x. We must assume &lt;math&gt;dv/dx =0&lt;/math&gt; relative to the length of the beam in the x-axial direction.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = \frac{M}{EI}&lt;/math&gt;

M = the internal moment in the beam
E = the material's modulus of elasticity
I = the beam's moment of inertia computed about the neutral axis
v = deflection of beam

==== The Double Integration Method ====

When Moment can be expressed as a function of position x, then performing single integration will yield the beam's slope as a function of x, and the equation of the elastic curve. Performing double integration will yield the beam's deflection for any position of x 

The two integrations will yield two constants of integration. Using the boundary conditions the constants can be solved for.

====  Castigliano's theorems ====

===First theorem===
:''If the strain energy of an elastic structure can be expressed as a function of generalized displacement qi; then the partial derivative of the strain energy with respect to generalized displacement gives the generalized force Qi.''

Using this theorem the generalized forces acting on the structure can be calculated.

===Second theorem===
:''If the strain energy of a linearly elastic structure can be expressed as a function of generalized force Qi; then the partial derivative of the strain energy with respect to generalized force gives the generalized displacement qi in the direction of Qi.''

Using this theorem the generalized displacement of the structure can be calculated.  '''Castigliano's method''' usually refers to the application of his second theorem.

== Structural Design ==
Structural design is the process of selecting members of required dimensions such that they provide adequate stability under service loads. There are two conditions that a structural designer must keep in mind. One is &quot;stability&quot; and the other is &quot;serviceability&quot;. Stability of a structure means that it can resist the loads acting on it satisfactorily and that the structure will not collapse immediately (that is, it provides enough time to escape to safety). Serviceability refers to certain conditions that are required so that the structure remains serviceable. For example, consider a bridge that can resist service loads without collapse. This is a &quot;stable&quot; structure. Now assume that this bridge shows abnormal deflections. The deflections could be such that the bridge feels bouncy and could lead to steering problems for vehicles crossing it at high speeds. As such this may not cause the structure to collapse. So we can say that the structure is stable, but according to serviceability criterion it is not serviceable because people could feel afraid of using the bridge.

In the design and construction of the foundation and framing for buildings and bridges, the main materials used are concrete, steel, timber, and masonry. Steel can further be subdivided into two subsections: hot-rolled steel and cold-formed steel. Cold-formed steel applies to material of approximately 1/8&quot; or less in thickness that is either folded or roll-formed from flat sheets into structural shapes while at room temperature.

== Safety Factors ==
All structures must be designed to carry all foreseeable loads with a suitable factor of safety.  Clearly it would be unsafe to walk on a structure that was adequate but had no margin of safety built in. With this in mind, most countries have standards that prescribe the required minimum safety factors for structures. The minimum is usually a factor of about 1.7. This is not a factor to allow for overloading or poor workmanship. If there is a possibility of overloading or poor workmanship, the design loads must be increased to account for the overloading and the strengths of the materials upon which the design is based must be reduced to account for the poor workmanship. The safety factor must remain complete, as it is there to account for the unexpected events and unforeseen circumstances. If a structure becomes worn, loose, cracked or corroded, it should always be repaired so the safety factor is preserved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We can bump this page up to 50% completed if we can list a few Linux debuggers. beyond that, we should probably include some screenshots, and some tips on effective debugging (perhaps even make a distinction between live analysis and dead listing). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 03:54, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

I think some of the Linux-debuggers here are not &quot;debuggers&quot; per se at all. Some of them should probably be moved to the &quot;other tools&quot; section, but i dont know this for a fact. --[[User:129.32.61.137|129.32.61.137]] 13:47, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

:Can you define what a &quot;debugger&quot; is? I can use those tools for debugging; therefore they are debuggers. :-) The page isn't called &quot;traditional debuggers&quot; or &quot;interactive debuggers&quot; or &quot;GUI debuggers&quot;. Weird scriptable tools can be very powerful. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 14:16, 20 September 2005 (UTC)
::Good point, but some of the tools, specifically readelf or objdump fit better into the section on &quot;Other tools&quot;, as a counterpoint to the windows dumpbin utility already listed there. I've been defining debugger as a program that allows single-stepping, breakpoints, and analysis. Tools not specifically used in this manner have been moved to the &quot;Other tools&quot; section. It is important to focus on few issues per chapter, to prevent confusing the reader. If the book says that every reader should have &quot;at least one debugger&quot; when reading this book, it would probably be counterproductive if the reader only downloads Lizard or ReadELF, because those dont do the job that &quot;debuggers&quot; do in this book.--Whiteknight
:::I think Lizard does single-stepping... in both directions! [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:01, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would like to contribute to a basic, first college semester electrical engineering text, but I am confused about which category would be appropriate to write under: electrical engineering, electronic engineering, or the physics electronics section, which seems to hold information I would consider appropriate to electrical engineering. How should we delineate these categories?

Thanks much,

== Electrical Engineering ==

I have written up a general outline of a few EE books on [[User:Whiteknight|my user page]], and would like to get some feedback about them. I've started books on Circuit Theory and Digital Circuits, which will form an introductory base for the rest of the books. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 14:24, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

== Electrical Engineering and Electronic engineering ==

I was wondering if we could merge the titles of electrical and electronic engineering, they are both the same exact subject. Another engineering topic 'Computer engineering' is the same as electrical but focuses more on digital logic and programable controllers. so would it be possible to merge electronic and electrical and then rename it to Electrical/Computer engineering? --[[User:Asm2750|Asm2750]] 19.37, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

:I merged the two sections, and included a note. I did not, however, rename the section &quot;Electrical/Computer Engineering&quot;. Such a change would break alot of links, I think. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:41, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

I would like to add my opinion(s) to this discussion about electrical/electronic engineering. In particular, I do not believe (as Asm2750 asserts) they are &quot;the same exact subject&quot;.

Electrical engineering is concerned with the provision (generation, transmission, distribution, etc.) of electricity. Electronics engineering is concerned with the manipulation of the electrical supply in more complex processes (&quot;electron&quot; ics, related to the behaviour of electrons). Electronics is more concerned with the manipulation and study of the flow of charge within a circuit.

I am an Electronic Technologist. To distinguish my specialty from that of the electrician, I often tell people &quot;The Electrician is the person who provides the power. The Electronics Technician (or Technologist, or Engineer, etc.) is the person who makes it get up and dance.

If you will check &quot;Electrical Engineering&quot; in Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering 
you will find opinions similar to those I have just stated. Thank You.

==Books to be moved==
I think the text in [[Theoretical Mechanics]] is more aproriate here instead of the [[Wikibooks:Physics bookshelf|Physics Bookshelf]] --[[User:msmithma|Mart!n]]

I moved Basic Electricity in Physics to Basic Electrical Generation and Distribution, and it should be removed from the Physics bookshelf and placed on the Electrical Engineering shelf. My first contribution over on wikibooks, so I'm not sure of the protocol. I know right now it is a redirect from Basic Electricity, but I don't want to sever that as there are a dozen or so links.

[[User:Jtvisona|Jtvisona]] 02:47, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

Both materials science texts need to be moved out of civil engineering and, most appropriatly, placed under a new heading called materials science.[[User:SmoJoe|SmoJoe]] ([[User talk:SmoJoe|talk]]) 18:05, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Error handling techniques ==

This chapter describes various error handling techniques. First the technique is described, then its use is shown with an example function and a call to that function. We use the &amp;radic; function which should report an error condition when called with a negative parameter.

To be specific: Exceptions is the Ada way to go.

=== Return code ===

{{Ada/Sourceforge|error_handling_1.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Error_Handling_1 {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Square_Root (X : {{Ada/kw|in}} Float) {{Ada/kw|return}} Float {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Numerics.Elementary_Functions;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|if}} X &lt; 0.0 {{Ada/kw|then}}
         {{Ada/kw|return}} -1.0;
      {{Ada/kw|else}}
         {{Ada/kw|return}} Sqrt (X);
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Square_Root;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   C := Square_Root (A ** 2 + B ** 2);
 
   {{Ada/kw|if}} C &lt; 0.0 {{Ada/kw|then}}
      T_IO.Put (&quot;C cannot be calculated!&quot;);
   {{Ada/kw|else}}
      T_IO.Put (&quot;C is &quot;);
      F_IO.Put
        (Item =&gt; C,
         Fore =&gt; F_IO.Default_Fore,
         Aft  =&gt; F_IO.Default_Aft,
         Exp  =&gt; F_IO.Default_Exp);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Error_Handling_1;

Our example makes use of the fact that all valid return values for &amp;radic; are positive and therefore -1 can be used as an error indicator. However this technique won't work when all possible return values are valid and no return value is available as error indicator; hence to use this method is a very bad idea.

=== Error (success) indicator parameter ===

An error condition is returned via additional ''out'' parameter. Traditionally the indicator is either a boolean with &quot;true = success&quot; or an enumeration with the first element being &quot;Ok&quot; and other elements indicating various error conditions.

{{Ada/Sourceforge|error_handling_2.adb}}
  
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Error_Handling_2 {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
  {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Square_Root
     (Y       : {{Ada/kw|out}} Float;
      X       : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Float;
      Success : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean)
   {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Numerics.Elementary_Functions;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|if}} X &lt; 0.0 {{Ada/kw|then}}
         Y       := 0.0;
         Success := False;
      {{Ada/kw|else}}
         Y       := Sqrt (X);
         Success := True;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
      {{Ada/kw|return}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Square_Root;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   Square_Root
     (Y       =&gt; C,
      X       =&gt; A ** 2 + B ** 2,
      Success =&gt; Success);
 
   {{Ada/kw|if}} Success {{Ada/kw|then}}
      T_IO.Put (&quot;C is &quot;);
      F_IO.Put (Item =&gt; C);
   {{Ada/kw|else}}
      T_IO.Put (&quot;C cannot be calculated!&quot;);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Error_Handling_2;

One restriction for Ada up to Ada 2005 is that functions cannot have out parameters. (Functions can have any side effects but may not show them). So for our example we had to use a procedure instead. The bad news is that the Success parameter value can easily be ignored.

In Ada 2012, functions may have parameters of any mode; hence this is possible at last:

  {{Ada/kw|function}} Square_Root
     (X       : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Float;
      Success : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean) {{Ada/kw|return}} Float
   {{Ada/kw|is}}
     ...

This technique does not look very nice in mathematical calculations; hence no good idea either.

=== Global variable ===

An error condition is stored inside a global variable. This variable is then read directly or indirectly via a function.

{{Ada/Sourceforge|error_handling_3.adb}}

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Error_Handling_3 {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   Float_Error : Boolean;
 
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Square_Root (X : {{Ada/kw|in}} Float) {{Ada/kw|return}} Float
   {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Numerics.Elementary_Functions;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|if}} X &lt; 0.0 {{Ada/kw|then}}
         Float_Error := True;
         {{Ada/kw|return}} 0.0;
      {{Ada/kw|else}}
         {{Ada/kw|return}} Sqrt (X);
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Square_Root;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   Float_Error := False;  -- reset the indicator before use
   C := Square_Root (A ** 2 + B ** 2);
 
   {{Ada/kw|if}} Float_Error {{Ada/kw|then}}
      T_IO.Put (&quot;C cannot be calculated!&quot;);
   {{Ada/kw|else}}
      T_IO.Put (&quot;C is &quot;);
      F_IO.Put
        (Item =&gt; C,
         Fore =&gt; F_IO.Default_Fore,
         Aft  =&gt; F_IO.Default_Aft,
         Exp  =&gt; F_IO.Default_Exp);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Error_Handling_3;

As you can see from the source, the problematic part of this technique is choosing the place at which the flag is reset. You could either have the callee or the caller do that.

Also this technique is not suitable for multithreading.

Use of global variables for cases like this indeed is a very bad idea, in effect one of the worst.

=== Exceptions ===

Ada supports a form of error handling that has long been used by other languages like the classic &lt;code&gt;ON ERROR GOTO ...&lt;/code&gt; from early Basic dialects to the &lt;code&gt;try ... catch&lt;/code&gt; exception handling from modern object oriented languages.

The idea is: You register some part of your program as error handler to be called whenever an error happens. You can even define more than one handler to handle different kinds of errors separately. Once an error occurs, the execution jumps to the error handler and continues there; it is impossible to return to the location where the error occurred.

This is the Ada way!

{{Ada/Sourceforge|error_handling_4.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Error_Handling_4 {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   Root_Error: {{Ada/kw|exception}};
 
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Square_Root (X : {{Ada/kw|in}} Float) {{Ada/kw|return}} Float {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Numerics.Elementary_Functions;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|if}} X &lt; 0.0 {{Ada/kw|then}}
         {{Ada/kw|raise}} Root_Error;
      {{Ada/kw|else}}
         {{Ada/kw|return}} Sqrt (X);
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Square_Root;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
    C := Square_Root (A ** 2 + B ** 2);
 
    T_IO.Put (&quot;C is &quot;);
    F_IO.Put
        (Item =&gt; C,
         Fore =&gt; F_IO.Default_Fore,
         Aft  =&gt; F_IO.Default_Aft,
         Exp  =&gt; F_IO.Default_Exp);
 {{Ada/kw|exception}}
    {{Ada/kw|when}} Root_Error =&gt;
       T_IO.Put (&quot;C cannot be calculated!&quot;);
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Error_Handling_4;

The great strength of exceptions handling is that it can block several operations within one exception handler. This eases the burden of error handling since not every function or procedure call needs to be checked independently for successful execution.

=== Design by contract ===

In Design by Contract (DbC), operations must be called with the correct parameters. This is the caller's part of the contract. If the subtypes of the actual arguments match the subtypes of the formal arguments, and if the actual arguments have values that make the function's preconditions True, then the subprogram gets a chance to fulfill its postcondition. Otherwise an error condition occurs.

Now you might wonder how that is going to work. Let's look at the example first:

{{Ada/Sourceforge|error_handling_5.adb}}

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Error_Handling_5 {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
   {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Square_Root_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} Float {{Ada/kw|range}} 0.0 .. Float'{{Ada/attribute|Last}};
  
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Square_Root
     (X    : {{Ada/kw|in}} Square_Root_Type)
      {{Ada/kw|return}} Square_Root_Type
   {{Ada/kw|is}}
      {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Numerics.Elementary_Functions;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|return}} Sqrt (X);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Square_Root;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
 
   C := Square_Root (A ** 2 + B ** 2);
 
   T_IO.Put (&quot;C is &quot;);
   F_IO.Put
     (Item =&gt; C,
      Fore =&gt; F_IO.Default_Fore,
      Aft  =&gt; F_IO.Default_Aft,
      Exp  =&gt; F_IO.Default_Exp);
 
   {{Ada/kw|return}};
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Error_Handling_5;

As you can see, the function requires a precondition of &lt;code&gt;X &gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; that is, the function can only be called when &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; &amp;ge; 0. In return the function promises as postcondition that the return value is also &amp;ge; 0.

In a full DbC approach, the postcondition will state a relation that fully describes the value that results when running the function, something like &lt;code&gt;result &amp;ge; 0 and X = result * result&lt;/code&gt;. This postcondition is √'s part of the contract. The use of assertions, annotations, or a language's type system for expressing the precondition &lt;code&gt;X &gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt; exhibits two important aspects of Design by Contract:

# There can be ways for the compiler, or analysis tool, to help check the contracts. (Here for example, this is the case when &lt;code&gt;X &amp;ge; 0&lt;/code&gt; follows from X's subtype, and √'s argument when called is of the same subtype, hence also &amp;ge; 0.)
# The precondition can be mechanically checked '''before''' the function is called.

The 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; aspect adds to safety: No programmer is perfect. Each part of the contract that needs to be checked by the programmers themselves has a high probability for mistakes.

The 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; aspect is important for optimization &amp;mdash; when the contract can be checked at compile time, no runtime check is needed. You might not have noticed but if you think about it: &lt;math&gt;A^2 + B^2&lt;/math&gt; is never negative, ''provided'' the exponentiation operator and the addition operator work in the usual way. 

We have made 5 nice error handling examples for a piece of code which never fails. And this is the great opportunity for controlling some runtime aspects of DbC: You can now safely turn checks off, and the code optimizer can omit the actual range checks.

DbC languages distinguish themselves on how they act in the face of a contract breach:

# True DbC programming languages combine DbC with exception handling &amp;mdash; raising an exception when a contract breach is detected at runtime, and providing the means to restart the failing routine or block in a known good state.
# Static analysis tools check all contracts at analysis time and demand that the code written in such a way that no contract can ever be breached at runtime.

Ada 2012 has introduced pre- and postcondition aspects.

The '''super''' keyword can be used to call a method of the same name in the superclass of the class making the call.  Values passed to the super call are passed into the parent method.

    end
  end

A call to the &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; function of the child class above will result in the execution of both its body and the body of the &lt;code&gt;initialize&lt;/code&gt; function in the parent class. 

Note that if you invoke ''super'' without arguments, all arguments to executing method will be passed to the parent method as well - and if parent's signature does not match the number of arguments, an exception will be raised. So, if the child version of the method uses a different number of arguments than the version in superclass, you need to list arguments that you want to pass to the parent's version of the method.

Note also that you can use any method name, not just initialize (in this case).

= iterators =
'''Iterators''' provide a method for cycling through a set of values and performing an operation, usually specified by a code block, for each value.  Iterator functionality is often provided through the ''mixin'' &lt;code&gt;Enumeration&lt;/code&gt; module.  

The first iterator that Ruby programmers are likely to encounter is the &lt;code&gt;each&lt;/code&gt; iterator.

Example:
  arr = [1,2,3]
  arr.each do |number|
    put number
  end

Outputs:
  1
  2
  3

= yield =

&lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; executes the entire code block passed to the method.

Example:

  def do3times
    yield
    yield
    yield
  end
  
  do3times { puts &quot;yielding...&quot; }

Outputs:

  yielding...
  yielding...
  yielding...


You can therefore make your own method looking like the built-in &lt;code&gt;times&lt;/code&gt;:

  class Fixnum
    def times_plus1
      i = 1
      while i &lt;= self + 1
        i += 1
        yield
      end
    end
  end


  5.times_plus1 { puts &quot;yielding...&quot; }

Outputs:

  yielding...
  yielding...
  yielding...
  yielding...
  yielding...
  yielding...

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
Now that the excitement of having something actually work has worn off we can take a critical look at what we have done.

What have we done?  We have shown that:

*we can 'create' an editor that lets us format text with text attributes such as bold face, italic, etc.
*we can execute the text and put the result back in the text.

Sounds good but the list of things we haven't done and haven't considered is much longer.  Here are some of the obvious entries:

*What about text that is not part of a formula,
*Where should the results go?  Surely not at the bottom of the page.
*Didn't we mention charts in our wish list?
*There is a lot more to formatting than bold,italic and underline.
*What is supposed to happen when the user writes something that the program doesn't understand?

In order to make some visible progress it is often a good idea to tackle the easy problems first, at least if they are problems that must be solved and not just vague wishes.  The problem is of course that we don't know which problems are easiest to solve without examining them.  Sometimes examining the problem just turns up more problems, sometimes it will turn out to not really be a problem at all.

Lets take our not done items in turn.

=Text that is not part of a formula=
Our prototype works by passing the whole text of the document to the Script object.  This means that the whole text must be legal in the language of the script engine.  Our formulas are just statements in that language.  Programs are composed of three types of things:

*statements
*comments
*whitespace

So the text that is not part of a formula is by definition either whitespace or comments.  If it contains any printable characters then it can't be whitespace so it must be comments.  So, we can include any text we like so long as it can be contained in comments because the scripting engine will just treat it as whitespace and ignore it.

There are several different syntaxes for comments, sometimes one language will allow more than one type.  When using the language purely for programming it usually doesn't matter very much how comments are delineated but in our case the coments will be a very important part of the text so it is important that the syntax doesn't get in the way.  We have already decided to limit ourselves to either VBScript or JScript so all we have to do is decide which has the better syntax for comments, while bearing in mind that we might want to change our mind later for other reasons.

The syntax for comments in VBScript is very simple, it is the same as Visual Basic.  A comment is introduced by a single ASCII quotation mark:

  ' this is a comment

or the word REM (case doesn't matter):

  rem this line
  ReM and this line are both comments

JScript is a little different:

  // this is a single line comment

  /* this is also a single line comment */

but:

  /* This
     is
     a 
     multiline
     comment */

For our purposes I think it is obvious that the JScript syntax is more convenient for writing paragraphs of text.  If we use JScript then we can simply write our text and formulas quite naturally except for remembering to enclose the blocks of text in ''/*..*/''.  Best of all we don't have to do any extra programming to make this work.

==Exercises==
*Run the program and add comments using the two different comment styles.  Run the document to convince yourself that the comments do not affect the result.

=Where should the output go?=
So far the output has simply been appended to the end of the document.  This is obviously not very useful.  We probably want to be able to put the answers near the questions, values near the formulas that determine them.

Also we don't want repeated evaluations to add new copies of the values to the end of the document.  One way around this is to place some special sequence of characters in the text that will be replaced by the answers.  For instance we could write a document that looks something like this:


  Ttop=55 // deg C
  Tbot=Ttop-6
  
  /*
  The bottom temperature is &lt;Tbot&gt;. Which is six degrees below the top.
  */

The first line sets variable ''Ttop'' to 55, the next calculates the value of ''Tbot''.  Then we have a multiline comment that has embedded in it the character sequence ''&lt;Tbot&gt;''; this is called a ''macro''.

Now we can execute the program which will set the values of the variables and then we can scan the program text looking for ''macros''.  When we find a macro we can ask the Script object for the value of the variable it names and replace the macro with the value.

It is easy to find the ''macros'', just a few ''InStr'' calls will do it or we can get more sophisticated and use ''regular expressions''.  After evaluation and macro substitution the document would look like this:

  Ttop=55 // deg C
  Tbot=Ttop-6
  
  /*
  The bottom temperature is 49. Which is six degrees below the top.
  */



Unfortunately there is a serious flaw in this scheme: it only works the first time we evaluate the document.  This is because we have ''replaced'' the ''macro'' with the value just as though we were running a normal macro-processor; see, for example, [http://publib16.boulder.ibm.com/pseries/en_US/aixprggd/genprogc/m4macro.htm m4 Macro Processor Overview].  If we modify the document to change the constant ''6'' to ''9'' and re-evaluate the document the result will not change.

In our case the input document is also the output document so we have to insert the output in such a way that it can be re-evaluated and have the results updated.

One solution is to modify the method by which we show the result so that the macro is not replaced but is instead modified.  Then the document might look like this after evaluation:


  Ttop=55 // deg C
  Tbot=Ttop-6
  
  /*
  The bottom temperature is &lt;Tbot=49&gt;. Which is six degrees below the top.
  */

Now we just have to make some simple modifications to the code, as yet unwritten, that scans the text for the macros and to the code that inserts the result.  All that is required is that we recognize the macro and split it into two parts: ''name'' and '' value''.  The name and the characters that are used to indicate that this is a macro are left unchanged while the value is replaced.  When you write the document you would write the macro like this:

  &lt;Tbot=&gt;

That is, the value is empty and will be filled in when the value is known.



==Exercises==
*Try to think of a general procedure for replacing the placeholders with the values of the variables.
*What will happen if the same variable has different values in different parts of the document?  What should happen?

=Charts and other objects=
Understanding that there are different ways of viewing the same thing ''and'' that different things can be viewed in the same way is one of the most important lessons to be learnt in computer programming.

If we regard charts as simply another kind of value all questions regarding the generation and inclusion of charts become questions about what kind of function has to be written to generate the value and how to automatically insert that value in the document.  Once the problem is phrased in this way it becomes obvious that we can use the same macro technique to display a chart that we use to display a number.  now all we have to do is create a function that creates a chart.

Of course there are lots of details to be dealt with yet.  Still if we simply assume that there is a function somewhere that creates charts, perhaps as bitmap images, all we have to do is find a way of calling it.

=Formatting=
In principle we can use any formatting that is supported by the Rich Text Box control.  we should be able to provide hot keys, menus and toolbar buttons to set the type face, type size, indentation, justification and so on.

=Syntax errors, typing mistakes, etc=
To do.

==Exercises==
*Create a new project with a Rich text Box control.  Experiment with the properties and methods of the control to set type faces, sizes, indentation, etc.  Create a button for each feature.
*Extend the application to let the user pick the type face, etc., by showing the font selection dialog box.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Error handling techniques ==

This chapter describes various error handling techniques. First the technique is described, then its use is shown with an example function and a call to that function. We use the &amp;radic; function which should report an error condition when called with a negative parameter.

=== Return code ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Our example make use of the fact that all valid return values for &amp;radic; are positive and therefore -1 can be used as an error indicator. However this technique won't work when all possible return values are valid and no return value is available as error indicator.

=== Error (success) indicator parameter ===

An error condition is returned via additional ''out'' parameter. Traditionally the indicator is either a boolean with &quot;true = success&quot; or an enumeration with the first element being &quot;Ok&quot; and other elements indicating various error conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This technique does not look very nice in mathematical calculations. 

=== Global variable ===

An error condition is stored inside a global variable. This variable is then read directly or indirectly via a function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As you can see from the source the problematic part of this technique is choosing the place at which the flag is reset. You could either have the callee or the caller do that.

Also this technique is not suitable for multithreading.

=== Exceptions ===

The programming language supports some form of error handling. This ranges from the classic &lt;code&gt;ON ERROR GOTO ...&lt;/code&gt; from early Basic dialects to the &lt;code&gt;try ... catch&lt;/code&gt; exceptions handling from modern object oriented languages.

The idea is always the same: you register some part of your program as error handler to be called whenever an error happens. Modern designs allow you to define more than one handler to handle different types of errors separately.

Once an error occurs the execution jumps to the error handler and continues there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As you see the function demands a precondition of &lt;code&gt;X &gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt; - that is the function can only be called when &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; &amp;ge; 0. In return the function promises as postcondition that the return value is also &amp;ge; 0.

In a full DbC approach, the postcondition will state a relation that fully describes the value that results when running the function, something like &lt;code&gt;result &amp;ge; 0 and X = result * result&lt;/code&gt;. This postcondition is √'s part of the contract. The use of assertions, annotations, or a language's type system for expressing the precondition &lt;code&gt;X &gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt; exhibits two important aspects of Design by Contract:

# There can be ways for the compiler, or analysis tool, to help check the contracts.  (Here for example, this is the case when &lt;code&gt;X &amp;ge; 0&lt;/code&gt; follows from X's type, and √'s argument when called is of the same type, hence also &amp;ge; 0.)
# The precondition can be mechanically checked '''before''' the function is called.

The 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; aspect adds to safety: No programmer is perfect. Each part of the contract that needs to be checked by the programmers themselves has a high probability for mistakes.

The 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; aspect is important for optimization &amp;mdash; when the contract can be checked at compile time, no runtime check is needed. You might not have noticed but if you think about it: &lt;math&gt;A^2 + B^2&lt;/math&gt; is never negative, ''provided'' the exponentiation operator and the addition operator work in the usual way. 

We have made 5 nice error handling examples for a piece of code which never fails. And this is the great opportunity for controlling some runtime aspects of DbC: You can now safely turn checks off, and the code optimizer can omit the actual range checks.

DbC languages distinguish themselves on how they act in the face of a contract breach:

# True DbC programming languages combine DbC with exception handling &amp;mdash; raising an exception when a contract breach is detected at runtime, and providing the means to restart the failing routine or block in a known good state.
# Static analysis tools check all contracts at analysis time and demand that the code written in such a way that no contract can ever be breached at runtime.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The great strength of exceptions handling is that it can block several operations  within one exception handler. This eases up the burden of error handling since not every function or procedure call needs to be checked independently for successful execution.

=== Design by Contract ===

In [[Computer Programming/Design by Contract|Design by Contract]] (DbC) functions must be called with the correct parameters. This is the caller's part of the contract. If the types of actual arguments match the types of formal arguments, and if the actual arguments have values that make the function's preconditions True, then the subprogram gets a chance to fulfill its postcondition.  Otherwise an error condition occurs.
Now you might wonder how that is going to work. Let's look at the example first:

=Why build your own computer?=

It's cheaper to build your own workstation than to buy one off the shelf.  While this might not be true for low-end computers, we're building a decent workstation.  Many computer manufacturers make their profit from &quot;workstation&quot; class computers.  If you build your own computer and put your research in, you can build a fast, stable and efficient machine for maybe 30% less than a similarly spec'd off-the-shelf system.  An important note to make is that while you can build a custom Windows PC, you cannot build a custom Apple system: Apple's software is only available on machines they build.  However, this has not stopped Final Cut Pro from being a preferred editing solution.  The Mac Pro offers a large variety of build-to-order options, and ranges in price from $2000 - $20 000, depending on processors, hard drive space, RAM, and video cards.

=Software=

Generally it works best to pick out the software first, and then get whatever hardware is necessary to run the chosen software.
See [[Movie Making Manual/Equipment and software reviews]] for some software recommendations.

=Hardware components=

==General requirements==
Editing video requires a powerful computer.  If you're planning on working on feature-length films, or working with extensive special effects, this is even more important.  Your home computer might be capable of piecing together your vacation footage, but if you want to able to properly edit a longer film, you need a good machine.  RAM and storage capacity are the most important things here: one minute of uncompressed digital video, as is outputted from a standard MiniDV camcorder, takes up roughly one gigabyte of storage.  

(nope: DV uses DV compression, which is cbr-ish, so there is no 'roughly' either, one minute of DV footage will be 227.601.996 bytes)

If you plan on working in High Definition, this figure jumps much higher.

(nope: you can work in HD by using some cheap formats like HDV, same bitrate as with DV footage)

==Storage==
* Use separate drives for system (e.g a SSD or 10,000rpm [[w:SATA|SATA]]) and storage (e.g. [[w:SATA|SATA]] [[w:RAID|RAID]] array).  [[w:SATA|SATA]] (good value and modern) is an excellent alternative to [[w:SCSI|SCSI]] (older and expensive).

==RAM==
* Depending on your operating system, at least 1GB. If you're using Windows Vista, Microsoft recommends 1GB just to run the OS, so a minimum of 2GB is wise.
RAM these days is very cheap and upto 16GB or more is very affordable with 4GB being a recommended minimum. Remember however that Windows 7 Home Premium will only recognise a maximum of 16GB.

==Computer monitor==
This is perhaps the most important part of your purchase: computer monitors are very different from TV screens, and what looks good on a monitor might not look good on a TV.  If you plan on doing any colour correction, a high quality monitor is a must.  Most editing systems also have a large number of different panels, meaning that the larger your screen size, the better.  A dual monitor setup is a wise choice.

'''Top Choices in Computer Monitors'''
* [[http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=5C4F3312&amp;nclm=AppleDisplaysApple|Cinema Display]]
* [[http://accessories.dell.com/sna/category.aspx?c=ca&amp;category_id=4009&amp;cs=cadhs1&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs|Dell Ultrashrap]]

Many Apple and Dell monitors use the exact same LCD panel, so the monitors are actually very comparable in performance.

==Graphics card==

ATI and nVidia offer graphic cards specially designed for workstations:

* ATI FireMV/FireGL
* nVidia QuadroFX

You can edit videos without these graphic cards, but they make editing a lot smoother, especially real-time effects.

==CPU==

* A Dual-CPU system is preferable, usually server-CPU's like the Intel Xeon and the AMD Opteron are used. If you choose to use desktop-CPU's, an Intel Pentium 4 is better suited for this job than an AMD Athlon 64. New processors from Intel such as the Core 2 Duo are also very well suited to this task.

Update: The Athlon 64 x2 line of cpus outperform Intel cpus including the core 2 duos.
Consider using Athlon chips if you want faster rendering times and smoother realtime editing capabilities.

==Motherboard==
Ensure the motherboard can handle the components you need, with the possibility of expansion.  Additional slots for RAM are handy.

==DVD Burner==

* A reliable, dual/double layer burner.  Don't be fooled by burners advertising high speed: it is best to burn at low speeds to reduce the chance of errors.

==Case==
* Big, quiet, cool, lots of storage

==Power Supply==
* A powerful power supply is a must: an editing station will require lots of power to function properly.

==Keyboard==
* Editing keyboards have all the short cuts already on the keys.  You can buy these keyboards off-the-shelf, or you can buy a standard keyboard and buy stick-on labels.

==Pointing device==
* Consider a graphics tablet because makes fine control of the mouse much easier (it's like using a pen).  Be wary of cheap graphics tablets because they can suffer from judder (i.e. the mouse pointers appears to judder even though your hand is still).  You'll need fine control for such tasks as:
** Jogging back and forth through rushes in a frame-accurate way
** [[w:rotoscoping|Rotoscoping]]

=Assemble=

See [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC]] for details on how to put all those parts together.

=Overclocking=

*[[w:overclocking|WikiPedia article on OverClocking]]

In a film production environment, where deadlines are tight and speed is everything, overclocking your workstation can seem like a tempting option.  However, overclocking a modern computer takes a great deal of patience and knowledge to do correctly.  As such, it's generally OK to overclock your home computer but a bad idea to overclock a production system.  Why?  Because stability is essential in film production.

That said, it is possible to overclock and maintain stability if you're carefull, patient and have the right components.

Gmail is a free, search-based webmail service that includes more than 4,096 megabytes (4 gigabytes) of storage. The backbone of Gmail is a powerful Google search engine that quickly finds any message an account owner has ever sent or received. That means there's no need to file messages in order to find them again.

When Gmail displays an email, it automatically shows all the replies to that email as well, so users can view a message in the context of a conversation. There are no pop-ups or untargeted banner ads in Gmail, which places relevant text ads and links to related web pages adjacent to email messages.

* Cost: Free
* Storage: 15,360 megabytes
* Superior spam protection using innovative Google technology
* Languages: Messages can be sent and read in most languages. The Gmail interface is available in 39 languages: US and UK English, simplified and traditional Chinese, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Filipino, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.
* Access: Free automatic forwarding, POP3 access and IMAP access (not a full implementation)

* JavaScript and cookies must be enabled on all browsers
** Fully supported browsers:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

The verbs быть and жить seem to have aspectual pairs. Быть-пробыть, жить-прожить.
The article says they don't. Need more explanation about that.

First, thanks to the unknown author for this article about the verbs of my mother language.
I have a minor comment about the Verbal  &quot;Pairs&quot;. Not a great deal, but the author may wish to clarify the second para  in same &quot;Pairs&quot;.
The thing is that the perfective verb  разговорить does NOT mean &quot;to converse&quot; or &quot;to chat&quot;. It means to  complete encouraging, making or even forcing somebody else to speak.
For example:
A teacher may разговорить a shy student (so that the student  would give a complete and exhausting answer).
A private  eye   or a policemen under cover may разговорить a witness or neighbours (so as to get some useful information through conversing  or just chatting). 
An executor may разговорить a suspect by  torturing.
Hence, I think that the pair говорить - (раз)говорить  is a bit misleading.
Possibly, another pair думать-подумать would better fit into the subject para.
Думать means &quot;to think&quot; , подумать  means &quot;to give some thought&quot;.
Sorry about interfering and excuse my English.
Sincerely,
Taurox -The-Native-Russian-Speaker   :)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">We traditionally describe phenomena in differential equations, but we would like to simulate and eventually predict their behaviour using numerical methods. This can be done using a traditional top-down approach or a less common bottom up approach.

An inverted method would be to construct from bottom up a cellular automaton, with the same properties as the observed phenomenon differential equation.

== The top down approach ==

The transformation of a differential equation into a discrete system that can be simulated on a computer is called the top-down approach. Let us try a simple example. One dimensional diffusion equation
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = \kappa \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} &lt;/math&gt;
is discretized forward in time and symmetric in space
:&lt;math&gt; c_x^t = c_x^{t-1} + \frac{\Delta t \kappa}{(\Delta x)^2} \left( c_{x+1}^{t-1} - 2c_{x}^{t-1} + c_{x-1}^{t-1} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The produced discrete equation can be seen as a cellular automaton local transition function
:&lt;math&gt; c_x^t = f \left( c_{x+1}^{t-1} c_{x}^{t-1} c_{x-1}^{t-1} \right) &lt;/math&gt;
The time and space discretization is the same for both systems but there is a crucial difference in the discretization of variables. On a common computer a variable is represented using 64-bit floating point numbers whereas a cellular automaton has variables of 2 to 8 bits.

As numerical approximation errors is an important problem using floating point numbers and would be unbearable using only a few bits. We see that there is no direct method to for transforming differential equations into cellular automata, a different approach must be used.

== The bottom up approach ==

This approach begins with selecting a discrete system that inherently possesses some basic properties needed for a simplified model of the original problem. An example of such basic properties is reversibility and preservation of quantities as mass, momentum and energy.
The model is than modified and trimmed till it is sufficiently close to the original problem.

The basic model is usually as simple as possible
If cellular automata are used for the basic model their neighborhood

That really should not be using &quot;long&quot;. For many of us, &quot;long&quot; can be 64-bit and a &quot;WORD&quot; is 32-bit. You can use the proper types from inttypes.h or , since Windows 3.1 and Xenix are dead, you can assume that an int is 32-bit. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:00, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

I'm aware that certain types are platform dependent, but why has no one bothered correcting the actual page? It would be
great if it was accurate; I was unable to find a lot of information on this topic elsewhere. --[[User:84.182.240.46|84.182.240.46]] 08:27, 15 October 2005 (UTC)



This should also explain how to convert RVAs to file offsets. I'm trying to create a program that extracts resources from an EXE file. I've managed to find the &quot;.rsrc&quot; section of the EXE file, and parsed the directory structure. However the IMAGE_RESOURCE_DATA_ENTRY structure is giving me problems, as the &quot;long *Data;&quot; entry in this structure is given as RVA (an offset in virtual memory, relative to the start of the program's virtual memory space, once the EXE file is already running and loaded in memory), and NOT as an offset in the EXE file itself, nor as an offset relative to the start of the &quot;.rsrc&quot; section. How do I convert RVA to file-offset, so I can extract the resources from the EXE file, without running the EXE file?

On March 31, 2004 Google said they would release a free e-mail account with 1,000 Megabytes (ca. 1GB) for every user. Many thought it was a April Fool's joke, but it wasn't. It was an innovative addition to the rather stagnant area of free web-mail services.

On Gmail's 1st birthday, Google gave every Gmail user 2GBs of space and it's increasing with every second. The login page has a ticker showing the amount of free storage space currently offered (ca. 7GB as of 2009).

Originally, the invitations were sent out to a relatively small number of 'elite' internet users, and some journalists. The journalists could review the email service, and in the process create quite a buzz about the service. These users were given different numbers of invites by which they could give a select number of others access. New users also got invites and so the user-base grew by word of mouth.

After a few years in &quot;beta&quot;, Google has opened the service up to everyone to use.

== Features ==
The backbone of Gmail is a powerful Google search engine that quickly finds any message an account owner has ever sent or received. That means there's no need to file messages in order to find them again. For this reason, the Gmail interface implemented no folder structure. It did, however, introduce ''labels''. Instead of placing an email in a single folder, conversations could be categorised with multiple labels. Another innovation amongst web-mail interfaces was the concept of ''conversations'' by which emails are grouped together with their replies.

Other features:
* Utilises JavaScript and cookies heavily.
* Powerful spam filtering
* Email Content-sensitive advertising
* Interface available in multiple languages.
* Automatic forwarding, POP3 and (limited) IMAP access
* Many fully supported browsers

== Obtaining an account ==
Simply go to http://mail.google.com/mail/signup and fill in the form.

== Overview ==

'''''Alohomora''''' is a spell that is used to opens locks on doors and windows.

== Extended description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We are first introduced to this spell two weeks into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s first school year, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] uses it to open a door, so that they can escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]]. Throughout the books, when a locked door is found, Hermione, if she is available, is called upon first to attempt to open it; it seems that she is the most practiced at this particular spell. 

Not all doors will respond to this charm, though; for instance, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] has counter-charmed her door so that ''Alohomora'' will not work, although the knife [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] gave Harry will.

== Analysis ==

One has to wonder about the usefulness of having locks at all in the Wizarding world. The unlocking spell is so simple that a 12-year-old girl can work it, and it is apparently taught as part of the first year curriculum at Hogwarts; and artifacts (such as Sirius' knife) exist that will unlock even those locks that are charmed against the unlocking spell. From a Muggle point of view, we must assume that an ordinary lock, in the Wizarding world, is similar to a Muggle Yale lock that can be slipped with a credit card; basic security and not much more. If the Alohomora countercharm is used, the security is more that of a bolt lock, with Sirius' knife being akin to more specialized lock-picking gear; presumably, that knife would be controlled by Ministry law, or purchased outside of the legal system. And finally there are high-security locks, such as those at the Ministry (one of which actually melts Sirius' knife) and the vaults at Gringotts.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

# Hermione finds this spell in ''The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1'', so why do wizards bother to lock doors in the first place if such a simple spell can open them?

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Skoosh. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Skoosh~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt; 23:42, 17 March 2015 (UTC)

== Renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr”&gt;
This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

==AIDE (for Microsoft Windows)==

AIDE is intented to education and development. It is usuable by several differents programmers since references and environment are saved in seperate directories.

AIDE comes with three differents development environments : a general purpose IDE Emacs based (Glide), a Ada oriented graphic IDE (GPS) or even a console (MSys, Bash compatible).

AIDE also comes with a multilingual Texinfo based documentation toolchain able to generate help files (HTML) and user's manual (PDF) from a single source file.

AIDE is unique by its licence, its integration and its seamless system integration :

    * All the tools needed are free, integrated and already configured ;
    * AIDE is immediately useable after installation ;
    * No file in any system directory ;
    * No environment variables created or modified outside AIDE.

The main components used are :

    * GNAT 3.15p, GtkAda 2.2.0, GPS 2.1.0,  mSys 1.0.8 ;
    * upx 1.22, ucl 1.01 ;
    * gs 7.05, a2ps 4.13, psutils 1.17, file 4.03.

[http://sr.sriviere.info AIDE web site]

== Who is the &quot;we&quot; in... ==

For technical reasons, we recommend against using the Ada compilers included in GCC 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 4.0. Instead, we recommend using GCC 3.4, 4.1 or 4.2, or one of the releases from AdaCore (3.15p, GPL Edition or Pro).

In fact this paragraph was written by an anonymous user [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Ada_Programming/Installing&amp;diff=487482&amp;oldid=475526], but I think that he was [[User:Ludovic Brenta]], maintainer of the GNAT package in Debian, who forgot to login.

== Debian is not a binary distribution [ UPDATED ] ==

The last time I checked, [http://www.debian.org/ Debian] is not a binary distribution.

Debian has always been a source-based distribution where you boot into a mininimal environment that then compiles the software as it is installed on your computer.

The section under Debian [Section 16] has a statement: &quot;Because Debian is a binary distribution, ...&quot;.

This should be clarified. Unless it's been so long that I've missed the changes ( various *buntu's notwithstanding - they're Debian-based, but NOT Debian).

:Debian has been always a binary distribution. Indeed, it supports a wide range of architectures (http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/). You can trust the accuracy of the Debian section, since it has been written mostly by [[User:Ludovic Brenta|Ludovic Brenta]], the official Debian maintainer of the Ada related packages. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|talk]]) 09:59, 8 June 2008 (UTC)

::No argument on the architecture list (insert appropriate smiley here). In the 10+ years I've been playing with Linux (since Slackware first replaced SLS), I recall that Debian (true Debian, not a distribution based on Debian) started as a source-based distribution where the installation process first [ downloaded | copied from CD to hard disk ] the source for the package, then compiled it for the appropriate target machine to make use of hardware capabilities, then installed the package. This was also one of the reasons that people had more installation pains than even Slackware due to the compile cycle (slower computers then). I would be interested in finding out either A) when Debian went binary distribution model, or B) what major (not based-on) distribution I'm thinking of that was source-based only initial install.

::[ UPDATE ] My mistake - it appears I was thinking of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Source-based_Linux_distributions Gentoo Linux]. My bag. --[[User:Alisonken1|Ken Roberts]] ([[User talk:Alisonken1|talk]]) 01:39, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

== Removal of section ==

I'd like to remove Section 4.7.8 (GNAT for Macintosh ...) because (a) it isn't part of a larger distribution, and (b) the [http://www.macada.org/macada/Welcome.html MacAda site referenced] isn't up to date.

More recent GNAT versions for more recent Mac OS X versions can be had from the [http://gnuada.sourceforge.net/ Sourceforge GNU Ada site] referenced in Section 4.3.
 
I've asked the Mac OS X mailing list for comments ... [[User:Sjw|Sjw]] ([[User talk:Sjw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sjw|contribs]]) 13:34, 5 November 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">We're a lot of things. I have hopes that our wiki textbook project will change the world. But I don't think we're wiki-people who do textbooks. Rather, we're textbook-people who use wikis.

==We Have Unique Problems==
I think that we have unique problems. Beyond the problems that face the Wikipedia we have additional challenges. For example, an article on the Wikipedia about Fidel Castro really only has one direction to take: give the facts, the dates, the places, the important people, and the important events. I don't mean to trivialize the effort required to make a high-quality article on Castro -- it takes a lot -- but I do want to show the challenge of writing a book.

For example, how should a book on algorithms be written? There is no canonical form of the &quot;perfect&quot; algorithm book to turn to. One way we write our books is to start out with a table of contents, reach consensus on it, and then restrict ourselves to serving those goals. Sometimes our goals change, but it's better for attracting contributors and for reaching a proud &quot;first edition&quot; to have a goal spelled out early on. The most valuable kind of goals are those that tend to encourage the most educational or instructive results.

Our project has finally matured to the point that we need to define the goal for Wikibooks itself. We are all asking ourselves, What really is a wikibook? Where do we draw the line, if at all?

==Information is Good==
Thinking deeply about this, I came upon a lot of unworkable ideas: Wikibooks should only have what's available in the library. Wikibooks should only have works where there are two like it in the library of congress. Wikibooks should only be for courses taught at accredited schools. In each case, they left out too much.

I know that some of you feel strongly that there is no such thing as leaving out &quot;just enough&quot;: even a single exclusion would be too much. But what happens when we follow this value to its logical conclusion? Imagine a cookbook that contains every recipe anyone ever tried. It'd be terrible. After trying the first five recipes, you'd stop because the results were so poor. The fact is that most recipes aren't that good. I'd much rather have a cookbook with only 1,000 decent-to-outstanding recipes than a cookbook with 100,000 poor-to-outstanding recipes.

I think it can go without proof here that we all want to see true information do its magic by reaching free minds and helping people reach their full potential. But I also think life is short. I once started to study computer programming by reading some decent books, but then I followed up with some mediocre books. And I simply didn't know the difference. Someone more experienced then pointed me to some great books to read. I suppose I wasn't surprised that the books were 20 years old, because this individual was so good I didn't doubt his advice. In a large world, with limited time, quality matters.

Currently we filter out the less-than-quality books through our vote for deletion process. Although VFD is supposed to be a means to reach consensus rather than a raw vote, often it can be a haphazard process. I don't think it's really fair to contributors if we first tell them they can create any book they want if we then later end up deleting it. Similarly, I don't think it's fair to the other contributors (who do produce high-quality works) to have the reputation they earned for Wikibooks get diminished by association with works the community or the founders deem unsuitable. We know there is a problem with our policies somewhere.

==The Wisdom of Crowds==
One suggestion that gets a mention is to use a rating system. This idea is particularly strong with the cookbook. It might be convenient philosophically to follow such an approach. For example, we could do the same for books, and only let the high-quality books reach the front page. We could introduce a book recommendation system to increase the popularity of newer and lesser-known books.

I think for such a plan to work, Wikibooks will need to have grown a bit, and have a large enough &quot;seed&quot; of books to attract serious readers. But I see another problem with such a system. I don't doubt for a second the &quot;wisdom of crowds.&quot; Now, sometimes crowds aren't perfect, but they've shown amazing results again and again. But group averages work best when each party has an actual stake in the outcome. For example, when you buy a stock, you are putting your own money on the line. Through the magic of markets, the price of a stock reflects (more or less) the currently known information about a company and its chance for success. Betting systems have been able to predict presidential elections with high, but not perfect, accuracy.

But I'm not here to defend that view, because I don't think a system of votes for popularity and recommendations will work well for our site. The recommendation system of Amazon works because it bases (some) of the information directly from what people have purchased. If someone wanted to play with the ratings and game the system it will end up being very expensive for them. On the other hand, we are all aware of sock puppeting. In the presence of such disruptions the results are skewed enough to be meaningless.

==A Proposed Policy==
In reviewing what Jimbo has said, how VFDs turn out, and considering the opinions of all of the voices involved in our project, I have, with the help of others, [[Wikibooks_talk:Policy/Vote#A_directly_enumerated_WikiBooks_policy|enumerated a policy]] I think that is appropriate for Wikibooks. This policy reflects my opinion that I'd rather have a Wikibooks site with 1,000 decent to great books than a Wikibooks site with 10,000 terrible/offensive to great books. Actually, let me restate that. I'd rather have a Wikibooks site with 100,000 great books!

But already I've triggered some subjective terms. Offensive to whom? To whose standards must we conform? While I believe we could have great results with a liaise-faire, anything-goes, all-legal-books-are-allowed approach, I doubt any results will be realized until there's a rating system based on people who are putting something of real value at stake.

Until then, we need real standards. This includes both standards of quality and appropriateness. It also includes providing a sharper direction for the project. Remember that the Castro article on the Wikipedia already has the &quot;canonical encyclopedic entry&quot; standard to head to. We need our own direction, because modules do not turn themselves into complete, coherent books by the wisdom of crowds. The only time I've seen a book become complete, coherent, consistent, and worth reading is when a small group of individuals coordinated heavily and took commanding roles. (I am, however, sure that the proof reading, rewording, spellchecking and other improvements to an ''already completed'' work need no coordination.)

My thoughts on the standards of quality, for example, requiring books to have a direction, and for all modules to belong to an on-topic book, seem to be agreeable. My thoughts on where to draw the line are the most controversial.

For example, I think it would be wise to follow the letter and spirit of US law. Actually, in this regard, we don't have a choice. But even more controversial than that is if we should adapt rules similar to the Google AdSense prohibitions.

Such an adaptation would not be unheard of. Content on Wikicities already has such restrictions. It would also create the option for people to host our books on their own sites. (Indeed, they will profit from the fruits of our labors, but they will serve to provide a mirror when our site is down, they will do any promotion themselves, and they'll likely include links back to Wikibooks-- This all means that we can reach more people, which is the reason we write.)

I think most surprisingly is that such a list of exclusions, which is likely based on what makes advertisers feel the most comfortable, has very little, if any, limitations on the role of being an instructional resource.

I don't think classrooms are useless for the real world either. In particular, with the &quot;information helps the victims&quot; argument, there are responsible ways to enable people to take precautions, and then there are reckless ways. By sticking to the responsible side we improve our reputation, and we can become trusted guides. In some ways the exclusions serve only to make a speedy delete out of what currently needs to go through VFD. Encoding this wisdom we've gained into rules makes for a more consistent site.

Also, I have doubts that any book written directly for these dark gray areas can evolve into useful resources. The more base books, which were guides to breaking the law and intimidating or harming others, were canyons away from ever becoming an honest book to aid crime prevention. I don't think honest people would even desire to do what's necessary to turn those books into good guides.

I believe that if there is something worth knowing that it can be taught responsibly and in a proper instructional context. I provide the following reasons why I think Wikibooks should avoid the dark gray areas, and allow any attempts at creating them to become speedily deleted:
* By being closer to Wikicities's policy we can more easily convert works to and from that site to our site
* By following the AdSense rules we are creating valuable economic incentives for others to create mirrors of our site
* By not advocating the darkest areas we will have less danger of tort action; it's not fair to those writing mathematics books that the site would be shut down based solely on one misguided book
* By adhering closer to community standards, we are leaving open more doors, so that the site will be able to be accessed from more schools, more public libraries, and more organizations than perhaps otherwise
* By respecting community standards, like those practiced at universities, we are more welcoming to expert contributors, who might only spend large amounts of time at sites that they could list on their CVs without embarrassment
* By constraining the ''way'' we frame and present material, rather than restricting the true knowledge beneath, we are guided more toward instructional exposition and guided closer to true books for learning

I know that it pains many for this project to &quot;censor&quot; itself (which implies, ultimately, the censorship of some contributor). But the gains from a project taking editorial guidance should not be confused with the evils of government censorship and oppression. We ultimately want to teach others what we have learned. The true, worthy lessons that can be gained from dark gray areas can be taught without the dark gray baggage itself. The smartest people are able to connect the dots for themselves. That is the nature of knowledge: it can be used for good or evil. We will never get around the fact that some people could use what we tech them for bad purposes.

But instead of teaching people how to make bongs, we should teach general craft making. (You can figure out the final step yourself.)

Instead of teaching people how to make explosives, we should teach chemistry. (And after really understanding chemical reactions, instead of just following directions, you'll know the true dangers enough to make an ''informed'' decision for yourself.)

Instead of teaching people just the human capacity of hate, we should teach the humanities. (You can then understand both the pathetic ''and'' the triumphant nature of mankind that way.)

As educators we must take the ethical path, make the hard decisions, and give serious thought to important legal or economic considerations. But most importantly: We must be a good example for others.</text>

Look on the left options bar.  You will see links to compose messages, go to the inbox, view a particular label, etc.  Down at the bottom, right below the label box, is the invite box.  This tells you how many invites you have left and provides a box in which you can put an email address.  Just put the email address of the recipient and click '''Send Invite'''.

Your GMail account may not have this box enabled, however. If there is no Invite box available, Google advises you to &quot;be patient&quot;, as they randomly allow some users to issue invites, and other users must wait. Finally each user only has a limited number of invites they are able to offer at any given time, and you may need to wait for further invites to be available.

Right now, every user can invite, but in fact this is not needed. GMail is now available for everyone and everybody can register.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why the number of books doesn't matter==

Admit it- you knew I'd bite on this :)

I don't think the number of books really matters that much to the average quality of books, or to the usefulness of the sight.  Let me explain why.

First off- the average quality of books.  The average contributor doesn't want to come and add content to random_book_0001.  He wants to add content to a specific subject.  This is especially true with new and starting books-  he might make a quick edit of an existing book to add or fix something, but writing significant text requires a passion for the subject.  If he can't write about his preferred subject he is unlikely to just switch subjects, he's more likely not to significantly contribute.  This is a loss for Wikibooks.  Instead of some content, we have none.  Reducing the number of allowed subjects only works if the people that would have contributed still do.  I don't think that would be the case.  (Note: that doesn't mean we shouldn't clarify the policy about what is and isn't a wikibook, it means that we shouldn't discourage any topic IMHO).

And yes, the above is describing how I feel personally as well as what I feel as well as how I think the average contributor would act.  If I was told I could only write on certain narrow topics, or had to get approval for some other topic I just wouldn't bother.  I enjoy teaching, but there's other things just as valuable I could be doing.

In addition, the place I expect this will hurt most is versus our best assets.  You mentioned yourself- the best books are those written in the majority by 1 man or a small team, and then tweaked by others.  The same situation goes on in open source- the biggest projects, including Linux, tend to have a core of 1-2 dozen people who do 90%+ of the work.  Why do they put in the effort?  They're passionate about the subject.  If those people aren't allowed to work on the subjects they're passionate about, they won't work as hard if at all.


Secondly- usefulness.  People don't generally come to read a random book.  They come to read up on a specific topic (say, differential equations) or a general topic (math).  These topics will have a large amount of overlap- people tend to want to research the same thing.  If people are frequently using a resource, it will eventually become good through user additions.  So all the important books become good very quickly.

What about those who look for infrequently used books?  One of two things- we have something or we don't.  If we don't have it, we get a reputation for being useless.  If we do have something thats at least decent, we win.  Who knows, they may even know enough to add to it.

The only thing that really hurts us is if a very bad book exists for a topic.  This gets taken care of by vfd.  But this can and will happen even with a very restricitve policy.  Instead what we need is some type of alpha phase so books aren't advertised til they're at least usable (which may be an interesting idea- an in development page for books being actively written?).  Personally, I'm not adding my book math book to the math bookshelf until its at least half done- that way even if I never finish it will at least be usable, and in a good position to be improved.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 23:33, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

:Just look at the vast majority of the books on our site. Most of them don't come anywhere ''close'' to the narrow gray areas excluded by AdSense. We would mostly just be turning away books that we delete anyway, just faster. If a person could only contribute to one of these undesirable areas (doubtful, if they are a motivated and intelligent individual) I don't think it's a great loss if they need to find some other resource on the web instead.

:Also, when you count contributors turned away that otherwise would have contributed you must also consider new folks who will be attracted to contribute when they might have been turned off before.

:But I should drive home the point that the ''specific'' exclusions we are talking about are a minority of contributions, and there are many advantages to consider by eliminating those forms of contributions. (Afterall, the &quot;real knowledge&quot; can be communicated in a book that is more suited to be instructional.)

:In regards to your alpha phase comment, have you seen what I have to say about [[User:Mshonle/Charters|charters]]? The idea would be that the main page would show mostly chartered books, but might have an unchartered books section much like our &quot;new books&quot; sections. A book can start to be written before it has a charter, but once the charter is in place it will be easier for others to both contribute and make the book more valuable (because it increases the chances of the contributions remaining in the book and being appropriate for its scope). It would also lend towards better intrabook communication and coordination, so contribution efforts are even better allocated. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:12, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

::I can see a couple of issues with the idea of charters
::#People in general hate administrative duties.  Writing the charters would be a pain in the ass
::#It requires shelf owners to be and remain active members of the community.  Or perhaps shelves make a decision as a vote of all owners of books on the shelf?
::#It requires active and swift decisions on charters.  If we take a week to approve or disapprove, we'll lose contributors.  And it requires the right people to be making those decisions.  Same problem with the right people for shelf owners.
::#It might require software rights  not in MediaWiki.  We'd need to give a small set of people not beauracrats or admins the rights to alter certain pages (shelves) but not others.  There's some code that can be leveraged to do so with a bit of code, but I'm not sure if full support is in version 1.4.9.  Although if it is I'll find it soon-  I'm actually setting up an internal wiki for my employer.
::#Here's the big one you'll be raked over the coals for- its not in the spirit of wiki.  It might end up with better end results, depending on what your goals are- benevolent dictatorships tend to be more efficient at reaching singular goals than democracies and anarchies.  But the spirit of wiki is free submissions without a hierarchy making decisions.  A lot of people would see this as going against that.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 17:47, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

:::It's true that there would need to be an active shelf community. But this would not be a special right or require any software changes. You wouldn't be elected to it or anything: It's just people who are involved in that area. I would assume some people who like the higher-level ideas would be more about starting charters than perhaps the contributors. For example, it's similar to designing a whole curriculum. Someone might not want to author an entire curriculum, but would be very instrumental in designing what is said when and how.
:::I think largely we are already doing charters to some extent. Mostly it's by setting up the table of contents before hand, for those books that aren't mostly written by one person, that is. '''You can't get around the need to coordinate efforts''' (who wants to see insertion sort get covered in three places in the same book if it's as if the other explainations didn't exist?)
:::I agree that people would have a reaction against it (yet it amazes me people don't have a knee-jerk reaction against the NPOV requirement-- I think it's a wise requirement, but, man, that limits what and how you can write more than the AdSense limitations do, ''far more''). But it's not against the spirit of the wiki. If someone starts to write MFC content for the C++ book, someone could just say &quot;hey, that's not in the charter,&quot; and boom, they just create a new book instead.
:::I don't think the process would have to be swift. A charter is just saying what the book will talk about. Those involved in a shelf could whip out several charters in a go, essentially the same as making stub books. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:23, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

==Ratings==

WHile I don't oppose a rating system, I'm not sure what use it would be.  Generally, you want a rating system to tell which is better between 2 like things- two books on C++, or two on Calculus.  You don't compare Calculus and C++ books.  Right now, we actively merge different books on the same subject.  So there's no reason to compare.  

In addition, its quite possible a ratings system could hurt books.  If people don't read it because its rating is low, they won't contribute, and it won't improve.  A low rating could act as a barrier to improvement, rather than a way to improve the average quality.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 23:33, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

:Excellent point about like-things. To me I see the rating system as a way to avoid unsavory content, much like Slashdot's rating system. But it does only make sense in the context of letting any old troll or spammer write a book (in other words &quot;all legal content is accepted&quot;). But it seems we've already agreed we want more control than that, particularly in the cases of stopping forks from dividing contributions. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:59, 20 September 2005 (UTC)

::Rating system- it wold be nice in having a rate system but it seems to me an impossibility (who will rate the books?). Since most books are unfinished works (I gess no book can or will be able to claim it's finished), and all are always mutating, how can any rating be valid over even a small period of time ?
::Does anyone realy gives any attention on book ratings? (I don't, I go by references and quotes), another option would be creating in every book talk page a comment area, but that is almost there on the discussion, if anyone would comment a book why don't they edit, discuss or get involved on the writing ?!?
::Forking does not divide contributions, fork wars does (like stamping a note for stoping other to contribute to one of the versions), preventing forks on site does provide a dificulty on moving contents, as all books are GFDL fork may even increase contribution and again, I point to you that every derivated work of any given book is a fork.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:21, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Summary ==

The [[Ada Programming/Pragmas|pragma]] '''Convention''' directs the compiler to represent a type or subprogram using a foreign language convention. 

The set of supported foreign languages depends on the compiler implementation. Typically [[C Programming|C]], [[C++]], [[COBOL]], and [[Fortran]] are supported.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|type}} My_C_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|record}} ''[...]'';
 {{Ada/--|Ada will represent My_C_Type as a C-style structure.}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Convention}} (C, My_C_Type);

== Summary ==

The [[Ada Programming/Pragmas|pragma]] '''Normalize_Scalars''' directs the compiler to initialize otherwise uninitialized scalar variables with predictable values. If possible, the compiler will choose out-of-range values.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/pragma|Normalize_Scalars}};
 ...
 My_Variable : Positive; {{Ada/--|Oops, forgot to initialize this variable.}}
                         {{Ada/--|The compiler (may) initialize this to 0}}
 ...
 {{Ada/--|Oops, using a variable before it is initialized!}}
 {{Ada/--|An exception should be raised here, since the compiler}}
 {{Ada/--|initialized the value to 0 - an out-of-range value for the Positive type.}}
 Some_Other_Variable := My_Variable;

 '''pragma''' Pack (''local_name'');

== Description ==

'''Pack''' is a representation [[Ada Programming/Pragmas|pragma]] that directs the compiler to use type representations that favor conservation of storage space, rather than ease of access. It can be used with composite types, like arrays and records. Using pragma Pack will usually result in smaller data structures at the cost of additional operations to retrieve each element (bit operations may be required in order to retrieve packed data). This may or may not result in a loss of execution time, since the increase of instructions executed to access each element can be cheaper than the cost to read an unpacked data structure from memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup 
 |      title = Sub-optimal code for packed boolean arrays &amp;mdash; bug or inherent limitation?
 |     author = Robert A. Duff
 |       date = 2007-07-09
 |  newsgroup = comp.lang.ada
 |         id = wccodim33u0.fsf@shell01.TheWorld.com
 |        url = http://groups.google.es/group/comp.lang.ada/msg/685e3a9bc6dcf58d
 | accessdate = 2008-05-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

 {{Ada/--|A boolean is typically stored in a byte by the compiler, not a bit}}
 {{Ada/--|An array of eight booleans will therefore occupy 64 bits, not 8!}}
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Packed_Bool_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (1 .. 8) {{Ada/kw|of}} Boolean;
 {{Ada/--|With pragma pack, the compiler will try to compress the entire array,}}
 {{Ada/--|in this case probably into a single byte (but this is not guaranteed).}}
 {{Ada/--|Accessing one of these booleans, however, will require bit operations.}}
 {{Ada/pragma|Pack}} (Packed_Bool_Array);

== Incorrect usage ==

{{:Ada Programming/Pragmas/Pack/1}}

== Portability ==

The pragma Pack is standard in the language since Ada 83. However, implementations are allowed to produce different results or to ignore it completely, and therefore it is not portable between compilers. It can produce different results depending on the target architecture too. Thus the pragma Pack [[#Exact data representation|should not be used when an exact representation is required]] for a type.

== Interfacing ==

There is no equivalent standard feature in other programming languages as far as the authors know, so this pragma should not be used when interfacing.

GCC provides an extension to the C programming language that can be used to pack structs, unions (equivalent to Ada's records) or enumeration types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual
 |     author = Free Software Foundation
 |      title = Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
 |    section = 5.35 Specifying Attributes of Types &amp;mdash; &lt;tt&gt;packed&lt;/tt&gt;
 | sectionurl = http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Type-Attributes.html
 | accessdate = 2008-11-23
 |      quote = packed: This attribute, attached to struct or union type definition, specifies that each member (other than zero-width bitfields) of the structure or union is placed to minimize the memory required. When attached to an enum definition, it indicates that the smallest integral type should be used.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the &lt;tt&gt;packed&lt;/tt&gt; attribute is not an standard feature of the C language, and cannot be used with arrays like in Ada.

== Study Techniques ==
Different subjects call for different studying techniques.  There are the subjects that require the student to absorb information, and regurgitate it on demand, the social sciences for example, and those that require solving problems, mathematics for obvious reasons.  The type of textbook used varies depending on the subject, but there are two basic types - chapter with study questions and guides, and chapter with practice problems.

For subjects that require absorbing information there is a five step study technique that works well if it is followed faithfully.  The basic design for textbooks follow a certain pattern - chapters broken down into sections, with objectives at the beginning of the sections or chapters, supplemental information throughout the main text, and study guide and questions at the end of the section or chapter.

== Steps to study ==
If there are lectures, do Steps 1 and 2 before the lecture on the topic. Make no attempt to understand the material, just read it to get the vocabulary into your brain.  When the professor mentions a concept, you will be surprised at how much more sense it makes.  Do Steps 2 (again) and  Steps 3 and 4 shortly after the lectures, concentrating on the material that was presented in the lectures.  Periodically throughout the course, do Steps 1 and 5 for all of the material that has already been presented.  Short reviews, at intervals of a week or so, are better than an 8-hour cram session the day before a test.  There is a biological reason for this that is too complex to explain here, but students that &quot;study early and study often&quot; will learn more and remember it better.

;Step 1: Scan or skim through the section or chapter of the textbook being studied.  Included should be reading all information in the margins, as well as sidebar information set off from the rest of the text in their own sections.  Look at all the pictures and graphs, and read their titles.  This will give you a basic idea of the information the section is trying to convey.

;Step 2: Read and understand all the objectives at the beginning of the chapter.  Read all study questions and study guide material at the end of the chapter.  This may seem unreasonable at first, to look at the questions being asked before reading the text, but it helps to focus the mind on the material that needs to be gleaned from reading the text.  One cannot, after all, absorb everything verbatim.  Knowing what is in the guides, and the knowing the questions being asked, gives the student an idea of what to focus on as the text is read.

;Step 3: The hardest part, READ THE TEXT!!!  It has to be done.  Passive reading alone is not adequate if the student is to get anything at all from the text.  Active reading is needed, which involves focusing on the material, using the information in the study questions and guides at the end as a clue to what exactly should be learned.  Furthermore, if time permits, taking notes will be extremely helpful.  When taking notes writing down concepts verbatim as they appear in the text book will help to an extent, but paraphrasing the concepts in your own words will force you to think about the concepts, and thus increase your retention rate. There may be concepts that you cannot be sure you understand well even with careful re-readings, write down these questions for later.
:Being over fastidious and reading pages not assigned has varying success. For novels and journals it is obviously helpful, as it is for classes with a discussion component. However, if you discover that the pages outside assigned reading refer to terms with different names than are used in class or are entirely irrelevant, it can be a mistake to try to live up to any promise to yourself to read more than the assigned pages in the book.

;Step 4: Answer the study questions.  Do them without referring to the text, and write them down.  Thinking the answers through is not enough, the mind is too prone to fooling the student into thinking the material has taken hold when it hasn't.  If there are questions that the student cannot answer, the student should guess.  A wrong answer helps the student focus on the right answer when it comes along, and the right answers will come along in the next step.

;Step 5: Review the text, using the answers to the study questions as a guide.  This is where the student finds the correct information to answer the questions they didn't know, or refines the answers that they did know.  It is important to re-read any passages that contain information that was unclear to the student, which will be indicated by how well the student answered the questions in the previous step.

This process is very helpful if questions at the end of the section are assigned as homework to be turned in, for obvious reasons.  If the student is fastidious about following these steps, absorbing and retaining the information will come.  

For the subjects where problem solving is the skill to be acquired, nothing can replace practice.  Do problems over and over again.  Do them alone, do them with other students, do them with tutors.  Do them again and again, and when those problems are mastered, find more to do.

== Creating lasting connections ==
To really remember and understand a topic, it is important to see the information in different contexts and to apply the information in a practical setting. The best way to do this is to check and edit Wikipedia articles on the subject. You will have to explain topics both in laymens terms and using technical terms. Justify your changes in the discussion page. You will have to think about the concepts carefully to decide which category and article your information belongs in. Reading all of these related pages will let you see the same information presented in a different context, which is the best way to study. If you have the time, finding outside references to justify yourself or to give an outside reference to a page that has none, find a page on Google. That will give you even more of the subject written in a different context. 
In a developed subject on wikipedia, such as chemistry or geology, you may not have as many opportunities to write concepts out fully yourself. After your edits on Wikipedia, you can usually start or contribute to a large body of needed information on a wikibook. Even in a developed wikibook you can add chapter questions or anything you think would help someone understand the topic.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preface ==
This text was written as a reference on the proof of Criminal Code offences, as well as the legal doctrines that can be applied in proving offences, and the available defences. The audience for this text will be mostly criminal law practitioners, police officers, and law students, who need a convenient way to look up principles and case law. Where possible there are links to cited cases on CanLII for ease of reference.

As of this writing this text remains a work in progress. Errors and omissions should be expected and so it is always recommended that source materials be consulted to confirm the contents of these materials. Any contributions, be they simply correcting citations, copy editing, or substantive contributions, would be greatly appreciated. 

You can contact the main author at PullUpYourSocks1@gmail.com, if you have any questions or comments.

== Organization of Book ==

This book is organized into five Chapters. The first three chapters, Proof of Elements, Doctrine of Liability, and Principles of Interpretation are intended to provide coverage of the basic principles and elements that make up the proof of fact in a criminal context.

The remaining two chapters, Offences and Defences, cover the legal interpretation and application of particular criminal code offences as well as the available defences recognized in Canadian law.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
An accused person who is able to raise a defence can escape criminal liability for an offence that they could otherwise be convicted for. 

Defences are often categorized as follows:
* Justification: a justifiable act is one that makes out the offence but is justified by the external circumstances in which the act was committed. (e.g. self-defence)
* Excuse: a criminal act is excused where the accused would have committed an undesirable criminal offence, for which punishment would be morally inappropriate due to the extenuating circumstances. (eg. offences due to mental infirmities, duress)
* Affirmative Defence: a defence that, if proven, will eliminate liability despite all the elements of the offence having been made out
* Negating Defence: a defence that negates one more more of the essential elements of the prosecution's case.

Under s. 794, the burden is on the defendant to prove an exception or excuse:
{{quotation|
794 (1)  No exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification prescribed by law is required to be set out or negatived, as the case may be, in an information.
&lt;br&gt;
(2) The burden of proving that an exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification prescribed by law operates in favour of the defendant is on the defendant, and the prosecutor is not required, except by way of rebuttal, to prove that the exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification does not operate in favour of the defendant, whether or not it is set out in the information.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec794 CCC]
}}


Excuses and justifications &quot;do not negative the mens rea rather they operate by justifying or excusing what would otherwise be criminal conduct&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hibbert, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frjf 1995 CanLII 110] (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973 (SCC) para. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Raising a Defence==
Before the trier-of-fact can consider a defence, thus requiring the crown to disprove at least one of the elements of the defence beyond a reasonable doubt, there must be an &quot;air of reality&quot; to the defence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cinous 2002 SCC 29, (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) at paras. 53-54 and 65&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the air of reality test is to prevent &quot;outlandish defences&quot; being put to the jury that would be &quot;confusing and would invite unreasonable verdicts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cinous, [http://canlii.ca/t/51tb 2002 SCC 29], [2002] 2 SCR 3 at 84&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Resolved Issues ==

Here we list all those issues that we have already decided upon and why.

=== Splash page ===

Our wikibook had a spash page, but after much discussion it was decided that it it served no purpouse other than to show the flag. Therefore we now have the flag on our homepage. We don't need a splash page. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 10:00, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)

=== Target Audience ===

The target audience are people who know nothing about Japanese. They know no kana, no kanji, no nothing. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 11:26, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

=== Roomaji and Kana ===

After a long, (really long) discussion and voting, the majority of contributers decided not to use Roomaji in the examples at all, but teach the kana in the first few lessons. We also decided to link the kana to soundfiles, so that one can click on the individual kana and hear how they should be pronounced.

The incredibly long discussion was posted on the mailinglist on 10 Nov 2004, where it will remain in the archive for those interested. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 08:20, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Or would, if the message history went so far back anymore... [[User:130.233.22.111|130.233.22.111]] 03:59, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

::Unfortunately the old mailing list (Yahoo group) was mysteriously deleted, so the current mailing list is not the mailing list where the discussion took place. All discussions from the old mailing list have been lost. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 21:44, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

In a subsequent discussion, the majority agreed that in instances where roomaji was necessary (such as describing linguistic concepts with Japanese words), that we use the following conventions.
* Consonants will be written using the Revised Hepburn system (s, sh, z, j, t, ts, ch, f)
* Long vowels be written according to kana spelling (aa, ii, uu, ee, ei, oo, and ou)
* n mora will be wrtitten n' before a vowel or &quot;y&quot; (zen'aku)
* n mora before &quot;m&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, or &quot;p&quot; will ''not'' be changed to &quot;m&quot; (&quot;senpai&quot;, not &quot;sempai&quot;)

== Things Too Minor to Give Place in TOC ==
but are in there anyways!

=== Japanese Exercises ===

I know that I haven't made that many, only comprising of the first two Katakana lessons, but I've only done so because I need feedback. Please tell me what you think of what I've made. A simple &quot;it works&quot; will suffice. --[[User:Akir|Akir]]

:they help :)


=== Author Recomendations ===

== My steping in ==
Sorry to step in before reading the contributor guider. but i don't think self-contained a good idea, that's not systematical enough for learners IMO. and maybe u guys would like to see if the catalog i changed in [[Japanese/Elementary Japanese]] appropriate. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 02:26, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Hi Yacht, maybe it's best not to number the lessons. I'm going to change the rule in [[Japanese/Contributor's Guide]] to ask everyone to use the format &quot;Japanese/Lesson/Description of Lesson&quot;. Then the lessons can be moved about more conveniently. The numbering of lessons does seem to make arrangement of lessons more problematic. [[User:Mkn|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]-- [[User talk:Mkn|Mkn]] 01:13, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

well, i know that soon after i created the catalog, that's why i posted my questions here. but don't u think it's a bit wierd if a text book is not arranged by being numbered? that's quite surprising to me when i first enter this textbook, because that makes this textbook more like a reference for those who have already have some knowledge of Japanese (i mean grammar reference, or a quick reference for travellers) rather than a book for a basic who doesn't know Japanese at all but want to learn Japanese systematically. i don't think they expect to encouter so many long sentences at the very first beginning. what do u think? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 07:12, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Hi Yacht, the actual page name can omit lesson numbers. See [[Japanese/Basic Japanese]]. It's more convenient to use the convention &quot;Japanese/Lesson/Greetings&quot; for example. then just write &quot;Lesson 2: ((Japanese/Lesson/Greetings|Greetings))&quot;. The original page before the major modifications is [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese/Contents&amp;oldid=56864 here]. You can see that the lessons consisted of just vocabulary, phrases, grammar. But because they were listed like a reference, they were moved into their own page sections. Other major changes was the decision to drop romaji, which resulted in the creation of kana lessons, which also spawned kanji lessons. This is part of the decision to make this wikibook &quot;self-contained&quot; to avoid relying heavily on external links.
:Which leads us to the lessons now. Very few people seem able or willing to write the content for actual lessons (or they could be unavailable). I wasn't able to write any lessons because of the lack of experience. But now I'm using some Japanese language course videos to summarize and get a better idea of how to write the lessons while avoiding plagiarizing their content. However, the way I'm writing the lessons needs to be improved upon by making it easier to read and understand. I hope to make it practical and interactive. Adding review lessons to test the reader's knowledge. How are you writing the lessons? Do you use any textbook or video to help you? [[User:Mkn|&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]-- [[User talk:Mkn|Mkn]] 08:37, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

well, i c. it's okay to go without numbering the lessons when naming them, but as in the textbook, i advice they'd better to be arranged by numbers. my suggested structure is in [[Japanese/Elementary Japanese/Lesson 1]] (&lt;--i also found this naming not ''wiki'' enough, should be [[Japanese/Elementary Japanese/Lesson 1]] :P ). oh, yes, i have Japanese textbook, because i am not a Japanese native speaker. the catalog is more or less similar to my textbook, step by step. --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] 06:43, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)
----
&lt;center&gt;'''Return to [[Japanese]] table of contents'''&lt;/center&gt;

I was Nezumi and was working on the Japanese for a while, however, I decided to leave it behind because I'm working on college right now. However, I will be transferring schools so I can get back into japanese. You can delete my sections. Nezumi is kanji incase you didn't notice that.

== A transwiki-ed page ==
I just happend to find a page [[Japanese/Guide]], which is moved from the wikipedia article [[w:en:Japanese language guide]]. Since no link to the page has been made, this so-called &quot;transwiki&quot; does not seem to work well... I'm not sure but some might find something useful on the page. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 08:05:17, 2005-09-05 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{urdu}}

'''Urdu'''(&amp;#1575;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1583;&amp;#1608;) is an Indo-European language which originated in India, most likely in the vicinity of Delhi, whence it spread to the rest of the subcontinent. Other major metropolitan areas with a strong tradition of the language include Hyderabad, Lucknow, and Lahore.

Urdu developed as a vernacular dialect from the interaction between local Indian [[Sanskrit]]-derived Prakrits and the languages that were spoken in the courts of the rulers of Indian subcontinent, from the time of the Delhi Sultanate to the Mughal Empire and its succeeding states. The language of the court, and of literature, was usually [[Persian]], while that of religion was Arabic, the language of the Qur'an. This process of the mingling of these languages and the local dialects led to the development of everyday speech that sounded much like today's Urdu and [[Hindi]]. There is still a spectrum of dialects spoken in the streets of cities from Lahore and Karachi to Delhi and Calcutta and in the villages all over the region.

Urdu, especially in its less formalized form as it developed from a dialect to a more formal language, has also been referred to as &quot;''raikhtha''&quot; &lt;sup&gt;[[Urdu language#Footnote|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;, which literally means &quot;a rough mixture&quot;.

The formal language is sometimes referred to as ''Zaban-e-Urdu-e-Moalla'' (&amp;#1586;&amp;#1576;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1606;&amp;#65146; &amp;#1575;&amp;#1585;&amp;#1583;&amp;#1608;&amp;#65146; &amp;#1605;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1729;), which can be translated as &quot;Language of Camp and Court&quot;. The word ''urdu'' itself means &quot;army&quot;, &quot;horde&quot; or &quot;tent&quot; in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. ''Urdu'',  the Turkish word ''ordu'', and the word ''horde'' (found in several European languages) have the same origin. 

It soon became the language of the Mughals, distinguished linguistically from local languages by its large and extensive Arabic-[[Persian]] vocabulary (40%) superimposed on a base of grammar, usages and vocabulary that it shares in common with [[Hindi]]. The result was what has been called one of the world's most beautiful languages, the &quot;Kohinoor&quot; (&quot;Mountain of Light,&quot; a famed native, large and brilliant diamond) of India. It is widely spoken today in both India and Pakistan and all countries having a sizeable South Asian diaspora.

The mix of Urdu and Hindi, forming the Hindustani dialects spoken in northern India and Pakistan, form the second-most-popular 'first' language and second-most-popular 'first or second' language in the world. Urdu by itself is the twentieth most popular 'first' language in the world and the national language of Pakistan.

==Introduction==
Urdu is a language written in the Persian-Arabic script, which is from right to left. You are probably wondering, &quot;what does Urdu look like?&quot; Here are some examples:

پاکستان کے دارالحکومت اسلام آباد سمیت ملک کے شمالی علاقوں میں منگل اور بدھ کی درمیانی شب اور بدھ کی صبح زلزلے کے مزید جھٹکے ریکارڈ کیے گئے ہیں جن کی ریکٹر سکیل پر شدت پانچ اعشاریہ آٹھ ہے۔

Taken by itself, {{Unicode|Urdū}} is approximately the twentieth most populous natively spoken language in the world, and is the national language of [[Pakistan]] as well as one of the 23 national languages of India.  

{{Unicode|Urdū}} also refers to a standardised register of Hindustani termed ''{{unicode|khaṛī bolī}}'', that emerged as the standard dialect of Urdu. 
{{Unicode|Urdū}} is often contrasted with [[Hindi]], another standardised form of Hindustani. The primary differences between the two are that Standard {{Unicode|Urdū}} is written in Nastaliq script and draws heavily on Persian and Arabic vocabulary, while standard Hindi is written in [[Devanagari]] and has supplemented some of its [[Persian]] and Arabic vocabulary with words from [[Sanskrit]]. The term &quot;{{Unicode|Urdū}}&quot; also includes dialects of Hindustani other than the standardised languages. Other than these, linguists consider {{Unicode|Urdū}} and Hindi to be the same language. On a conversational level at least, Urdu and Hindi are mutually intelligible.</text>

'''''Nasta'liq''''' or '''''Nasta'leegh''''' (&amp;#1606;&amp;#1587;&amp;#1578;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1604;&amp;#1740;&amp;#1602;) is a specific style for writing in the Arabic alphabet. It is the preferred style for writing Urdu, but is mostly considered a form of calligraphic art for writing other languages, specially Persian and Ottoman Turkish. The name derives from mixing ''Naskh'' and ''Ta'leeq'', two other writing styles, of which Nasta'liq is a descendant.

In Iran, Nasta'liq is usually written with a somewhat thick reed pen (with a tip of about 5mm), and a special kind of carbon ink. In Pakistan, various kinds of pens and inks are used, because of the higher usage of the style.

Producing high quality Nasta'liq in print is a demanding process. For example, Monotype's attempt to implement Nasta'liq for photo composer typesetting resulted in a glyph repertoire of 20,000 different glyphs.  See explanation below:

This is due to the vertical displacement of characters when they are joined together.  As more characters join together (usually 2-5), each one of the previous ones moves slightly up.  The OTF font specification can handle this and beautiful nasta'liq is now possible on regular rendering engines such as the Windows Uniscribe engine that ships with Microsoft Windows 2000 onwards.

As Urdu fontography is evolving, a number of issues with its Unicode representation have been raised.  At the moment, the font that complies best with Unicode and OTF is Nafees Nasta'liq, produced by CRULP (Center for Research in Urdu Language Processing)
[http://www.crulp.org/software/localization.htm]

If you have Nafees Nasta'liq installed, the text and image below should be identical. Note the previous letters being shifted up:

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{math chapter stub}}
The term &quot;reasoning&quot; is used to denote both a cognitive activity and a formal, mathematical one. Traditionally, mathematical reasoning relies on precise rules leading from a set of well-formed statements to a (set of) well-formed, valid conclusion(s). But, many cognitive behaviors considered reasoning do not fall within the descriptive reach of these classical formalisms. To address these, modal logics and other non-classical mathematical formalisms have been devised.
==Classical Reasoning==
===Deduction===
'''Definition''' (Deductive reasoning is reasoning from a general premise to conclusions directly implied by that premise. For example, if we accepted the axiom that all cows are white, then it logically follows that when one encounters Bessie the cow, Bessie will be white.)

===Induction===
'''Definition''' (Inductive reasoning is the usage of specific conclusions to draw more general premises. For example, if one saw a black dog, it would be inductive reasoning to argue that all dogs are therefore black.)

==Non-Classical Reasoning==
===Modal Logics===
====Epistemic Reasoning====

The phrase &quot;Reasoning about Knowledge&quot;, often refers to the application of [[epistemic logic]] to multi-agent systems.  It has applications in game theory and economics.  An example of reasoning about knowledge can be seen in the following scenario:
A father has three sons who are playing in the back yard despite the fact that it is muddy.  He announces to them &quot;At least one of you has mud on his face.  Raise your hand if you know whether you have mud on your face.&quot;  The children cannot see whether they have mud on their own face but can see whether their brothers have mud on their face.  Some or none of the children raise their hands.  The father repeats his statement.  By the third time he repeats the statement all the children have raise their hand. 

Suppose only one child has mud on his face.  In this case the child with the mud will see that his brothers are clean and will know that he is the child with mud on his face and he will thus raise his hand the first round.  His two brothers, seeing this will see that he was able to discern that he was able to figure out whether he had mud on his face the first round and thus will know that he is the only child with mud on his face and be able to raise their hands.

Suppose two children have mud on their faces. In this case two of the children will see one brother who is clean and one who has mud on his face, and one child will see both of his brothers have mud on their faces.  The first time the father answers the question none of the children raise their hand.  Because of this each of the muddy children know that the situation cannot be as described in the previous paragraph and they will know that they each have mud on their faces.  The clean child, seeing that they were able to discern this will know that he is clean.

Suppose all the children are muddy.  In this case they will each see two brothers with dirty faces.  In the first round nobody raises their hand.  In the second round nobody raises their hand because the situation in the previous paragraph doesn't hold.  In the third round all the children raise their hand because the only remaining possibility is that they all have muddy faces.

What is interesting about this is that no new information is being conveyed directly by the fathers statement after he says it the first time.  It is only through reasoning about the knowledge of the other brothers that they are able to come to correct conclusion.

A great many logical systems have been concocted to try to address these situations.

===Non-monotonic Logics===
====Default Reasoning====
====Circumscription====
====Truth-Maintenance====

While Australia is a young nation, its development over a period of little more than two centuries has been rapid and remarkable.

This book is a social, cultural, political, economic, and military history of Australia covering the nation's history from the continent's pre-European era through to the present day. It focuses on the early history of the Colonies and key events in their history prior to Federation, as well as each of the decades - since Federation - to the present day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">PANPSYCHISM

The section on Pan-psychism is dreadful, it doesn't actually explain what pan-psychism is, it's written in a style that's barely lucid, much of it is spent on ( apparently) musing about why you are reading it, it claims that panpsychism represents some kind of mystical magical awareness, as far as I can tell it's original research, it's style of referencing and quotation is confusing, you cannot tell what is being quoted and what the author himself is saying. Because it contains no valuable content we might as well delete it. It's either vandalism or the work of someone who has decided that this text book is the right place to put his own, rambling, incoherent, mainfesto. 

Here's a sample.

If you are here, reading about panpsychism, then it may be because you still have no clue as to what consciousness is. Or, you have read philosophers say ' Without consciousness the Mind-Body problem would be much less interesting, with consciousness it seems hopeless' T. Nagel, ' What it's Like to be a Bat'. You may have reached this section rationally, logically. It follows the previous section, you are reading linearly. Basically you are thinking and acting scientifically/ philosophically. Or, you may have read &quot; Panpsychism &quot; and thought ' strange, flaky, interesting '. You are following your feelings, and close behind are your intuitions. This kind of thinking could be called Magical thought. There is more than one way to be aware of the world. Although a panpsychic might say consciousness is everything, it is not every where the same thing. It has an infinite number of aspects, forms and patterns. We arrive at panpsychism intuitively, by following our feelings. Science and philosophy represent one kind of awareness, one aspect of consciousness.Magical thinking is another aspect of consciousness. &quot; ...intuitions are important and that even if expressed vaguely they can serve as useful pointers to those seeking a more complete account of the mind&quot; David Skrbina, ' Panpsychism in the West ' p.3.

THE INTRODUCTION

Sounds awfully like original research, and not very helpful or accurate original research at that. 


Thank-you, whoever you are, for your comments on, and censorship of, my attempt to present an alternative approach to understanding  consciousness. Please understand, that in order to approach this problem from a different perspective, I had to seperate myself from the status-quo. I am the black sheep. I am like the black man or the Muslim or even the guy down the street from you who does'nt mow his lawn. Why would I think that anything I have to say would fit into your psychological filing system, conform to your way of doing things. What I have attempted to do is to find a middle ground. A space where a dialogue could begin. Perhaps you have created that space, I don't know, we will see what happens. You say, whoever you are, that the style is barely lucid. Well, that's the point. If we are all thinking like you, using scientific/ philosophic rationality, we get to say we don't have a clue as to what consciousness is. If I can alter your expectations and patterns of thought, I have a chance of providing you with the varying experiential aspects of consciousness. If you experience that, you go a long ways toward understanding consciousness. It is only after releasing the firm grip that the theoretical construct of science has on your mind can I then begin to explain how others have come to understand consciousness in quite a different way. The concept  'magic' is meant to release within the reader, their intuitions and feelings about what consciousness is. This is not original research, it reflects ideas that are present in Eastern religious tradition, in current questions about the interpretation of quantum physics and current attempts to reconcile the two. You know, it's like trying to reconcile Israel with Palestine, reconcile immigrants with citizens. Israel and Palestine have made no progress, can we?[[User:Shamantics|Shamantics]] 20:53, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

If you feel you need to save the world from what you see as predatory pseudo-intellectuals, go ahead, burn the book (I mean entry). But if you want to engage in a dialogue about how you feel the idea of 'Consciousness as Everything' should be formatted and styled, then I'm open to suggestions. (see below for how Robin H and I proceeded) But like the Phoenix, it will return.     [[User:Shamantics|Shamantics]] 20:53, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

I am including 4 new, and hopefully suitably acceptable references, to this topic. It is my intention to re-write that which was so uncerimoniously deleted, with or without a dialogue with whoever it was that censored it.[[User:Shamantics|Shamantics]] 18:50, 24 April 2006 (UTC)


 I would like to ask Robin H, &quot; How I can get access to my original text?&quot;[[User:Shamantics|Shamantics]] 18:50, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
------------------------

I temporarily cut the section on magic, this was added by user (? - please get an ID).
It was cut for three reasons:

1. If the magical conception of consciousness is inexplicable AND it involves a belief that realist explanations are fruitless it should be in the new section on Idealism, religion etc. 

2. If the magical conception considers that realist explanations of consciousness are not fruitless then, if explicable, it is clearly part of the &quot;Identity theory of mind&quot;, if inexplicable is part of mysterianism. A separate entry is not required but entries could be made in the section on scientific theories (with references to published work) or as a brief aside under mysterianism, if applicable.

3. This is a textbook on consciousness and the entry on magical conception of consciousness makes no reference to its background or work by other authors.

If the user who contributed the section edits the page they will find the text that they entered is still there, commented out, ready for transfer or amendment.

Reply: What you have done in your criticism was to try to place what I wrote into the framework of  a tradition you believe in but which I do not. That  probably accounts for your difficulty in trying to place what I wrote in a 'section'.The  Wikibook idea is to  &quot; think free&quot;. Yet, you attempt to constrain this discussion to an 'acceptable' text format. I don't get it.  And this part you will probably not get: Since we are all one, there is no need to reference other works or other authors.You want to put authors and references, go ahead, I choose not to.  Do we actually get to promote free and different ways of thinking in the Wikibook or is that just a myth? Transcend your intellect, consider the possibility of listening to your intuition and your feelings. Then we can engage in a co-operative, free and open discussion.   Please put my section on magic back.

:I did not remove your article but made it invisible while we have this discussion. I am happy for your section on magic to be in the book but it needs to go in the right place. Placing it in the introduction, for instance, would be entirely inappropriate. In your text you proposed that:

:&quot;Instead of taking energy as simple let's make consciousness simple and consider the possibility of deriving energy from consciousness.&quot; 

:This is a form of &quot;idealism&quot; (see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/ ) and is also closely related to Buddhist &quot;consciousness-only&quot; philosophy (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness-only ). The key issue here is whether, like in Buddhism, you feel that the magical conception is central and material things are illusions or whether you feel, as Descartes pointed out, that even though everything is consciousness science can still be defined as the relationships within experience.  If you feel that the magical conception has the characteristics of Buddhist &quot;consciousness-only&quot; then your article should go in &quot;Idealism, religion and panpsychism&quot;, if science emerges from the consciousness then the article should really go in &quot;scientific theories&quot;. 

:My own feeling is that the article should go in &quot;Idealism, religion and panpsychism&quot;. You wrote:

:&quot;How do we know that energy and consequently matter itself are not aware in some simple way. There is some sense in saying electrons are aware of protons and negative electrical charges  are aware of and in some simple way, know when a negative or positive charge is nearby.&quot;

:This is clearly panpsychism (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism ). Panpsychism is detached from the mainstream scientific/philosophical approach, as you note above when you say:

:&quot;What you have done in your criticism was to try to place what I wrote into the framework of a tradition you believe in but which I do not.&quot;

:The perfect position for your article is in:
:Consciousness studies: Other explanations#Panpsychism | Panpsychism
:: Position of panpsychism changed - see discussion below.[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:57, 22 September 2005 (UTC)
:preferably as a subheading of ==A magical conception==. A further advantage of being placed in that position is that it would allow expansion into a coverage of shamanism (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism ) and the occult perspective (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult )

:What do you think?

:On the other point, as a textbook we are seeking to inform readers, this means putting articles in the context of other people's ideas on the subject and providing links to allow further study. The wider you can cast your net the better. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:03, 21 September 2005 (UTC)


2nd reply: I recognise that what you are saying makes sense. Yes, there are connections to Buddhist cosmology, Idealism (for ex. Leibniz's monads) and panpsychism. Certainly I believe there is  some truth in these views. I will follow your suggestion and look at the links you provided. My concerns: 1) Buddhism is considered a religion and seperate from science. 2) You say panpsychism is detached from science/philosophy. 3) I have spent some time looking at the objections to Idealism and have determined that the views I express are not susceptable to those criticisms. You can see my problem. I am not looking to exclude other perspectives but seek to be inclusive. I think it is possible to embrace both science and religion, in fact I believe we have an obligation to do so. The 'tradition' I wish to create is unifying, not the exluding tradition you seem to be expressing. How can I include you in that larger perspective. I have tried to persuade Bernard Baars, Thomas Ramsoy in a course I took with them, and the people that edit the consciousness discussion at the Univ. of Houston and have failed to penetrate their armour, I have been excluded. I thought, given the Wiki phil. of &quot;think free&quot; I would be able to act towards creating a different discussion. Please consider the possibility of making the magical approach, one based in feelings and intuition and grounded in science and philosophy more inclusive and not an isolated &quot;section&quot;. Labeling the approach I take as Idealism, religion or panpsychism relegates it to the ontological status of those general categories. For example, O.K., so it's Idealism. Well, that position has already been refuted or it has nothing interesting left to say. Or, it's just religion, I don't believe in God or the afeterlife, so anything this has to say is irrelevant to what I believe.  A magical conception of C is new, different and far more complete than any similar theories. Don't label it, cultivate it. Please put my section on magic back.

:At this stage in the book it will be necessary to rearrange headings, sections etc. Perhaps I am fault here for placing ideas that are not current in the mainstream journals off to one side. What you are proposing is definitely panpsychism and the suggestion that consciousness is fundamental and science can be built upon this is frequently proposed in panpsychist theories (See http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/). Perhaps we should put all the explanations of consciousness in one section. However, as a textbook this would require contributors to flesh out the links between their version of a theory and other similar theories in that section. Would you be willing to fill in the details of panpsychism? The details would be split over 3 sections, for instance, in the &quot;Historical Review&quot; there should be some mention of Thales, Spinoza, Schopenhauer etc. In the &quot;Problem of Consciousness&quot; there is a stub available for idealism (what the world would appear like to an idealist, the problems with this). Finally the various current theories of panpsychism could be covered in the Contemporary Explanations. To summarise, what I am suggesting is that panpsychism is moved to contemporary theories, that historical information about panpsychists is placed in the Historical Review section, that the basic reasons why people have thought that panpsychism and idealism account for empirical consciousness is put in the Idealism section of Problems of Consciousness and finally a panpsychism section is added to contemporary theories. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:44, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

reply: I am pleasently surprised by your constructive attitude. Thank-you. If you reallign the headings, I will endeavor to fill in the details as you suggest.
:The ideas of each famous sage who supported panpsychism can be added under the sage's name in the historical review.

Concerns; First, the de Anima reference is 425b 17 and the Whitehead ref. source is &quot;Process and Reality&quot;. Is this the best way to communicate? I recently posted an entry on Homer and then withdrew it. If you are interested, I have some questions about posting entries. I think the issue is the same as that raised by the 'Intelligent Design' debate. There are a group of people, the academic establishment, who seem to have the reponsibility of preserving what humans have been able learn thru science and philosophy. That's fine, I understand that. But new ideas or ideas that are not acceptable to them are excluded just as I have been excluded. The case in point here is the difficulty for persons like myself to express themselves in such a way as to be included in the discussion. I just want to participate. But I can't because of things like the rules for adding entries to Wikibooks, previous publication in academic journals etc. If I want to talk different here or in a university class I am excluded ( and believe me, it has happened more than once), if I want to be included I must act and work in a way contrary to what I believe. A brief search on panpsychism will soon reveal that most websites are by individuals outside the mainstream of accepted academic criteria.   The bit I wrote on Homer contains references to published academic writings but their interpretation and it's connection to panpsychism was mine. Where are we to get the &quot;panpsychic perspective' if everyone that writes about it is excluded?  I am not the only person with this concern. Ken van Cleve, who maintains a website on panpsychism,  noted the same problem to me in an e-mail exchange. I know from reading an editorial in the Journal of Consciousness Studies that scientists risk their careers by bringing up  what have been called ' flaky theories'. Frankly, I don't see why this is not some illegal form of discrimination. Just like a black man wants to sit at the lunch counter, I  want to participate. It will be interesting to see how the &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; case before the Pennsyslvania courts plays out.

:I think this textbook is a good place to bring out the case for panpsychism but, being a textbook, it has to be done by a mixture of quotations from work by recognised authors (such as the Pythagoreans, Thales, Spinoza and Leibniz) and adding your own interpretation of this work. Even Chalmers in &quot;The Conscious Mind&quot; considers the case for consciousness in a thermostat. If you had access to a textbook that gave a full, historical account of panpsychism you would be in a much stronger position.  Perhaps you can draw together the work of panpsychic philosophers and scientists to provide the missing textbook, the springboard for others who take this approach?

&amp;lsaquo;&lt;small&gt; [[Australian History/1980s|The Entrepreneurial Eighties]]&lt;/small&gt;

If Australia during the 1990s could be summed up in three terms, those terms would perhaps be &quot;Economic Rationalism&quot;, &quot;Reform&quot;, and &quot;Backlash&quot;. In the wake of the entrepreneurial excesses of the 1980s, the 1990s were a decade which saw economic terms including &quot;globalisation&quot;, &quot;outsourcing&quot;, &quot;downsizing&quot; and &quot;corporate restructure&quot; enter everyday speech. The move from Keynesian economics to economic rationalism - a form of neoclassical economics which became increasingly popular during the decade - touched on many aspects of Australian social and political life. Many industries traditionally run by the public service - including telecommunications, public transport, electricity, gas, and major infrastructure works - were either privatised, corporatised, outsourced, or moved into private-public partnerships. Attempts were made to amalgamate several smaller Melbourne-based AFL teams, many major Australian corporations underwent restructuring, and Australian banks closed branches and increased fees (in spite of record profits). 

But the changes and reforms in Australia during the 1990s were not merely political and economic. Technological changes, and debates about Australias national identity and culture, were also important forces during the decade. Culturally, these debates and reforms covered a broad array of topics, including relations and reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, Australia's foreign relations with its Asian neighbours and America, immigration, and the republic debate. Beyond the cultural debates, Australians were the recipients of a range of new media technologies (including the internet, pay television, and an increasing percentage of Australian households owning computers).

But the story of Australia cannot be understood in terms of economic and social reform alone, for there were countless examples of public backlash to these sometimes controversial reforms. The grass roots campaign against the amalgamation of football teams in Melbourne; election losses for the reformist governments of political figures like Keating, Kennett, and Greiner / Fahey; the rise of Hansonism;  the S11-S13 protests in Melbourne; and the growth of home loan originators (in competition to the bank) could all be interpreted (in part) as part of a popular backlash which emerged in response to the decade's reforms.

The 1980s have been described by some as a decade of excess. Australian entrpreneurs including Alan Bond, and Christopher Skase would rise to prominence and acclaim during the decade when &quot;greed was good&quot;. However, the excesses would end following the 1987 Stockmarket Crash, and the recession which followed in its wake. It was also a decade which, under the Hawke / Keating Federal Government, saw significant economic reforms, which would continue into the [[Australian History/1990s|1990s]].

&amp;lsaquo;&lt;small&gt; [[Australian History/1940s|Back to World War II]]&lt;/small&gt;

The decade following the Second World War set in motion a number of significant events whose implications would shape the decades to come. Labour shortages would see a dramatic rise in postwar migration from outside the Anglo-American world. 

Australia's longest serving Prime Minister, Sir [[wikipedia:Robert Menzies|Robert Menzies]], would begin his second term (at the helm of the newly formed Liberal Party), and Australians would experience a prolonged period of economic prosperity as a product of 'the long boom'. 

The [[wikipedia:Snowy River|Snowy River Scheme]] provided low-paid work for many immigrants to Australia at this time.  

It would be a significant decade for sport and technology too, with Melbourne hosting the 1956 Olympics, and the first television telecasts which went along with it.

‹&lt;small&gt; [[Australian History/Early Explorers|Back to Early Explorers]]&lt;/small&gt;

Perhaps the most famous explorer of Australia was Captain James Cook.

==Early life==
James Cook was born in relatively humble circumstances at Marton in North Yorkshire, near what is today recognised as the town of Middlesborough. Cook was one of five children born to a local woman and a Scottish immigrant farm labourer, Grace and James Sr. As a child, Cook moved with his family to a farm at Great Ayton where he was educated at the local school, his studies financed by his father's employer. At 13 he began work with his father, now as the farm's manager.

In 1745 when he was 16, Cook left home to be apprenticed in a grocer/haberdashery in the fishing village of Staithes. According to tradition, it was there that Cook first felt the lure of the sea, while gazing out the shop window.

After about a year and half in Staithes, the shop owner, a Mr. Anderson, apparently finding the young James unsuited to the trade, took him to the nearby port town of Whitby and introduced him to prominent local shipowners and Quakers, John and Henry Walker. Their business was involved in the coal trade, and Cook was taken on as a merchant navy apprentice in their small fleet of vessels plying coal along the English coast. His first assignment was aboard the collier Freelove, and he spent several years on this and various other coasters sailing between the Tyne and London.

For this new apprenticeship, Cook applied himself to the study of algebra, trigonometry, navigation, and astronomy, skills he would need one day to command his own ship.

His three-year apprenticeship completed, Cook began working on trading ships in the Baltic Sea. He soon progressed through the merchant navy ranks, starting with his 1752 promotion to Mate (officer in charge of navigation) aboard the collier brig Friendship. In 1755 he was offered command of this vessel, but within the month he volunteered for service in the Royal Navy.

The Kingdom of Great Britain was re-arming for what was to become the Seven Years War, and Cook saw his opportunities for career advancement more readily to come from military service. This necessitated however starting over in the naval hierarchy, and on June 17 he began as an able-bodied seaman aboard HMS Eagle under the command of Captain Hugh Palliser. He was very quickly promoted to Master's Mate.

==Cook's First Voyage==
In 1766, the Royal Society hired Cook (then a Lieutenant in the R.N.) to travel to the Pacific Ocean to observe and record a transit of Venus across the Sun. In command of HM Bark Endeavour, he sailed from England in 1768, rounded Cape Horn and continued westward across the Pacific to arrive at Tahiti on April 13, 1769, where the observations were to be made. The transit was scheduled to occur on June 3, and in the meantime he commissioned the building of a small fort and observatory.

The astronomer appointed to the task was Charles Green, assistant to the recently-appointed Astronomer Royal, Nevil Maskelyne. The primary purpose of the observation was to obtain measurements which could be used to more accurately calculate the distance of Venus from the Sun. If this could be achieved, then the distances of the other known planets could be worked out based on their relative orbits. On the day of the transit observation, Cook recorded:

:*&quot;Saturday 3 rd This day prov'd as favourable to our purpose as we could wish, not a Clowd was to be seen the Whole day and the Air was perfectly clear, so that we had every advantage we could desire in Observing the whole of the passage of the Planet Venus over the Suns disk: we very distinctly saw an Atmosphere or dusky shade round the body of the Planet which very much disturbed the times of the contacts particularly the two internal ones. D r Solander observed as well as M r Green and my self, and we differ'd from one another in observing the times of the Contacts much more than could be expected...&quot;

Disappointingly, the separate measurements of Green, Cook and Solander varied more than the anticipated margin of error. Their instrumentation was adequate by the standards of the time, but the resolution still could not eliminate the errors. When their results were later compared to those of the other observations of the same event made elsewhere for the exercise, the nett result was not as conclusive or accurate as had been hoped.

Once the observations were completed, Cook then departed in order to execute the secondary purpose of his voyage: namely, to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated southern continent of Terra Australis. The Royal Society, and especially Alexander Dalrymple, believed that it must exist, however Cook had his own personal doubts on the subject. With the help of a Tahitian named Tupaia, who had extensive knowledge of Pacific geography, Cook managed to reach New Zealand, becoming only the second European in history to do so (behind Abel Tasman over a century earlier, in 1642). Cook mapped the complete New Zealand coastline, making only some minor errors (such as calling Banks Peninsula an island, and thinking Stewart Island/Rakiura was part of the South Island). He also discovered Cook Strait, which separates the North Island from the South Island, and which Tasman had not seen.

==Cook sets sail for Australia==
He then set course westwards, intending to strike for Van Diemen's Land (present day Tasmania, earlier sighted by Tasman) in order to establish whether or not it formed part of the fabled southern continent. However, they were forced to maintain a more northerly course owing to prevailing gales, and sailed onwards until one afternoon when land was sighted, which Cook named Point Hicks. Cook calculated that Van Diemen's Land ought to lie due south of their position, but having found the coastline trending to the south west, recorded his doubt that this landmass was connected to it. This point was on the south eastern coast of the Australian continent, and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline. In his journal, Cook recorded the event thus:

:* &quot;the Southermost Point of land we had in sight which bore from us W1/4S I judged to lay in the Latitude of 38°..0' S° and in the Longitude of 211°..07' W t from the Meridion of Greenwich. I have named it Point Hicks, because Leuit t Hicks was the first who discover'd this land&quot;.

The ship's log recorded the date as being Thursday April 19, 1770; however, Cook had not made the necessary adjustments when they had earlier crossed the 180th meridian of Longitude, and the actual calendar date was Friday, April 20. The landmark of this sighting is generally reckoned to be a point lying about half-way between the present-day towns of Orbost and Mallacoota on the south eastern coast of the state of Victoria. A later survey done in 1843 ignored or overlooked Cook's earlier naming of the point, giving it the name Cape Everard. On the 200th anniversary of the sighting, the name was officially changed back to Point Hicks.

The Endeavour continued northwards along the coastline, keeping the land in sight and Cook charting and naming landmarks as he went. A little over a week later, they came across an extensive but shallow inlet, and upon entering it moored off a low headland fronted by sand dunes. It was here, on April 29 that Cook and crew made their first landfall on the continent, at a place now known as Kurnell. At first Cook bestowed the name Stingaree (Stingray) Bay to the inlet after the many such creatures found there; this was later changed to Botanist Bay and finally Botany Bay after the unique specimens retrieved by the botanists Banks, Solander and Spöring.

This first landing site was later to be promoted (particularly by Joseph Banks) as a suitable candidate for situating a settlement and British colonial outpost. However, almost eighteen years after this first landing, when Captain Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet arrived in early 1788 to establish an outpost and penal colony, they found that the bay and surrounds did not live up to the promising picture which had been painted. Instead, Phillip shortly thereafter gave orders to relocate to a harbour a few kilometres to the north, which Cook had named Port Jackson but had not further explored. It was in this harbour at a place Phillip named Sydney Cove that the settlement of Sydney was established. The settlement was for some time afterwards still referred to generally as Botany Bay.

At Cook's original landing contact was made with the local Australian Aborigine inhabitants. The expedition's scientific members commenced the first European scientific documentation of Australian fauna and flora.

Cook continued northwards, charting along the coastline. A mishap occurred when the Endeavour ran aground on a shoal of the Great Barrier Reef, on June 11, 1770. The ship was seriously damaged and his voyage was delayed almost seven weeks while repairs were carried out on the beach (near the docks of modern Cooktown, at the mouth of the Endeavour River). While there, Joseph Banks, Herman Spöring and Daniel Solander made their first major collections of Australian flora. The crew's encounters with the local Aboriginal people were mainly peaceable; from the group encountered here the name &quot;kangaroo&quot; was to be entered into the English language, coming from the local Guugu-Yimidhirr name for a Grey Kangaroo, which was gangaroo.

Once repairs were complete the voyage continued, eventually passing by the northern-most point of Cape York Peninsula and then sailing through Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Vaez de Torres in 1604.

At that point in the voyage, Cook had lost no men to scurvy, a remarkable and practically unheard-of achievement in 18th century long-distance sea-faring. He forced his men to eat such foods as citrus fruits and sauerkraut — under punishment of flogging if they did not comply — although no one yet understood why these foods prevented scurvy. Unfortunately, he sailed on for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, to put in for repairs. Batavia was known for its outbreaks of malaria, and, before they returned home in 1771, many in Cook's crew would succumb to the disease and other ailments such as dysentery, including the Tahitian Tupaia, Banks's Finnish secretary and a fellow scientist Herman Spöring, astronomer Charles Green, and the illustrator Sydney Parkinson. Cook had named the Spöring Island on the coast of New Zealand to honour Herman Spöring and his work on the voyage.

==Aftermath of the Voyage==
The Endeavour, his ship on this first voyage, would later lend its name to the Space Shuttle Endeavour, as well as the Endeavour River.

Cook's journals were published upon his return, and he became something of a hero among the scientific community. Among the general public, however, the aristocratic botanist Joseph Banks was a bigger hero. Banks even attempted to take command of Cook's second voyage, but removed himself from the voyage before it began.

== Going to the exam ==
Before you do your first test, take a break.  You must be a good mental condition before going into an exam.  Avoid studying two hours or less before the exam. Arrive on time to the exam, make sure you have as much time as you need.  Make sure you have all needed materials, such as pen, pencil, or calculator.  Put on a positive attitude, and go in, you are ready to pass the examination, you just have to do some paperwork.  Make sure you're adequately rested, and don't consume caffeine unless to stay conscious.  Caffeine will scatter your thought, but also keep your eyes open if needed.

== Let's begin ==
If it's a small class and the professor is proctoring the exam, sit as close to him as possible, you'll see why later.  Once you get the exam, read it over completely before you begin.  Identify the easier questions, and the harder ones.  Start with the easier ones.  Pay attention to the content that each question is evaluating.  Most tests try to cover the material evenly, so this might give you a clue about how solve some of the questions on which you are not sure how to solve.  

For example, let's take a Calculus exam where you need to solve several integrals.  If you solved one using using substitution, most likely the other ones will require different methods, such as integration by parts.  Don't rule out any possibility, but having a mental checklist of material that has been evaluated by the different questions might give you a clue.

== Asking questions ==
If you have a doubt, don't ask a classmate, try to ask the professor directly.  That's the one person from whom you can get a reliable answer.  Some professors answer questions, some don't; but it's worth a try.  In order to get the best possible answer, do as much of the question as possible, even if wrong, and then ask.  That will increase your chances of a useful clue.  If you are sitting next to the professor, you might be able to hear some answers to other students' questions.  Again, that's best source of information.

Don't copy from somebody else.  Even if you don't get caught, the person you are copying might be more confused than you.  It's not a good chance to take.  In the worst case, the person next to you might have a similar but different test.  And you might find out only after you get your test back.

== Scope out the location ==
Always scope out the exam location. If it is the room that you take your class in, then this step is probably already done. However, if your college exam is in a different building, it's important to go there, find you seat and see if there's anything wrong with it. If you don't do this you could be taking a final in a broken seat or under a broken light, or simply on a wrong-handed desk. This will help you find your seat on exam day, and familiarizes you with challenges that you might panic about otherwise, like tiny desks or temperature issues.

== Practice on the Internet ==
Depending on your course material, often online tests can be found if you search the web a little. Keywords are ''U.S. history quizzes'' or ''U.S. History tests'' or ''Practice Calculus problems''. Finding these quizzes online take some time. 

If you're interested in U.S. History quizzes: :http://www.funtrivia.com/quizzes/history/us_history.html
Other quizzes in different subjects can be found online.

Many people create websites for AP student to practice his or her knowledge on a quiz. Many of these quizzes can be found online. The Internet is a goldmine.

==Specific tips and hints==
There are several tips that apply to specific types of exams:

==Notation==
This appendix summarises the notation used in the book. An effort was made to use common conventions in the notation. However, since many conventions exist the reader might see a different notation used in other books.

;Point
A point will be named by an uppercase letter in italics, as in the point ''A''. In some equations though, it will look like this: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

;Line segment
We will use the notation &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; for the line segment that starts at ''A'' and ends at ''B''. Note that we don't care about the segment direction and therefore &lt;math&gt;\overline{AB}&lt;/math&gt; is similar to &lt;math&gt;\overline{BA}&lt;/math&gt;.

;Angles
We will use the notation &lt;math&gt;\angle{ABC}&lt;/math&gt; for the angle 
going from the point ''B'', the intersection point of the segments &lt;math&gt;\overline{BA}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes the angle may also be represented by a lowercase letter or even a number, but this is only used in the main text for ease and not in the exercises.

;Triangles
A triangle whose vertices are ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' will be noted as &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt;. Note that for the purpose of triangles' congruence, the order of vertices is important and &lt;math&gt;\triangle ABC &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\triangle BCA &lt;/math&gt; are not necessarily congruent.

;Circles
We use the notation &lt;math&gt;\circ A,\overline{BC} &lt;/math&gt; for the circle whose center is the point '''A''' and its radius length equals that of the segment &lt;math&gt;\overline{BC}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that in other sources, a circle is described by any 3 points on its circumference, ''ABC''. 
The center, radius notation was chosen since it seems to be more suitable for constructions.

;External links

If you are interested seeing an example of past notation, you might be interested in [http://www.sunsite.ubc.ca/DigitalMathArchive/Euclid/byrne.html Byrne's edition of Euclid's Elements]. See for example the [http://www.sunsite.ubc.ca/DigitalMathArchive/Euclid/bookI/images/bookI-1.html equilateral triangle construction].

==Director of Photography==
The Director of Photography (or DP) is in charge of the actual image of a film project. They direct the camera/grip/lighting crews as to how the lights should be placed, how the camera should be exposed, and basically anything related to the film image. They will also choose the film stock and processing for the film. Many times the DP will be present during color timing as well. The DP works very closely with the Director to realize his vision of how the film should look.
{{Infobox person

| death_date =
| death_place =
| nationality =
| other_name =
| occupation =
| years_active = 
| spouse =
| children =
| parents =

}}


==Camera Operator==
The Camera Operator does just that - operates the camera. Many times the DP of a film will also operate on a one camera shoot. In some countries, however, the DP is not allowed to operate the camera, thus the need for a camera operator.

==First Assistant Camera==
The first assistant Cameraman (or 1st AC) is in charge of the actual camera and related equipment. He/She must always stay with the camera. The 1st AC is also known as the focus puller. The 1st AC's job includes working with the DP and Camera Operator to choose the equipment to be used on the production, unpacking and setting up the camera and related equipment, setting the T-stop, shutter, camera speed, checking the lense, pulling focus, giving the 2nd AC footage readings from the camera at each take, as well as many other camera related jobs.

==Second Assistant Camera==

==Clapper/Loader==
This person writes the info given to them by the script supervisor then slates it when camera and sound are rolling. Between shots they load 35mm film or put it away. This is an entry level position, often internship.

'''Cinematography''' is the creation of motion picture images. It can involve the use of film or digital imagery, usually with a movie camera. It is closely related to the art of still photography. Many additional technical difficulties and creative possibilities arise when the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.

==Subtopics==
There are many aspects and subtopics of Cinematography, some of these include:

===The Camera===
{{further|Movie_Making_Manual/Cinematography/Camera|l1=The Camera}}
The guide referenced above contains features in cameras that you should look for in different price ranges. These ranges include:
* Low Budget (&lt;$1,200)
* Mid Budget ($1,200-$10,000)
* High Budget ($10,000+)
'''NB: This is not a complete list of cameras.'''

===Moving the Camera===
{{further|Movie_Making_Manual/Cinematography/Moving_the_camera|l1=Moving the Camera}}
Moving the camera can be one of the best ways to portray emotion within cinematography. Some of the ways to move a camera include:
* Handheld
* Dolly / Slider
* Jib / Crane
* SteadiCam
* Shoulder Rigs
* Copters

===Filtration===
{{further|Movie_Making_Manual/Cinematography/Filtration|l1=Filtration}}
The use of filters or polarizers during filming can be essential or highly recommended to achieve a certain style. Some quick examples include:
* Neutral Density (Graduated) Filters
* Linear and Circular Polarizers
* Ultra Violet Filters

===Aspect Ratio===
{{further|Movie_Making_Manual/Cinematography/Aspect_ratios|l1=Aspect Ratio}}
Aspect ratio is the width:length ratio of an image. What aspect ratio is best to shoot in, or is it better to shoot anamorphic? Common aspect ratios include 16:9 and 2.35:1.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often what people believe to be SPECIAL EFFECTS (SPFX) are computer generated VISUAL EFFECTS (VFX). This confusion results from the final products of both departments looking similar.
Visual effects may involve computer animations, green or blue screen compositing or other post effect work. VFX may highlight or multiply the SPFX shots to create a much larger explosion for example.

#[[Movie Making Manual/Visual Effects]]

'''Introduction to Special Effects for film'''

SPFX Technician Dean Campbell states that &quot;special effects are basically any on-screen physical effect that is not done by the actor&quot;.  
This can mean atmospheric effects such as smoke, wind, rain, haze or simulated conditions such as boiling pots, exploding cars or campfires.

This also includes any movement of objects in front of camera such as falling dishes, floating furniture or breaking glass.

Often the PROPS DEPARTMENT will claim to do special effects, however under IATSE regulations props are items used or touched by the actor.

Concerning situations that call for department overlap, the above guidelines still apply; for example if a scene calls for an exterior shot of a snow covered street with gently falling flakes it would be the responsibility of the set dresser and greens department to dress in snow, but the responsibility of the special effects department to create the falling snow effect.

There are several ways to find your way around this book:

*  If you want a &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;fast overview&lt;/font&gt; for the entire filmmaking process, look at [[Movie_Making_Manual/The_Basic_Basics | The Movie Making Manual's ''Basic Basics'']].

* Now there are &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;general overviews&lt;/font&gt; which briefly explain all the steps for an area.

:* For Production, the overview is at [[Movie_Making_Manual/Production_Overview  |Movie Making Manual's ''Production Overview'']]. 

:* For Post-Production, the overview is at [[Movie_Making_Manual/Post_Production_Overview  |Movie Making Manual's ''Post Production Overview'']].    (Hopefully, overviews will be written for the other sections soon.)

* To get started &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''learning''' filmmaking&lt;/font&gt;, look at [[Movie_Making_Manual/Education | Movie Making Manual's section on ''Education'']].

* You could use the [[Movie Making Manual|table of contents on the front page]].  The links on the right in small type are just a selection of the total pages available.  The links on the far left (e.g. [[:category:funding and budgetting|Funding and budgeting]]) will take you to a table of contents for that category.  These lists-of-pages-within-a-category are automatically produced so they are a little ugly but they do have the advantage that they contain every single page within that category (as compared to the manually-produced front page which only contains a small selection of the complete set of pages)
* Alternatively, you could use the [[:category:Movie Making Manual|hierarchically organised contents page]].  By following the links to the sub-categories, you can access every single page in the book.

Please be aware that [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia]] has a lot of film related information.  Useful Wikipedia categories are:
* [[w:Category:Video_and_movie_technology|Video and movie technology]]
* [[w:Category:Film_techniques|Film techniques]]
* [[w:Category:Film_production|Film production]]

Also be aware that [[v:Wikiversity:Main_Page|Wikiversity]] has a section on learning filmmaking which is just getting started.  The first course in filmmaking is at:
* [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Course:WikiU_Film_School_Course_01_-_Learning_the_Basics_of_Filmmaking Wikiversity Course #01 - ''Learning the Basics of Filmmaking]

&lt;b&gt;Passive/Subjunctive Tenses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Passive is used to describe something like an indirect action affects you - an example is &quot;I was being held&quot;. In Latin, it is conjugated through six parts - the present set (present, imperfect, future), and the perfect set (perfect, pluperfect, future perfect). Below is a chart you can use for endings and such.

The present tense through future tenses use the present stem. I'm using the word amo, amare, amavi, amatus - to love, so the present stem is &quot;am&quot;.

''All functions are global (i.e. a function cannot contain another function. This is why C is not a traditional block-structured language).''

That's not true. Try compiling:
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
 int main (void)
 {
 	void hw (void) {
 		printf (&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;);
 	}
 	hw();

:It is true for Standard C (i.e. ANSI/ISO C). Try compiling your code with gcc using &lt;code&gt;-Wall -ansi -pedantic&lt;/code&gt; and you will get:

== Don't teach the wrong usage of printf ==

This page uses the famous &lt;code&gt; printf (&quot;hello, world\n&quot;) &lt;/code&gt; which is the source of all trouble with format string bugs. Please do not teach people that printf is a &quot;function that prints its argument&quot;. Use something like &lt;code&gt; printf (&quot;%s&quot;, &quot;hello, world\n&quot;) &lt;/code&gt;. If you don't want to explain printf at this point, use &lt;code&gt; puts (&quot;hello, world&quot;) &lt;/code&gt;. -- [[User:131.130.38.57|131.130.38.57]] 15:03, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

: I'm not sure of your point here. Why is the example the &quot;source of all trouble with format string bugs&quot;? The specification says that &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; writes output to &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;, under control of the string pointed to by its first argument that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output. In the &quot;Hello, world\n&quot; case, the only formatting required is the translation of &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; into a newline, all other characters are copied to &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;. -- [[User:Mickraus|Mickraus]] 12:51, 29 October 2007 (UTC)

== Scope ==

The concept of scope can be a little confusing at first, perhaps this should be moved to a later section? I'm going to add in some examples to help people understand the idea now, but someone might want to move the section somewhere else.

==What is Description?==

The goal of description is to convey a person, place or thing in such a way that a picture is formed in the reader’s mind. Capturing an event through descriptive language involves paying close attention to details by using all of your five senses (touch, sight, smell, taste, and sound). These senses are important to descriptive writing because they help the reader understand what the author is trying to say.  As a descriptive writer, the more vividly you are able to describe what you have sensed, the more engaged audience will be with your text.  

Grammatically speaking, descriptive language is the use of nouns and adjectives in order to most specifically describe the experiences of a particular sense. By making the language you use more powerful, you may use description in order to allow your reader to truly sense what you are writing about. To this end, one of description's main goals is making the abstract seem more concrete.  

Specific descriptive language has uses outside of describing sensory experience. For example, the abstract idea of freedom may help many evoke different definitions and feelings for different readers, but when the idea of freedom is described to slaves through the Emancipation Proclamation, it becomes much more concrete and more uniform among readers.  Description is used by writers in order to encourage their audiences to have a more specific reading of a text.

==Why Write a Descriptive Essay?==

A descriptive essay allows writers to engage their reader through the use of specific language and imagery. If the writer is trying to convey something that is scary or exciting, a concrete description is usually more effective than a vague or abstract one.  These concrete descriptions create specific, vivid images in readers' imaginations. Think of a descriptive essay as being similar to writing a movie. At no time can a movie show beautiful. It must show what 'beautiful' is through the use of images.

A writer usually begins an essay with an objective.  If a writer wanted to persuade the reader that ice cream is a tasty treat, what are descriptions that could cause the reader to want to eat ice cream?  Would ''sweet'' sound appetizing?  Would comparisons to other foods, such as a cherry, be used to convince the reader that the ice cream is worth trying?  When you have begun to think in this fashion, then you are ready to start your essay.

==Abstract Descriptions Versus Concrete Descriptions==

Try to avoid vague, abstract descriptions.  For example, a writer may write ''beautiful'' to describe a tree.  However, ''beautiful'' is too vague.  Instead, a concrete adjective or modifier would be stronger and gives greater impact.  The reader needs details for a picture to form in their heads, abstract concepts like ''beautiful'' lack a real-world analog.
Here's a reworked description of the tree: &quot;the sun's rays glistened off the rain-slick leaves, even as the afternoon sky dipped towards evening.&quot;  The ''beautiful'' qualities of the tree are &quot;shown&quot; through concrete details instead of merely told through abstraction.  This gives the reader the illusion of immediate experience, as opposed to the dictionary variety
==== Abstract Descriptions ====
[[File:American_Eskimo_Dog_2.jpg|thumb|How would you use concrete language to describe this &quot;cute&quot; dog?]]

Abstractions are often ideas that cannot be seen, heard, touched, or smelled.  

Examples of abstract descriptions:
* the sad man
* the happy woman
* the beautiful dog
* a lovely house
* an amazing sight

==== Concrete Descriptions ====

A concrete description can be seen, heard, touched, or smelled.

Examples of concrete details:
* the crunching sound
* the melted candy cane
* the burnt toast
* the flashing light
* the smooth butter

There are appropriate times to use abstractions.  For instance, if the reader is already aware of the circumstances (i.e., a writer is referring to a passage from a novel, in which the audience knows of a certain event) then the writer can generalize the emotion.  However, especially in creative works such as fiction and poetry, it is best to turn the abstract into the concrete.

==Similes and Metaphors==

Another way to add descriptive language is to use similes and metaphors, creating a picture in readers' heads by comparing two objects to one another. Similes and metaphors help to make connections between two ideas, concepts, or objects that clarify or give new meaning. 

A simile is a comparison using the words like or as. It usually compares two dissimilar objects. For example, the bread was as dry as a bone. The comparison links a piece of bread that has become hard and white to a bone that is also hard and white. Bones often dry out, and so does bread. These similar characteristics are what make the simile effective. 

A metaphor states that one thing is something else. It is a comparison, but it does NOT use like or as to make the comparison. For example, the athlete's stomach was a bottomless pit. The comparison implies that the athlete's stomach will not fill up easily or quickly. The athlete can eat lots of food. 

To make a simile or metaphor, identify an object like a sunset, tree, or river, or a concept like love, peace, or anger. Then think of another object that has some similar traits. Decide whether the words &quot;like&quot; or &quot;as&quot; will help make the connection more understandable. A good simile or metaphor will make the reader look at both objects in a new perspective.  

By adding similes and metaphors to a description paper, the writer can appeal to the readers' imagination and make the writing more interesting to read. Similes and metaphors add spark to descriptions.

== How to Write Description ==

In order to write descriptively, you must take a topic and decide how to make that topic vivid for your audience.  If the topic of the piece is merely to describe a particular place, you must decide what elements of that place, when described in text, will become most vivid for your audience.  The first step in any descriptive writing is to choose a topic and begin to work out a thesis statement.  As was suggested in the previous sections, you may choose to describe a particular place.

=== Thesis ===
Sample Thesis Statement:
''Although Minnesota may seem drab and cold to outsiders, natives of the state find it a wonderful place to live.''

We can see in this thesis statement that the writer will attempt to show the aspects of Minnesota that make it a great place to live.  After detailing a thesis statement, you should come up with a list of sensory words that provide vivid detail and support the thesis.  You may start by thinking about the five senses.  How does your particular place look, smell, feel, taste, and sound like?  How can you best describe these senses so the reader feels what you feel?  By organizing the elements of descriptive language into easier to handle sections, like the five senses, you are able to more specifically engage in what elements of the description are most useful.

== Examples of Sensory Words ==

==== Examples of Sound Imagery ====
*Quiet solitude
*Grasshoppers chirping at night
*Trees rustling in the wind
*The howl of a wolf
*Birds singing        
*Leaves crunching
*Fire crackling

==== Examples of Smell Imagery ==== 
*Chlorine at a pool
*Freshly cut grass
*Flowers in spring
*Morning dew,
*Freshly baked banana bread,
*Acrid-campfire smoke.

==== Examples of Touch Imagery ====
*Cold, wet snowflakes falling on your nose
*Corse sandpaper
*Rough, dry tree bark
*Wet sand beneath your feet
*Hot pan on the stove

==== Example of Visual Imagery ====
*The brilliant rays of sunset
*The churning blue waterfall
*Powerful deer racing across the field
*Clean snow falling softly in the sun
*Corn stalks rustling in the breeze

==== Examples of Taste Imagery ====
*Lutefisk or lefsa during the holidays
*Steaming, bitter black coffee
*Fresh, succulent strawberries
*Crunchy chocolate chip cookies
*Cotton candy, sweetly melting in your mouth

After deciding what senses you wish to invoke, make a list of all the words you wish to include.  You should also begin to plan a way to present the information that will drive home the thesis statement in the most profound way.

== Order of Presentation ==

The writer in this case could choose to present the positive aspects of Minnesota in terms of the seasons and weather changes.  The details could be presented linearly, starting with spring and going through the winter, highlighting the aspects of each season that most closely support the thesis, that Minnesota is a great place to live.

Prior to starting the essay, give some thought as to whom the audience of your piece will be.  Who is going to read the essay, and what effect would you like it to have upon them?  An awareness of audience is important to choosing the level of formality you take with your writing.  Knowing your audience will also help you distinguish which details to include throughout your essay.  Assume that your audience knows very little or nothing about your subject matter, and include details that may seem very obvious to you.

=== Audience ===
Example Audience:
In this particular essay, the writer wants to show an outsider to the state why Minnesota natives are so happy to live there.  The essay should help break down stereotypes for those outsiders about Minnesota's cold weather and apparent drabness.  Because the essay is designed for those who do not live in Minnesota, and maybe have never been there, it is important to include details about the state that may seem obvious to a native.

With the preparatory work complete, it is time now to begin writing your essay.  Use your thesis statement to begin to construct an introductory paragraph.  The introduction should set up the basis for your essay, and the thesis statement should state its purpose.

=== Introduction ===
Example Introduction:
''Many who have not traveled to the state of Minnesota only hear of its cold weather and boring reputation.  They are sure missing out on the great opportunities that Minnesota affords.  Each season offers different senses that native Minnesotans and tourists know and love.  Although Minnesota may seem drab and cold to outsiders, natives of the state find it a wonderful place to live.''

With the introduction complete, it is time to start constructing the body paragraphs of your essay.  Each body paragraph should have a central theme in itself, and that theme should be represented in a topic sentence.  Consequently, each sentence of the paragraph should relate to and support the topic sentence.  The body paragraphs are where the majority of the details should be given.  When writing the first draft of your descriptive essay, include as many details as is reasonably possible.  You can always eliminate the ones that do not serve the essay as well when you are revising your draft.  In the case of the Minnesota nature essay, we have decided to set up the body paragraphs in terms of season, starting with spring.

=== Body ===
Example Body Paragraph:

''Spring in Minnesota brings new life to the state after the long winter season.  The rain washes the landscape clean, leaving its fresh aroma for all to enjoy.  The flowers soak up the golden sun's rays and begin to show their vibrant colors.  The first birds can be seen and  heard throughout the woods and fields, telling their stories in beautiful songs.  The lakes begin to show their glossy finish as the ice melts away slowly under the heat of the season.''

With the body paragraphs complete, it is time to bring the essay to a close with the conclusion.  The conclusion should return back to the thesis and provide coherence to the essay.  The conclusion should restate the main points of the essay in order to give the reader a final sense of what the essay was meant to portray.  There should not be any new material introduced in the conclusion, and the way it is worded should give the reader a sense of finality.

=== Conclusion ===
Example Conclusion:

''By examining what each of the seasons in Minnesota has to offer, it becomes clear that the state is a truly wonderful place to live or visit.  Minnesota is much more than the cold and drab state that many people give it credit for.  One visit to the state and anyone can see the great things about Minnesota.''

With the essay complete, it is time to reread and revise your essay (also see revision sections of this textbook).  Read your first draft and pinpoint all of the descriptor words you used.  If possible, go back and add more after the ones you already used in the essay.  If you can, read your essay out loud to a friend and have them tell you what images are vivid for them and what images are a little more cloudy.  Rework any images that are cloudy with more descriptions.  Also check to see if your descriptions have made use of all of the five senses: sound, smell, texture, sight, and taste.  Repeat these steps as many times as necessary until you are happy with your product.

==A Second Sample Descriptive Essay ==

=== First Draft ===
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=In recent years, many of St. Cloud's residents have congregated to Waite Park's stores and businesses for entertainment.  However, people who focus their attention entirely on the flashy Crossroads Mall or the giant Parkwood 18 theater are depriving themselves of the fun and tradition of downtown St. Cloud.  The downtown bars, stores, and restaurants provide a rich experience that is unlike all others in Minnesota.

Downtown St. Cloud's bars are always overflowing with cheek-stretching smiles, live music, and professionally made beverages.  The Tavern on Germain boasts a cozy environment with drinks such as Vodka Sours and Captain Cokes.  However, if one is tired of drinking the night away, he/she can go next door for live music ranging from the acoustic-guitar stringing of Leonard Mills to the horn-blaring excitement of Test Tube and the Tuba Players.

Entertainment is not unique to the over twenty-one crowd, especially when visitors can stop by coffee houses such as the Java Joint and the Meeting Grounds.  Relax with friends while dining on coffee cakes and drinking them down with cappuccinos.  As the laughter of your group erupts, and your nose inhales the aroma of coffee beans and melting chocolate, it becomes easier to take those few extra minutes for a lunch break.

When dinner time arrives, the options of the hungry people are plentiful.  Cheese melts while sausage sizzles on the crust of pizza at the House of Pizza.  When hungry individuals take a taste of the pie from the House, it melts in a mouth with layers of tickling pepperoni.  If pizza is not what's in a person's mind, order a burger at the Green Mill or devour a calzone.  Either one will gladly fill an empty stomach.

When dinner concludes, one can travel to some of the shops.  Drum beats pound like gorilla dance moves at the Electric Fetus.  From the slipperiness of the CD cases featuring covers with Pete Townshend driving his hand across the strings of his guitar, or other records with Mariah Carey singing on the windy stage, a music lover finds it all the Electric Fetus.

From music to tasty treats, St. Cloud's residents can find all that they desire downtown.  Choose it instead of an over-crowded mall.  It is meant for exploration, and with a little digging, anyone can find what they are looking for.

=== Second Draft ===
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=In recent years, many of St. Cloud's residents have congregated to Waite Park's stores and businesses for entertainment. However, people who focus their attention entirely on the Crossroads Mall or the Parkwood 18 theater are depriving themselves of the fun and tradition of downtown St. Cloud. The downtown bars, stores, and restaurants provide a rich experience that is unlike all others in Minnesota.

For those who seek quiet conversations and steaming-hot drinks to start off your day, downtown St. Cloud can provide them with cozy coffee houses like the Meeting Grounds.  Inside, groups of friends unwind with frosted coffee cakes, and individuals with books and newspapers recline with a new mug of cappuccino.  As the sun rises in the back of the Meeting Grounds, visitors inhale the aroma of coffee beans and melting chocolate, and it becomes easier for them to take a few extra minutes before leaving for work.

As those work days dip into evenings, hungry downtown patrons, with their stomachs growling in unison, march to any one of the many eateries.  Mexican Village spreads the aroma of spices and peppers rolled into a tortilla wrap with thick cuts of beef down the street.  However, not to be outdone, House of Pizza strolls out its smell of pepperoni that tickles the nose, but then sends a message to the mouth that says, &quot;Come this way.&quot;   A wind gust brushes through the downtown area carrying the Green Mill's calzone aroma, which leaves those hungry patrons without an easy answer.

With their stomachs filled, downtown patrons wander down the street to the retail shops.  Some of the customers step into the Electric Fetus where the drums beat like avalanches, and the songbirds are in flight with microphones pressed against their lips.  Further north, another sound rattles through each person's eardrum: the flipping of smooth pages from Books Revisited, where used literature is sold, stacked, then discovered by bookworms digging through each level.  Books may be flipped and songs may blare, but shoes scuff the tile floor of Herbergers—a two-story department store where jewelry and clothing are yanked from the rack just as quickly as they are hung on.

The sun sets and the moon rises, but that just means that St. Cloud's downtown bars will be overflowing with cheek-stretching smiles, wall-shaking music, and lip-licking beverages. The Tavern on Germain rapidly serves drinks such as Vodka Sours and Captain Cokes to customers sitting at their table. Along with the constant guzzling, he/she can go next door for live music ranging from the acoustic-guitar stringing of Leonard Mills to the horn-blaring excitement of Test Tube and the Tuba Players.

Whether their hands are sorting through thin page of paperback books, or their mouths are chewing on the gooey cottage cheese of lasagna, downtown patrons are always on the go to the next hot spot.  As the customers reach the end of the downtown St. Cloud district, most are ready to turn around and visit all the stops again.  St. Cloud is bustling with retailers that will cause anyone's eyes to take a second glimpse.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Old English}}
What are '''adjectives'''? They are words used to describe either [[Old English/Nouns|nouns]] or [[Old English/Pronouns|pronouns]]. Like nouns and pronouns, they are declined according to number, gender, and case; and their number, gender, and case must always agree with the noun or pronoun that they are modifying. In addition, adjective are also declined in either of two ways: strong or weak. This is governed by certain factors, for which should see the section on the question [[Old English/Nouns#Strong or Weak?|&quot;Strong or Weak?&quot;]] bellow.

==Strong Declension==
Adjectives in Old English agree with the noun they describe in case, gender, and number.  There are several variations on the general declension, but overall, adjectives decline thus:

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;4&quot;|'''Singular'''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; |'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Masculine'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Neuter'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Feminine'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || - || - || -(u)
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || -ne || - || -e
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || -es || -es || -re
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || -um || -um || -re
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || -e || -e || -re
|}

Notice that the genitive, dative, and instrumental feminine are all ''-re'', the masculine and neuter genetive are both &quot;-es&quot;, and masculine and neuter dative are both &quot;-um&quot;, and masculine and neuter instrumental are both &quot;-e&quot;. Also, the neuter adjective adds no ending in the nominative/accusative case, just like neuter nouns themselves.  Basically, you can see that the adjective ending will roughly correspond to the article ending (''þæs'' and ''-es'', ''þǣm'' and ''-um'', ''þǣre'' and ''-re', etc.).

Here's an example:

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;4&quot;|'''&quot;Gōd&quot; - &quot;good&quot;'''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; |'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Masculine'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Neuter'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Feminine'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || gōd || gōd || gōd
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || gōd-ne || gōd || gōd-e
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || gōd-es || gōd-es || gōd-re
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || gōdu-m || gōd-um || gōd-re
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || gōd-e || gōd-e || gōd-re
|}

In the plural, we find:

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;7&quot;|'''Plural'''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; |'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Masculine'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Neuter'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Feminine'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || -e || -(u) || -a, -e
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || -e || -(u) || -a, -e
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || -ra || -ra || -ra
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || -um || -um || -um 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || -um || -um || -um

Notice that genitive and dative are the same in all genders for plural. Note also the the instrumental is exactly the same as the dative. The &quot;-e&quot; ending for nominative and accusative feminine was used in later Old English.

Here's an example of the plural:

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;4&quot;|'''&quot;Gōd&quot; - &quot;good&quot;'''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; |'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Masculine'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Neuter'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Feminine'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || gōd-e || gōd || gōd-a, gōd-e
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || gōd-e || gōd || gōd-a, gōd-e
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || gōd-ra || -ra || -ra
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || gōd-um || gōd-um || gōd-um 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || gōd-um || gōd-um || gōd-um 
|}

===Adjectives with æ in the stem===

If an adjective has a monosyllabic stem and has æ for its vowel, and the æ is followed by a single consonant, as in the words glæd (&quot;glad&quot;) and blæc (&quot;black), then an extra rule comes into play: the æ changes to an a whenever the adjective acquires a suffix which begins with a vowel.

For example, here is the strong declension of glæd.

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;7&quot;|'''Example of the Strong Adjective Declension: glæd 'glad' '''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Masculine'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Neuter'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Feminine'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Plural'''
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Plural'''
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || glæd || glade || glæd || gladu || gladu || glade
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || glædne || glade || glæd || gladu || glade || glade
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || glades || glædra || glades || glædra || glædre || glædra
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || gladum || gladum || gladum || gladum || glædre || gladum
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || glade || gladum || glade || gladum || glædre || gladum
|}

There is no need to supply the weak declension, since in the weak declension every suffix begins with a vowel.

===Adjectives with -w===

We shall give ġearu (&quot;ready&quot;) as an example of this type of adjective. Here is the strong declension:

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;7&quot;|'''Example of the Strong Adjective Declension: gearu 'ready' '''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Masculine'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Neuter'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Feminine'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Plural'''
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Plural'''
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || ġearu || ġearwe || ġearu || ġearu || ġearu || ġearwe
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || ġearone || ġearwe || ġearu || ġearu || ġearwe || ġearwe
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || ġearwes || ġearora || ġearwes || ġearora || ġearore || ġearora
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || ġearwum || ġearwum || ġearwum || ġearwum || ġearore || ġearwum
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || ġearwe || ġearwum || ġearwe || ġearwum || ġearore || ġearwum
|}

This again can be explained in terms of a few simple rules:

* Where the ordinary strong declension has ''no'' suffix, -w adjectives have the suffix -u.
* Where the ordinary strong declension has a suffix beginning with a consonant, -w adjectives have an o followed by the appropriate suffix.
* Where the ordinary strong declension has a suffix beginning with a vowel, -w adjectives have a w followed by the appropriate suffix.

There is no need to give the weak declension, since in the weak declension every number and case has a suffix beginning with a vowel; -w adjectives will therefore uniformly precede this suffix with a w.

===Adjectives with -e===

Adjectives such as swēte (&quot;sweet&quot;) follow a very simple rule: the e at the end is displaced by any suffix, but stays where it is if there is no suffix. Hence the strong declension looks like this:

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;7&quot;|'''Example of the Strong Adjective Declension: swēt &quot;sweet&quot; '''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Masculine'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Neuter'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;|'''Feminine'''
|-

| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || swēte || swēte || swēte || swētu || swētu || swēte
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || swētne || swēte || swēte || swētu || swēte || swēte
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || swētes || swētra || swētes || swētra || swētre || swētra
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || swētum || swētum || swētum || swētum || swētre || swētum
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || swēte || swētum || swēte || swētum || swētre || swētum
|}

Again, there is no real need to give the weak declension — or the strong one, really, since the rule is so simple.

==Weak Declension==

Here's the singular weak declension:

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;4&quot;|'''Singular'''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; |'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Masculine'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Neuter'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Feminine'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || -a || -e || -e
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || -an || -e || -an
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || -an || -an || -an
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || -an || -an || -an
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || -an || -an || -an
|}

Notice that the weak declension is much more uniform and simple than the strong declension. Notice also that it is exactly the same as the weak noun declension.

Here's an example of the singular:

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;4&quot;|'''Singular'''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; |'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Masculine'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Neuter'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''Feminine'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || gōd-a || gōd-e || gōd-e
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || gōd-an || gōd-e || gōd-an
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || gōd-an || gōd-an || gōd-an
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || gōd-an || gōd-an || gōd-an
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || gōd-an || gōd-an || gōd-an
|}

Here's the plural weak declension:

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;7&quot;|'''&quot;Gōd&quot; - &quot;good&quot;'''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; |'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''All genders'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || -an 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || -an
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || -ena
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || -um 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || -um
|}

Notice again that: It is simpler than the strong declension; it is exactly the same as the weak noun declension; and it is exactly the same for all genders.

Here's an example of a weak plural adjective:

{| border=1 style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px #333 solid; border-collapse:collapse;&quot;
! style=&quot;background:#fd8;&quot; colspan=&quot;7&quot;|'''&quot;Gōd&quot; - &quot;good&quot;'''
|-
! style=&quot;background:#e74;&quot; |'''Case'''
! style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot; |'''All genders'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Nominative''' || gōd-an 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Accusative''' || gōd-an
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Genitive''' || gōd-ena
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Dative''' || gōd-um 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#fed;&quot;|'''Instrumental''' || gōd-um
|}

==Strong or Weak?==
You can tell when to use the strong or weak declension.

An adjective would be declined weak if: 
#It was always declined weak (like most ordinal numbers, and all comparative adjectives)
#It was preceded by the definitive article (&quot;se/sēo/þæt&quot; and all its declined forms), either of the demonstratives (&quot;se/sēo/þæt&quot; and all its declined forms and &quot;þes/þis/þēos&quot; and all its declined forms), or any possessive personal pronoun except for the third person possessive pronouns (&quot;his/hire/heora&quot;) - unless the adjective was one of the few adjectives that were always declined strong, like ''ōðer'' - &quot;second&quot;
#It was used in a nickname and came after the personal name it modified (for more info see: [[Old English/Titles and Nicknames]]

In all other cases, the adjective was declined strong, including if it came after a linking verb:
*''Iċ eom grēat'' - &quot;I am great&quot;
*''Þā wihta wǣron fǣtta'' - &quot;The creatures were fat&quot;).

==Comparatives and Superlatives==
The comparative and superlative forms are like Modern English &quot;more&quot; and &quot;most&quot;, as is &quot;more intelligent&quot; and &quot;most intelligent&quot; or &quot;better&quot; and &quot;best&quot;.

In Old English, all comparative adjectives were declined according to the weak declension - no matter what. The comparative degree was usually formed with the suffix &quot;-ra&quot; (the &quot;a&quot; being the weak masculine singular ending - so it should be replaced by other grammatical endings when it is declined). The superlative degree (&quot;most&quot;) was usually formed by adding the suffix &quot;-ost&quot; to an adjective; but like the normal positive degree, it was sometimes declined weak and sometimes declined strong (see the &quot;Strong or Weak?&quot; section above for more information). For example:

*wīs (&quot;wise&quot;) - wīsra (&quot;wiser&quot;) - wīsost (&quot;wisest&quot;)
*cræftiġ (&quot;crafty, skilled&quot;) - cræftiġra (&quot;craftier, more skilled&quot;) - cræftigost (&quot;craftiest, most skilled&quot;)
*hefiġ (&quot;heavy, important&quot;) - hefiġra (&quot;&quot;heavier, more important&quot;) - hefigost (&quot;heaviest, most important&quot;)

Some common adjectives undergo i-mutation in the comparative and superlative, and have -est instead of -ost as the superlative suffix. Examples are:

* eald (&quot;old&quot;) - ieldra (&quot;older&quot;) - (ieldest)
* ġeong (&quot;young&quot;) - ġingra (&quot;younger&quot;) - ġingrest (&quot;youngest&quot;)
* hēah (&quot;high&quot;) - hīerra (&quot;higher&quot;) - hīehst (&quot;highest&quot;)
* strang (&quot;strong&quot;) - strengra (&quot;stronger&quot;) - strengest (&quot;strongest&quot;)
* lang (&quot;long&quot;) - lengra (&quot;longer&quot;) - lengest (&quot;longest&quot;)

Some adjectives formed their comparative and superlative degrees irregularly, and need to be memorized:

*gōd (&quot;good&quot;) - betera (&quot;better&quot;) - betst (&quot;best&quot;)
*yfel (&quot;bad, evil&quot;) - wirsa (&quot;worse&quot;) - wirst (&quot;worst&quot;)
*lytel (&quot;little, small&quot;) - læssa (&quot;smaller, less&quot;) - læst
*miċel (&quot;much, great&quot;) - māra (&quot;more, greater&quot;) - mǣst (&quot;most, greatest&quot;)

==Adjectives and Cases==
Sometimes adjectives in Old English can govern cases, like prepositions. We do a similar thing in Modern English, but we usually use prepositions instead of cases; for example, the adjective &quot;full&quot; can be followed by the preposition &quot;of&quot;, plus whatever something is &quot;full of&quot; - &quot;The swimming pool was full of slime&quot;.

===Adjectives Governing the Dative===
*Ġelīċ - like, similar to
**''Hē þūhte ġelīċ hunde'' - &quot;He seemed similar to a dog&quot;
*Midsprecende - speaking on behalf of
**''þū þe wǣre midsprecende þǣm Hǣlende'' - &quot;you who were speaking on behalf of the Lord&quot;

===Adjectives Governing the Genitive===
*Full - full (of)
**''Þæt fæt wæs full wæteres'' - &quot;The container was full of water&quot;

The leaders walk forwards and the follower walks backwards, in normal salsa
timing, keeping within the circle.  This is done in the initial position (men facing anti-clockwise).

Arriba can also be used (like [[Rueda de Casino/Abajo|abajo]] can) to affect other moves.

For example, [[Rueda de Casino/Enchufa|enchufa]] de arriba means that when you change partners, you move one forwards instead of backwards (more specifically, you move to the follower who is next, anti-clockwise).

Another obvious example is [[Rueda de Casino/Adios|adios]] de arriba.
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;
This move is from the initial position (leaders facing anticlockwise).

The leader lifts his left arm and passes underneath it to the next follower,
anticlockwise.  After un tarrito, continue with the move you were doing
before, e.g., para el medio, arriba or abajo.

It can often help if the caller calls out the previous move again, just so that leaders don't forget.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Effects Pedals''' are electronic devices that modify the tone, pitch, or sound of an electric guitar. Effects can be housed in effects pedals, guitar amplifiers, guitar amplifier simulation software, and rackmount preamplifiers or processors. Electronic effects and signal processing form an important part of the electric guitar tone used in many genres, such as rock, pop, blues, and metal. All these are inserted into the signal path between an electric instrument and the amplifier.  They modify the signal coming from the instrument, adding &quot;effects&quot; that change the way it sounds in order to add interest, create more impact or create aural soundscapes.

Guitar effects are also used with other instruments in rock, pop, blues, and metal, such as electronic keyboards and synthesizers. Electric bass players use bass effects, which are designed to work with the low-frequency tones of the bass. 

==Distortion-related effects==
[[Image:DS 1 Distortion.jpg|thumb|right|Boss DS1 distortion pedal]]
Distortion is an important part of an electric guitar's sound in many genres, particularly for rock, hard rock, and metal. A distortion pedal takes a normal electric guitar signal and combine harmonic multiplication and clipping through the use of analog circuitry to create any number of sounds ranging from a fuzz sound to the sound of an overdriven tube amp and beyond! Distortion is essential to Heavy [[Guitar/Metal|Metal]] Music. 

There are several different types of distortion effects, each with distinct sonic characteristics. These include overdrive/distortion (or vacuum tube-style distortion), overdrive/crunch, fuzz, and hi-gain.

===Overdrive Distortion===

Overdrive distortion is the most well known of all distortions.  Although there aren't many electronic differences between a distortion an overdrive, the main audible one is that a distortion does exactly as the name suggests; distorts and clips the signal no matter what volume is going through it, the amount of distortion usually remains relatively the same. This is where an overdrive differs. Most overdrives are built to emulate the sound of a tube amp overdriving and therefore give the player control of the clipping through dynamics. This simply means that the effect gives a clean sound for quieter volumes and a more clipped or distorted sound for louder volumes. 

While the general purpose is to emulate classic &quot;warm-tube&quot; sounds, distortion pedals such as the ones in this list can be distinguished from overdrive pedals in that the intent is to provide players with instant access to the sound of a high-gain Marshall amplifier such as the JCM800 pushed past the point of tonal breakup and into the range of tonal distortion known to electric guitarists as &quot;saturated gain.&quot; Although most distortion devices use solid-state circuitry, some &quot;tube distortion&quot; pedals are designed with preamplifier vacuum tubes. In some cases, tube distortion pedals use power tubes or a preamp tube used as a power tube driving a built-in &quot;dummy load.&quot; Distortion pedals designed specifically for bass guitar are also available. Some distortion pedals include: 

* MXR Distortion+: A distortion which is capable of having a very subtle, soft clipping, right through to a heavily overdriven sound favoured by many modern day heavy and death metal guitarists.
* Pro Co Rat
* Boss DS-1 Distortion
* Marshall Guv'nor
* Line 6 Dr. Distorto
* T-Rex Engineering|T-Rex Engineering's Bloody Mary
* Digitech Hot Head
* Danelectro FAB Distortion



===Overdrive/Crunch ===
[[Image:Ts9-stompbox.jpg|thumb|right|Ibanez Tube Screamer pedal]]

Some distortion effects provide an &quot;overdrive&quot; effect. Either by using a vacuum tube, or by using simulated tube modeling techniques, the top of the wave form is compressed, thus giving a smoother distorted signal than regular distortion effects. When an overdrive effect is used at a high setting, the sound's waveform can become clipped, which imparts a gritty or &quot;dirty&quot; tone, which sounds like a tube amplifier &quot;driven&quot; to its limit. Used in conjunction with an amplifier, especially a tube amplifier, driven to the point of mild tonal breakup, short of what would be generally considered distortion or overdrive, these pedals can produce extremely thick distortion sounds much like those used by Carlos Santana or Eddie Van Halen. Today there is a huge variety of overdrive pedals, and some of them are: 
* Ibanez Tube Screamer (TS-9 and TS-808): an overdrive which was built to work with the harmonics of a push-pull tube amp. This effect was made famous by blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan but was and is used by hundreds of prominent guitarists since it's invention.
* BOSS SD-1 Super Overdrive
* BOSS BD-2 Blues Driver
* BOSS OD-3 Overdrive
* Line 6 Crunchtone
* DigiTech Bad Monkey
* N-audio Firesound V3
* Danelectro FAB Overdrive

===Fuzz===
Fuzz was originally intended to recreate the classic 1960's tone of an overdriven tube amp combined with torn speaker cones. Oldschool guitar players (like Link Wray) (citation needed) would use a screwdriver to poke several holes through the paperboard part of the guitar amp speaker to achieve a similar sound. Since the original designs, more extreme fuzz pedals have been designed and produced, incorporating octave-up effects, oscillation, gating, and greater amounts of distortion.

Some fuzzbox pedals include: 
* Z.Vex Fuzz Factory
* Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face: This was a favorite of Psychedelic rocker Jimi Hendrix who shot this pedal to stardom as he did himself.
* Electro Harmonix Big Muff: Probably the most popular fuzz effects ever invented, the Big Muff is also often used as a sustain pedal and sounds excellent in combination with a wah wah. 
* BOSS FZ-5 Fuzz
* Danelectro Cool-Cat Fuzz

===Hi-Gain===
Hi-Gain (descended from the more generic electric guitar amplification term high-gain) is the sound most used in heavy metal. High gain in normal electric guitar playing simply references a thick sound produced by heavily overdriven amplifier tubes, a distortion pedal, or some combination of both--the essential component is the typically loud, thick, harmonically rich, and sustaining quality of the tone. However, the Hi-Gain sound of modern pedals is somewhat distinct from, although descended from, this sound. The distortion often produces sounds not possible any other way. Many extreme distortions are either hi-gain or the descendents of such. The Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier Series of amps are an example.

Some Hi-Gain Pedals Include: 
*BOSS MT2 Metal Zone
*DigiTech Death Metal
*Danelectro FAB Metal
*Electro Harmonix Metal Muff with Top Boost
*MXR Dime Distortion: Used by Dimebag Darrell.
*Suhr Riot

===Power-tube pedal===
A Power-Tube pedal contains a power tube and optional dummy load, or a preamp tube used as a power tube. This allows the device to produce power-tube distortion independently of volume; therefore, power-tube distortion can be used as an effects module in an effects chain.

===Power attenuator===
A Power attenuator  enables a player to obtain power-tube distortion independently of listening volume. A power attenuator is a dummy load placed between the guitar amplifier's power tubes and the guitar speaker, or a power-supply based circuit to reduce the plate voltage on the power tubes. Examples of power attenuators are the Marshall PowerBrake and THD HotPlate.

==Filtering-related effects==
===Equalizer===

[[Image:Behringer EQ700.jpg|thumb|left|Behringer EQ700 graphic equalizer]]

An equalizer adjusts the frequency response in a number of different frequency bands. A graphic equalizer (or &quot;graphic EQ&quot;) provides slider controls for a number of frequency region. Each of these bands has a fixed width (Q) and a fixed center-frequency, and as such, the slider changes only the level of the frequency band. The tone controls on guitars, guitar amps, and most pedals are similarly fixed-Q and fixed-frequency, but unlike a graphic EQ, rotary controls are used rather than sliders. 

Most parametric EQ pedals (such as the [http://www.bossarea.com/loadpage.asp?file=boxes/pq4.xml] Boss PQ-4) provide semi-parametric EQ. That is, in addition to level control, each band provides either a center frequency or Q width control. Parametric EQs have rotating controls rather than sliders. 

Placement of EQ in a distortion signal processing chain affects the basic guitar amp tone. Using a guitar's rotary tone control potentiometer is a form of pre-distortion EQ. Placing an EQ pedal before a distortion pedal or before a guitar amp's built-in preamp distortion provides preliminary control of the preamp distortion voicing.

For more complete control of preamp distortion voicing, an additional EQ pedal can be placed after a distortion pedal; or, equivalently, the guitar amp's tone controls, after the built-in preamp distortion, can be used. An EQ pedal in the amp's effects loop, or the amp's tone controls placed after preamp distortion, constitutes post-distortion EQ, which finishes shaping the preamp distortion and sets up the power-tube distortion voicing. 

As an example of pre-distortion EQ, Eddie Van Halen places a 6-band MXR EQ pedal before the Marshall amplifier head (pre-distortion EQ). Slash places a Boss GE-7, a 7-band EQ pedal, before his Marshall amp. This technique is similar to placing a Wah pedal before the amp's preamp distortion and leaving the Wah pedal positioned part-way down, sometimes mentioned as &quot;fixed wah,&quot; (pre-distortion EQ), along with adjusting the amp's tone controls (post-distortion EQ).

If a dummy load guitar-amp configuration is used, an additional EQ position becomes available, between the dummy load and the final amplifier that drives the guitar speaker. Van Halen used an additional EQ in this position. This configuration is commonly used with rackmount systems.

Finally, an EQ pedal such as a 10-band graphic EQ pedal can be placed in the Insert jack of a mixer to replace the mixer channel's EQ controls, providing graphical control over the miked guitar speaker signal.

Equalization-related effects pedals include Wah, Auto-Wah, and Phase Shifter. Most EQ pedals also have an overall Level control distinct from the frequency-specific controls, thus enabling an EQ pedal to act as a configurable level-boost pedal. Some EQ pedals include: 
* MXR M-108 10-band Equalizer
* BOSS GE-7 Equalizer

=== Wah-wah ===
[[Image:Wah-wah pedal.jpg|thumb|right|Boss V-Wah pedal]]

A wah-wah pedal is a moving bandpass filter whose frequency center is controlled by the musician via a rocker pedal.  This filter boosts the frequencies in the instrument signal around the moving frequency center, allowing the musician to emphasize different areas of the frequency spectrum while playing.  Rocked to the bass end of the spectrum, a wah-wah pedal makes a guitar signal sound hollow, without upper harmonics.  On the other end of the sweep, the filter emphasizes higher-end harmonics and omits some of the low-end &quot;growl&quot; of the natural instrument sound.  Rocking the pedal while holding a note creates a sound that goes from growl to shriek, and sounds like a crying baby, which is how the effect got its name and also the reason behind the Crybaby line of wah-wah pedals. The wah-wah pedal, used with guitar, is most associated with 1960s psychedelic rock and 1970s funk. During this period wah-wah pedals often incorporated a fuzzbox to process the sound before the wah-wah circuit, the combination producing a dramatic effect known as fuzz-wah. 

Some wah-wah pedals include: 
* Dunlop Cry Baby
* VOX V847 Wah Wah
* Danelectro Trip-L Wah

===Auto-Wah / Envelope Filter===
An Auto-Wah is a Wah-wah pedal without a rocker pedal, controlled instead by the dynamic envelope of the signal. An auto-wah, also called more technically an envelope filter, uses the level of the guitar signal to control the wah filter position, so that as a note is played, it automatically starts with the sound of a wah-wah pedal pulled back, and then quickly changes to the sound of a wah-wah pedal pushed forward, or the reverse movement depending on the settings. Controls include wah-wah pedal direction and input level sensitivity. This is an EQ-related effect and can be placed before preamp distortion or before power-tube distortion with natural sounding results. Auto-Wah pedals include: 
* Electro-Harmonix Q-Tron
* MXR M-120 Auto Q
* Keeley Electronics Nova Wah
* Danelectro French Fries Auto-Wah
* Mu-Tron III

===Talk Box===
Early forms of the talk box, such as the Heil Talk Box, first appeared in Country Music circles in Nashville in the 1940',s 1950's, and 1960's, by artist like swing band pedal steel player Alvino Rey, Link Wray (&quot;Rumble&quot;), Bill West, a Country Music steel guitar player and husband of Dottie West, and Pete Drake, a Nashville mainstay on the pedal steel guitar and friend of Bill West. Drake used it on his 1964 album Forever, in what came to be called his &quot;talking steel guitar.&quot; The device used the guitar amplifier's output to drive a speaker horn that pushed air into a tube held in the player's mouth, which filters and thereby shapes the sound leading to a unique effect. The singer and guitarist Peter Frampton made this effect famous with hit songs such as &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do&quot; and &quot;Show Me the Way,&quot; as did Joe Walsh on &quot;Rocky Mountain Way.&quot; On Van Halen's cover of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; Eddie Van Halen uses a talk box after the guitar solo to make a sound similar to a person having sex. Newer devices, such as Danelectro's Free Speech pedal, use a microphone and vocoder-like circuit to modulate the frequency response of the guitar signal. Some Talk Boxes include: The Dunlop Heil Talk Box, Rocktron Banshee, and Peter Frampton's own company,Framptone.

==Volume-related effects==
===Volume pedal===
A Volume pedal is a volume potentiometer that is tilted forward or back by foot. A volume pedal enables a musician to adjust the volume of their instrument while they are performing. Volume pedals can also be used to make the guitar's notes or chords fade in and out. This allows the percussive plucking of the strings to be softened or eliminated entirely, imparting a human-vocal sound. Volume pedals are also widely used with pedal steel guitars in country music. It has also been used to great effect in rock music; the Pat McGee Band's live version of &quot;Can't Miss What You Never Had&quot; on General Admission illustrates what the pedal is capable of. Some volume pedals are:
* Ernie Ball Stereo Volume Pedal
* Boss FV-50H Foot Volume
* VOX V850 Volume Pedal

===Auto-Volume/Envelope Volume===
Just as an Auto-Wah is a version of a Wah pedal controlled by the signal's dynamic envelope, there is an envelope-controlled version of a volume pedal. This is generally used to mimic automatically the sound of picking a note while the guitar's volume knob is turned down, then smoothly turning the knob up, for a violin-like muted attack. An example is:
* Boss SG-1 Slow Gear

===Tremolo===
Tremolo is a regular and repetitive variation in gain for the duration of a single note, which works like an auto-volume knob; this results in a swelling or fluttering sound.  This effect is very popular in psychedelic and trip-hop music.  The speed and depth of the flutter are usually user-controlled.This is a volume-related effects pedal. This effect is based on one of the earliest effects that were built into guitar amplifiers. Examples include: 
* Demeter TRM-1 Tremulator
* Boss TR-2 Tremolo
* Electro-Harmonix Worm
* Line 6 Tap Tremolo
* Danelectro Cool-Cat Tremolo

===Compressor===

[[Image:CompressorED1.jpg|thumb|left|Marshall ED-1 Compressor effects pedal]]
A compressor acts as an automatic volume control, progressively decreasing the output level as the incoming signal gets louder, and vice versa. It preserves the note's attack rather than silencing it as with an Envelope Volume pedal. This adjustment of the volume for the attack and tail of a note evens out the overall volume of an instrument. Compressors can also change the behaviour of other effects, especially distortion. when applied toward the guitar, it can provide a uniformed sustained note; when applied to instruments with a normally short attack, such as drums or harpsichord, compression can drastically change the resulting sound. Another kind of compressor is the optical compressor which uses a light source (LED or lamp) to compress the signal.
 
Some compressor pedals are: 
* Boss CS-3 Compression Sustainer
* MXR M-102 DynaComp
* Line 6 Constrictor
* T-Rex Engineering's CompNova
* Electro-Harmonix Black Finger (optical compressor)
* Aphex Punch Factory Optical Compressor

==Time-based effects==
===Delay/Echo===
A Delay or Echo pedal creates a copy of an incoming sound and slightly time-delays it, creating either a &quot;slap&quot; (single repetition) or an echo (multiple repetitions) effect. Delay pedals may use either analog or digital technology. Analog delays often are less flexible and not as &quot;perfect&quot; sounding as digital delays, but some guitarists argue that analog effects produce &quot;warmer&quot; tones. Early delay devices actually used magnetic tape to produce the time delay effect. U2's guitarist, The Edge, is known for his extensive use of delay effects. Some common Delay pedals are:
* Boss DD-6 Digital Delay
* Line 6 DL-4 Delay Modeler
* Line 6 Echo Park
* T-Rex Engineering's Replica
* Boss DD-20 Giga Delay
* TC Electronic
* Danelectro FAB Echo

Another technology that is used in Delay units is a feedback circuit, consisting of a tracking oscillator circuit to hold a note of the last interval, and after amplifying the signal, send it back to the input side of the delay. While it was first associated with Boss DF-2 Super Feedbacker &amp; Distortion, currently, the signal feedback circuit is employed by Delay pedals, and if used under &quot;hold&quot; mode (As in Boss DD-3) it will provide a sustain effect instead of a simply delay effect.

===Looping===
Extremely long delay times form a looping pedal, which allows performers to record a phrase or passage and play along with it. This allows a solo performer to record an accompaniment or ostinato passage and then, with the looping pedal playing back this passage, perform solo improvisations over the accompaniment. The guitarist creates the loop either on the spot or it is held in storage for later use (as in playback) when needed. Some examples of loops effects are:
* Boss RC-300 Loop Station
* DigiTech JamMan Looper
* Boomerang Looper
* TC Electronic Ditto

===Reverb===
[[Image:DigiTech DigiDelay.jpg|thumb|right|DigiTech DigiDelay effects pedal]]
Reverb is the persistence of sound in a particular space after the original sound is removed. When sound is produced in a space, a large number of echoes build up and then slowly decay as the sound is absorbed by the walls and air, creating reverberation, or reverb. A plate reverb system uses an electromechanical transducer (actuator), similar to the driver in a loudspeaker, to create vibration in a plate of sheet metal. A pickup captures the vibrations as they bounce across the plate, and the result is output as an audio signal. A spring reverb system uses a transducer at one end of a spring and a pickup at the other, similar to those used in plate reverbs, to create and capture vibrations within a metal spring. Guitar amplifiers frequently incorporate spring reverbs due to their compact construction. Spring reverberators were once widely used in semi-professional recording due to their modest cost and small size. Due to quality problems and improved digital reverb units, spring reverberators are declining rapidly in use. Digital reverb units use various signal processing algorithms in order to create the reverb effect. Since reverberation is essentially caused by a very large number of echoes, simple DSPs use multiple feedback delay circuits to create a large, decaying series of echoes that die out over time.

Examples of reverb pedals include:
* DigiTech DigiDelay
* Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail
* Boss RV-5 Digital Reverb
* Line 6 Verbzilla

==Modulation-related effects==
===Rotary Speaker===
Before such effects are available electronically, these are accomplished by the use of Rotary speakers, by spinning the speakers and/or place a rotating baffle in front of it. This creates a doppler effect, and depend on the speed of the rotation, translate into phasing, flanging, chorus, vibrato, or even tremolo.
*Leslie Speakers: This is a unit that contains a bass speaker that blare into a rotating baffle, and a horn speaker that rotate like a siren. Originally designed for Hammond organs, they are also favored by guitarist; some say that no electronic effects can duplicate its sounds.
*Fender Vibratone: This is a simplified version of Leslie Speaker, containing only a 10&quot; speaker that blare into a rotating baffle.
All the electronic-based effects can duplicate the sound of a rotating speakers, as all the following effects differ based on speed, volume, and modulation. In fact, it is not uncommon for a pedal to be capable of doing two or more of modulation effects.

===Phase Shifter===
[[Image:HyperPhase.jpg|thumb|right|Digitech Hyper Phase effects pedal]]

A Phase Shifter creates a complex frequency response containing many regularly-spaced &quot;notches&quot; in an incoming signal by combining it with a copy of itself out of phase, and shifting the phase relationship cyclically. The phasing effect creates a &quot;whooshing&quot; sound that is reminiscent of the sound of a flying jet. This effect dominates the sound in the song Star Guitar by Chemical Brothers. The song was not played with any guitars but you can hear the phasing effect. The instrument being phased was actually a synthesizer. Some electronic &quot;rotating speaker simulators&quot; are actually phase shifters. Phase shifters were popular in the 1970s, particularly used with electric piano and funk bass guitar. The number of stages in a phase shifter is the number of moving dips in the frequency response curve. From a sonic perspective, this effect is equalization-oriented. However, it may be derived through moderate time-based processing. Some phaser pedals include: 

* MXR M-101 Phase 90
* BOSS PH-3 Phase Shifter
* Electro-Harmonix Small Stone
* Moog] MF-103 12 Stage Phaser
* DigiTech Hyper Phase

===Vibrato===
A Vibe or vibrato pedal reproduces the sound of a rotating speaker by synchronizing volume oscillation, frequency-specific volume oscillation, vibrato (pitch wavering), phase shifting, and chorusing in relation to a non-rotating speaker. The modulation speed can be ramped up or down, with separate speeds for the bass and treble frequencies, to simulate the sound of a rotating bass speaker and a rotating horn. This effect is simultaneously a volume-oriented effect, an equalization-oriented effect, and a time-based effect. Furthermore, this effect is typically related to chorus. Some vibe pedals also include an overdrive effect, which allows the performer to add &quot;tube&quot;-style distortion. This effect is the most closely related to a rotary speaker.
Some Vibe-only pedals include:
*BBE Soul Vibe
*Voodoo Lab Microvibe
Some vibe-chorus pedals include 
* Dunlop Univibe 
* Dunlop Rotovibe 
* BBE Mind Bender

===Flanger===
A Flanger simulates the sound effect originally created by momentarily slowing the tape during recording by holding something against the flange, or edge of the tape reel, and then allowing it to speed up again. This effect was used to simulate passing into &quot;warp speed,&quot; in sci-fi films, and also in psychedelic rock music of the 1960s. Flanging has a sound similar to a phase-shifter, but different, yet is closely related to the production of chorus.

The first pedal-operated flanger designed for use as a guitar effect was designed by Jim Gamble of Tycobrahe Sound Company in Hermosa Beach, CA, during the mid 1970s. Last made in 1977, the existing &quot;Pedalflangers&quot; appear occasionally on eBay and sell for several hundred dollars. A modern &quot;clone&quot; of the Tycobrahe Pedalflanger is sold by Chicago Iron.Famous users of this Flanger effect include Randy Rhoads and Eddie Van Halen, coincidentally they both used the MXR M-117R flanger and Eddie Van Halen even has his own signature model now.

Examples:
* Boss BF-3 Stereo Flanger
* Line 6 Liqua Flange
* MXR M-117R Flanger
* Danelectro FAB Flange
* Electro Harmonix Deluxe Electric Mistress

[[Image:Gitarren-Bodeneffektgerät Ibanez CF7.jpg|thumb|right|Ibanez CF7 chorus/flanger effects pedal]]

===Chorus===
Chorus splits your guitars signal in two, then second signals pitch is then delayed and/or modulated in pitch and mixed back in with the dry signal. The effect sounds like several guitarists playing the same thing at the same time resulting in a wide swelling sound. Some common chorus pedals are: 
* Boss CE-1 Chorus Ensemble (the original chorus effect pedal, and first device released by Boss)
* Boss CH-1 Super Chorus
* Electro-Harmonix Small Clone
* Ibanez CF-7 Chorus/Flanger
* Line 6 Space Chorus
* MXR M-134 Stereo Chorus
* TC Electronic Stereo Chorus /Flanger /Pitch Modulator
* Danelectro FAB Chorus

===Rotary Speaker Simulator===
Despite the numerous different analog devices, it is very rare for them to be able to duplicate all aspects of a Leslie speaker. Thus, Rotary Speaker Simulator are always going to be digital, utilizing modelling algorithms to model the relations between the rotating horns and bass baffle. And how the sound bounce around the cabinet. As Leslie also have an amplifier section, most of these typically have overdrives to simulate that aspect. Some of these pedals can even accept keyboard's input. 
*Boss RT-20 Rotary Ensemble Pedal: This is one of the few pedals that is capable of modelling all aspect of a Leslie Speaker.
*Line 6 Rotomachine: Also a modelling pedal, it is available in a compact pedal size.
*DLS Roto-Sim: Hybrid of analog with DSP modelling.

==Pitch-related effects==

===Pitch Shifter/harmonizer===
'''Pitchshifters''' change the pitch of the note played via a user-specified amount. The range of pitch deviation depends on the equipment used, but many pedals are capable of raising and lowering the pitch two [[w:Octave|octaves]] above and below the fundamental pitch. The amount of pitch deviation can be set or controlled via a foot pedal (which typically offers smooth, continuous pitch control). Typically, such function will be used with the original signal, resulting in a '''Harmonizer''': the pitch is altered and combined with the original pitch to create two or more note harmonies. These harmonies are typically programmed in discrete [[w:Integer|integer]] multiples of the fundamental tone. When used with an expression pedal, it provides a smooth, abeit slightly digital, bend-like effect. Pitch shifters can also be used to electronically &quot;detune&quot; the instrument. Some examples are: 
* Digitech Whammy
* Boss PS-5 Super Shifter
* Electro Harmonix Harmonic Octave Generator

===Octaver===
[[Image:EH POG.jpg|thumb|right|Electro-Harmonix Polyphonic Octaver Generator effects pedal]]
An Octaver mixes the input signal with a synthesised signal whose musical pitch is an octave lower or higher than the original. Effects that synthesize intervals besides octaves are referred to as harmonizers or pitch shifters.&lt;br /&gt; These are frequently used in bands without a bassist. Octave Up pedals include: 
* Ampeg Scrambler
* Electro Harmonix POG (Polyphonic Octave Generator)

Octave Down pedals include: 
* Boss OC-3 Super Octave
* Electro-Harmonix Octave Multiplexer
* MXR M-103 Blue Box

==Other effects==
===Feedbacker/Sustainer===
While audio feedback in general is undesirable due to the high frequency overtone, when controlled properly, it can provide true sustain of the sound (instead of using a distortion/compressor to make quiet notes louder, or a feedback of a signal in a circuit as in a delay unit).  Several approaches have been used to produce guitar feedback effects, which sustain the sound from the guitar:
*The most primitive form, as used by Jimi Hendrix, is to use the feedback created when the guitar is played in front of a loudspeaker.
* The neck pickup is used as a driver to push the strings based on the bridge pickup, such as the Sustainiac Sustainer and Fernandes Sustainer.
* A string driver can be mounted on a stand as in the Vibesware Guitar Resonator, which is driven by the selected guitar pickup(s). Feedback start, stop and harmonics can be controlled here by positioning the drivers distance to the strings and the position along the guitar neck while playing.
* A signal amplifier that powers a headstock transducer, which in turn send feedback vibration down the string, as in Sustainiac's Model C. 
* A handheld string driver can contain a pickup and driver, as in the [[Guitar/E-bow|EBow]]. 
* A dedicated high-gain guitar amp can be used in the control room, without a microphone, as a footswitch-controlled string feedback driver. The microphone is placed on the speaker cabinet of the main guitar amp in the isolation booth or live room.

===Switcher/Mixer (or &quot;A/B&quot; pedal)===
A switcher pedal (also called an &quot;A/B&quot; pedal) enables players to run two effects or two effects chains in parallel, or switch between  two effects with a single press of the pedal. 

Some switcher pedals also incorporate a simple mixer, which allows mixing the dry guitar signal to be mixed with an effected signal. This is useful to make overly processed effects more mild and natural sounding. Examples of the use of the mixer function include: 
*A wah can be mixed with dry guitar to make it more mild and full-bandwidth, with less volume swing. 
*A compressor can be mixed with dry guitar to preserve the natural attack of the dry signal as well as the sustain of the compressor.
*Two overdrive pedals can be blended together. 
*A strong phaser effect can be mixed with dry guitar to make it more subtle and musical. 

Some examples of switcher pedals include: 
* Dunlop A/B pedal
* Loop Master

Some examples of Switcher/mixer pedals include: 
* BOSS LS-2 Line Selector

===Noise Gate===
A noise gate allows a [[signal]] to pass through only when the signal's intensity is above a set threshold, which opens the gate. If the signal falls below the threshold, the gate closes, and no signal is allowed to pass. A noise gate can be used to control noise. When the level of the 'signal' is above the level of the '[[noise]]', the threshold is set above the level of the 'noise' so that the gate is closed when there is no 'signal'. A noise gate does not remove noise from the signal: when the gate is open, both the signal and the noise will pass through.
 
Noise gates are also used as an effect to modify the envelope of signals, removing gradual attacks and decays.

Examples of noise gate pedals include:
* BOSS NS-2 Noise Suppressor
* MXR M-135 Smart Gate

=== Boosters ===
There are three types of boosters.

The first are signal boosters. These give a gain boost to the signal running through it and appear to make the guitar louder.

The second are frequency boosters. These are similar to the signal boosters but instead of boosting the whole signal, they boost one specific frequency range.

The third are harmonic boosters. These boost certain harmonics within the wave and can sometimes give a gritty, octave sound (in either direction)

==Bass Effects==
===Sound conditioner===
Bass effects that condition the sound, rather than changing its character are called &quot;sound conditioners.&quot; Gain booster effects pedals and bass preamplifier pedals increase the gain (or volume) of the bass guitar signal. Bass preamplifiers for double basses are designed to match the impedance of piezoelectric pickups with the input impedance of bass amplifiers. Some double bass preamplifiers may also provide phantom power for powering condenser microphones and anti-feedback features such as a notch filter (see &quot;Filter-based effects&quot; section below).

Volume pedals are volume potientiometers set into a rocking foot treadle, so that the volume of the bass guitar can be changed by the foot. Compression pedals affect the dynamics (volume levels) of a bass signal by subtly increasing the volume of quiet notes and reducing the volume of loud notes, which smooths out or &quot;compresses&quot; the overall sound. Limiters, which are similar to compressors, prevent the upper volume levels (peaks) of notes from getting too loud, which can damage speakers. Noise gates remove hums and hisses that occur with distortion pedals, vintage pedals, and some electric basses.

===Bass Distortion===
Bass distortion effects preamplify the signal until the signals' waveform &quot;clips&quot; and becomes distorted, giving a &quot;growling&quot;, &quot;fuzzy&quot; or &quot;buzzing&quot; sound. Until the late 1980s, distortion effects designed specifically for electric bass' low range were not commonly available in stores, so most electric bass players who wanted a distortion effect either used the natural overdrive that is produced by setting the preamplifier gain to very high settings or used an electric guitar distortion pedal. Using the natural overdrive from an amplifier's preamplifier or a guitar distortion effect has the side effect of removing the bass' low range (low-pitched) sounds. When a low-range note is amplified to the point of &quot;clipping&quot;, the note tends to go up an octave to its second harmonic, making deep bass notes sound &quot;tinny&quot;.

In the 1990s and 2000s, bass distortion effects became widely available. These effects contained circuitry which ensured that the low-range bass signal was maintained in the distorted bass tone. Bass distortion is used in genres such as metal, thrash, hardcore, and punk.

Bass &quot;overdrive&quot; effects use a vacuum tube (or digitally-simulated tube modelling techniques) to compress the top of the signal's wave form, giving a smoother distorted signal than regular distortion effects. Regular bass distortion effects preamplify the signal to the point that it develops a gritty or &quot;dirty&quot; tone.

Fuzz bass effects are sometimes created for bass by using fuzzbox effects designed for electric guitars. Fuzzboxes boost and clip the signal sufficiently to turn a standard sine wave input into what is effectively a square wave output, giving a much more distorted and synthetic sound than a standard distortion or overdrive. Paul McCartney of The Beatles used fuzz bass on &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; in the 1966 album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;

===Filtered based effects===
Filter based effects for bass include equalizer, phase shifter, wah and auto-wah.

A '''bass equalizer''' is the most commonly used of these three effects. It adjusts the frequency response in a number of different frequency bands. While its function is similar to a tone controls on an amplifier, such as rudimentary &quot;bass&quot; and &quot;treble&quot; frequency knobs, it allows for more precise frequency changes. A rack-mounted bass equalizer, for example, may have ten sliders to control the frequency range encompassed by a regular &quot;bass&quot; frequency knob.

In comparison with an electric guitar equalizer, a bass equalizer usually has a lower frequency range that goes down to 40 Hz, to accommodate the electric bass' lower range. Some bass equalizers designed for use with extended range basses go even lower, to 20 Hz. Equalizers can be used to change the tone and sound of the electric bass. If the instrument sounds too &quot;boomy&quot;, the bassist can lower the frequency which is overly resonant, or if there is too much fingernail or pick noise, the higher frequencies can be reduced.

'''Notch filters''' (also called band-stop filters or band-rejection filters) are sometimes used with double basses. Notch filters are filters that allow most frequencies to pass through unaltered, while attenuating those in a specific range to very low levels. Notch filters are used in instrument amplifiers and preamplifiers for acoustic instruments such as acoustic guitar, mandolin, and bass instrument amplifiers to reduce or prevent feedback. While most notch filters are set manually by the user, there are also automatic notch filters which detect the onset of feedback and notch out the frequency before damaging feedback begins.

'''Bass Phase Shifters''' create a complex frequency response containing many regularly-spaced &quot;notches&quot; in an incoming signal by combining it with a copy of itself out of phase, and shifting the phase relationship cyclically. The phasing effect creates a &quot;whooshing&quot; sound that is reminiscent of the sound of a flying jet.

===Bass chorus===
'''Bass chorus''' effects use a cycling, variable delay time that is short so that individual repetitions are not heard. The result is a thick, &quot;swirling&quot; sound that suggests multiple instruments playing in unison (chorus) that are slightly out of tune. Bass chorus effects were more common in the late 1980s, when manufacturers such as Peavey included chorus effects in its bass amplifiers. In the 1990s and 2000s, more sophisticated bass chorus effects devices were created which only apply the swirling chorus effect to the higher parts of the bass tone, leaving the instrument's low fundamental untouched.[5]

==Multi-Effects unit==
A multi-FX unit is a single effects device that can perform several guitar effects simultaneously. Such devices generally use digital processing to simulate many of the above-mentioned effects without the need to carry several single-purpose units.  In addition to the classic effects, most have amplifier/speaker simulations not found in analog units.  This allows a guitarist to play directly into a recording device while simulating an amplifier and speaker of his choice. 

[[Image:BOSS GT-3.jpg|thumb|right|Boss GT-3 multi-effects unit]]
 
A typical digital multi-effects pedal is programmed, with several memory locations available to save custom user settings. Many lack the front-panel knobs of analog devices, using buttons instead to program various effect parameters.  Multi-effects devices continue to evolve, some gaining MIDI or USB interfaces to aid in programming.  Examples include:
* Tech 21 Sans Amp - A line of analog effects with distortion and speaker simulation capability.
* Line 6 POD XT Live
* Behringer V-Amp Pro
* DigiTech RP series
* DigiTech GNX series
* Boss ME-20, ME-50, GT-6, GT-8
* Zoom G2 series
* Vox Tonelab series
* Roland VG series
* Korg AX series

The quality of sound that is a major feature of separate pedals can never be matched by a multi-effects unit but they are ideal for a guitarist on a budget.

Common [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] extracts:

* '''Marmite''' is a yeast extract, extremely popular in Britain. It has a very strong, rich flavor, tasting slightly like beef stock, with a hint of salt. It is most commonly eaten spread very thinly over buttered toast.
* '''Vegemite''' is a yeast extract popular in Australia. It is made from yeast scraped out of beer barrels. This extract has a salty, slightly bittersweet flavor similar to beef bouillon. 
* '''Bovril''' is not actually yeast extract, but a cow extract; it tastes quite a bit like Marmite and has a lot of the same texture properties. It is enough like the yeasty spread that a good number of websites that have information about either Marmite or Vegemite also make it a point to mention Bovril.

==Overview of Drafting==

[[File:P_writing.svg|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]
Drafting is essential to the organization and flow of your paper.  Drafting includes [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Planning_and_Prewriting prewriting], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Editing editing], and [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Reviewing reviewing].  Once your general ideas are down on paper, writing out specific ideas and quotations can make the final writing process much easier.
Each step of drafting brings the process a little closer to the final product. Always write down any ideas you have in the drafting process.  It is much easier to cut content from your paper than it is to work on adding content. If you collect all your resources, quotations, facts, ideas, and come up with a thesis during the drafting process, your paper will show it. The idea is to provide yourself with as much information as possible in order to create a solid and well thought-out piece. Do less worrying and more writing.

== Drafting: The Process ==

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;Fiction is based on reality unless you're a fairy-tale artist. You have to get your knowledge of life from somewhere. You have to know the material you're writing about before you alter it.&quot;|caption=--Hunter S. Thompson}} 

'''The thesis''': 
[https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Rhetoric_and_Composition/Planning_and_Prewriting&amp;stable=0#Starting_with_a_Thesis_Statement] It is not advisable to begin drafting without a thesis. The thesis statement is a roadmap for your essay and at the drafting phase it will help keep you on track. Make sure that you begin with a statement (not a question) that articulates (a) your topic, (b) what you plan to say about that topic, and that at least implies (b) why what you plan to say is significant enough to be worth writing about. What causes students the most trouble is (b) what you plan to say about the topic. What you plan to say must be debatable. You should not plan to say something people already know or can easily find somewhere else. What you plan to say about your topic must be something that a reader could question, but might not after reading the essay that will follow.

'''The first draft''':
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Planning_and_Prewriting Prewriting] will help you with drafting. Additionally, try writing in full sentences, try to find the best possible quotations, try mindmapping, or try writing out all of the data you have gathered. Weave these things together, and you may end up with a nice framework for your paper. Don’t worry about being complete in your drafting. Disorganization and choppiness are fine here; you can smooth that out in later drafts. Drafts are '''not''' perfect. Drafts may contain grammatical and spelling errors and may lack detail. Rephrasing and expanding ideas may be a part of later drafts.

'''The second draft''':
The second draft is about organizing your information logically and effectively. If you created a thorough first draft, this should be easy. Organize the main points that you plan to make, find supporting evidence for each point, and spend a few sentences explaining what conclusions you are able to draw from the information. Don’t be afraid to show off. Professors like it when students are able to draw conclusions on their own. Sometimes it weakens your argument to use softeners like “might” “I think” and “maybe,” so keep an eye out for these.
 
You will want to come up with an overall organizational strategy and stick to it. Parallelism is very attractive in a paper. However, there is also no quick and easy format that works for every topic. You may want to organize things chronologically, with fact and then opinion, or by order of importance.

'''The third draft and more''':
The third and any subsequent drafts are really about finesse. These are the drafts that will hook your reader and earn you an “A.” Try to write an attention-grabbing introduction, as well as a conclusion that leaves the reader thinking about your paper. If you are still struggling with the overall flow of your paper, go back to you first draft and start rewriting. Often your main point will change by the time you get to this draft, and that is fine. However, you may need to go back to your first draft when this happens.

The elusive “show, don’t tell” line comes into play in this draft. Professors want to be entertained, and they want more than just facts.  You need to show the professor that you can think for yourself, that you know what you're talking about, and that you can write in an engaging style. If you are bored reading the paper, chances are your professor will be, too.  Add action verbs, remove passive ones, and use examples. Pretty soon you’ll be ready for a final draft.

Be sure to follow a timeline. Make sure that you start early to have enough time to go through many drafts.  If you wait until the day before, you will have time for only one draft!

== During the Drafting Process ==

Many writers often narrow -- or expand -- the topic as they write. Overly broad topics can be difficult to manage and can lead to summarization rather than descriptive explanation. Narrowing your topic will provide you with a more workable idea to focus on. Asking questions about what you want to know regarding your topic and what you want your readers to know will help focus your writing. If you choose to narrow your topic, first try to picture a larger context into which your thesis fits. Make a claim which forecasts the main point(s) of your thesis, then deliver the source which supports the argument. During this stage, scan for grammatically weak areas and unsupported claims. You may always add background information, term definitions, literature review, reasons for your assumptions, and counter-arguments to strengthen your own argument.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;My starting point [in writing] is always a feeling of partisanship, a sense of injustice . . . I write because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I wish to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing.&quot;|caption=--George Orwell}}

Sometimes you will find that it is easier to write the introduction after you have written the body of your paper. Consider waiting to write the introduction until you have a definite sense of what direction you want your paper to take. Many times, if you write an introduction first, it can limit the information or collaboration of ideas for the bulk of the paper. If you do decide to save the introduction for later, go over what you have written and identify the main point, or points, of your paper. Next, craft an introduction with a thesis statement that forecasts what will follow. Be aware that you need to rework some of the body after you do the introduction. No matter what you choose to write first, it is important to stay on track. Emphasize several points that are related to your thesis by adding more information and going deeper into detail. It is important to gather sufficient information to support your thesis. You may be required to provide a reference or in-text citation, or you may find that you do not yet know enough about your topic, and more research is required. Research may be necessary for multiple reasons: to learn more about the topic, to provide examples for your thesis, or to use as support for your thoughts, opinions, and the overall direction of your paper.

===Let It Flow=== 

As you draft, do not stop to edit or look up small pieces of information; there will be time for precision later. Luke Sullivan, author of &quot;Hey Whipple, Squeeze This,&quot; suggests that you must &quot;write hot and edit cold.&quot; In other words, write off the top of your head and allow your thoughts to be spontaneous. You never want to leave a good idea out. However, when it comes to polishing the final product, become critical by taking out unnecessary words or ideas that stray from the main message. Do not keep text that distracts or causes misunderstandings. If you have a question, place it in brackets or make a note of it and refer back to it later. First, just get your ideas out without worrying about punctuation or spelling. Similarly, if you notice a big gap which requires more research, skip it and work on other sections. The important thing is to let your ideas keep coming and make progress on the page. No matter how irrelevant your words may appear, keep writing. If you have to stop, be sure to end in a place where it will be easy to pick up from later. Don't get distracted when your initial drafts aren't &quot;A&quot; quality work. That's the reason they are drafts. The important thing is to get your ideas down on paper. You can spend time evaluating them later on. 

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;Write 1,000 words a day. That's only about four pages, but force yourself to do it. Put your finger down your throat and throw up. That's what writing's all about.&quot;|caption=--Ray Bradbury}}

===Dealing with Writer's Block=== 


Writer's block can occur at any point during the writing process. You may find yourself sitting down to write when you suddenly realize that you can't think of a single thing to say. Don't panic! It's a common problem with a variety of solutions.  [[File:Malware_logo.png|thumb|right|alt=A none ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]


Here are a few...

*Staring at a blank screen can be intimidating. Try writing out your dilemma in the form of a question: &quot;What is it I'm trying to say?&quot; &quot;What are my goals?&quot;  Then [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition/Planning_and_Prewriting#What_is_a_Brainstorm.3F brainstorm] to answer these questions.
*Take a break. Ten minutes away from your work will usually recharge your creativity.
*Review the literature on your topic to see what other people are saying. Even opposing views can be inspiring.
*Bounce ideas off someone else. Speaking about your writer's block with friends, family, and fellow students may help untangle ideas or generate new ones.

===Experiment=== 
How do you start your draft? While the occasional flash of inspiration can lead you to scribble out great work on the back of an envelope with a stubby pencil, paying brief attention not only to 'what you write', but 'how you write' can inspire you to write differently or even more effectively. If you start drafting from the conclusion, for example, it could be like having a &quot;Guiding Star&quot; for your paper. Or you could leave the introduction and conclusion blank until the end. With that said, you can make up your own approach to create your own way of writing. All the technological tools you have access to make it possible for you to write virtually anytime, anywhere, and however you want. Take advantage of it. Type on your computer, do research on it, record your own voice if the pen is slowing down your thinking. Many people find it helpful to brainstorm; start writing for an extended period of time without stopping, and see what you can come up with.  Charting can be a good way to come up with ideas and see connections you may not otherwise notice; when you chart, you write down a topic in the center of the paper.  Then write other words or ideas that fit in with the topic.  Draw lines that connect the related ideas.  Experiment with your approach to writing.

[[File:Zola_Leandre.jpg|thumb|alt=Zola Leandre Caricature.|]]
===Meeting the Minimum Word Count===

If you are having trouble meeting the minimum page length, look over your paper again and see if you can find spots that could use additional detail. Also, look at your assignment sheet again to see if you met the assignment's requirements. It is okay to add more detail to certain sections; for instance, is &quot;a blue car&quot; sufficient, or would &quot;a 2007 Vista Blue Ford Mustang&quot; work better? But be careful not to make your paper too wordy. Remember that quality is more important than quantity. Just adding needless words to add to the word count keeps you from actually developing your ideas and strengthening the content of the paper.

===Title of Your Essay===
Coming up with a good title for your essay might seem difficult, but there are several techniques that can help. Although some writers start with a good title and write a paper to fit it, others (and probably most) worry about coming up with a good title after they're finished with the draft. The advantage of waiting until the end to work on the title is that you know exactly what you've written.

Many academic writers prefer a two-part title structure separated by a colon. The &quot;catchy&quot; bit goes before the colon, whereas the latter part is a straightforward description of the paper. For example, &quot;Cutting out the Cut and Paste: Why Schools Should Use Plagiarism Detection Software.&quot;  

Here are some tips for coming up with good titles:
* Get inspiration from best-selling books or well-known essays, particularly those closely related to your topic (e.g., &quot;Men are from Mars, Women are from Snickers: Candy Bars and the Obesity Epidemic.&quot;) 
* Look through your paper and see if you can identify some &quot;key words&quot; or special phrases that might serve as part of a title (i.e., &quot;Edit this Page: How Wikis Enable Collaborative Writing&quot; or &quot;The Blue Screen of Death: How to Respond to Technical Difficulties During a Presentation.&quot;) 
* Consider poetic devices, such as repeating consonant sounds (e.g., &quot;The Cost of Caring&quot;).
* Get inspiration from famous quotations or song lyrics (e.g., &quot;I Shaved My Legs for This?: A Feminist Perspective on Country Music.&quot;) 

If you can't come up with a good title right away, shut down your word processor and think about other things for a while. If you just can't come up with anything clever, just remember that a clear and precise title is much better than none at all. A title like &quot;The Use of Skull Imagery in Hamlet&quot; may not sound profound, but at least the reader will know what the paper is about.

==Final Thoughts on Drafting==
Here's a quick summary of the key guidelines in drafting:
* Don't worry about your audience before you draft. Your audience may dictate the style and tone of your writing, but it is more important to get a good start before adding potential complications to the mix.
* You may need to narrow or expand your topic as you develop your paper.
* If you are stumped about how to start the introduction, it might be helpful to simply skip it and come back to it later. The bigger picture might become clearer as you approach completion. 
* While drafting, keep all of your research close at hand. This will prevent the need to stop writing to look something up, which could break your concentration.
* Writing in 30-minute stretches, or longer, will establish momentum, making your job as a writer much easier.
* If you come across a small detail that you are unsure about, simply write yourself a note and come back to it later.
* The first draft will not be perfect. Your priority should be getting your thoughts out on paper (or on-screen).  Leave the fine-tuning for later.
* If you must stop writing, be sure to end in a place where you have a good idea of what comes next. You will be able to pick it up again more easily.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=&quot;Substitute “damn” every time you’re inclined to write “very”; your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.&quot;|caption=--Mark Twain}}

[[File:Samuel L Clemens, 1909.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Samuel L Clemens, 1909.|Samuel L Clemens, 1909.]] 

Although many writers and even some instructors use the terms interchangeably, you may find it helpful to see editing and revising as two different activities. For our purposes, editing means going through a piece of writing and making comments and suggestions about how it could be better--or even whether it's appropriate at all. Revising, on the other hand, occurs when a writer attempts to make the changes suggested during the editing process.

For example, an editor might suggest that you tweak your introduction to make it better fit the rest of the paper. The actual process of changing the introduction is called revising and comes with own set of difficulties. We talk more about that process in the [[Rhetoric and Composition/Revising|Revising]] chapter.

You may be called upon to edit other students' writing. This process is often called Peer Reviewing and is given a [[Rhetoric and Composition/Reviewing|separate chapter]] in this book. If you're concerned about how to diplomatically edit someone's work without being offensive, be sure to read it carefully. 

You can (and should) also edit your own work. This simply means going back over what you've written and finding ways to improve it. Most writers frequently switch between drafting new sentences and paragraphs and editing ones they've already written. 

In this chapter, we go over some basic editing strategies and some specific things to look for during the editing process.

As previously mentioned, revision concerns large sections of text, while editing concerns individual sentences. Below is a list of potential errors to consider while editing.

* Fragments
* Run-on sentences 
* Dangling or misplaced modifiers
* Adjective and adverb use
* Verb usage and tense
* Subject/verb agreement
* Pronoun/antecedent agreement
* Sentence balance
* Comma Use
* Spelling
* Word choice (connotation vs. denotation) 
* Format/presentation

==Sentence Structure==

; Use active verbs. 
:: '''''Be-verbs'''''  (is, am, are, was, were, be, has/have been)  indicate condition and often require an extra sentence or clause to be sound. &lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt; Active verbs &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt; allow you to compose sharply without numbing the rhythm of your writing. Read your writing with an objective eye and think: “How can I make every sentence and paragraph straightforward and simple?” Below are examples in italics of wordy and confusing verbiage. Below the italics are the same sentences that have been simplified. 
:
::''''The sharp rise in fuel prices &lt;b&gt; is &lt;/b&gt; a serious challenge to trucking firms. It makes it hard for them to provide timely service to customers and to meet payroll expenses.''
::Sharply rising fuel prices '''''challenge''''' trucking firms by causing delays in customer service and payroll. 
::''Primary causes of the rise in fuel prices '''are''' an issue of confusion for many citizens. They don’t know how to fight the rise because they don’t know its cause.''
::Primary causes of rising fuel prices '''''elude''''' many citizens, making them unaware of how to fight the increase.'' 

; Name the people. Directly state &lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt; who or what group &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/i&gt; is acting in your sentences. Note the contrast in power and clarity among the sentences below:
  
:: '''Without people:''' ''A citywide ban on indoor smoking in Duluth originally caused a marked drop in bar patronage.''
:: '''With people:''' ''When the Duluth City Council passed a citywide ban on indoor smoking, many people stopped going to bars.''

; Eliminate wordy phrases. Certain stock phrases are weak and wordy. They can make you sound stuffy or as though you’re just trying to fill up space. Use these replacements: 
:: '''Because, Since, Why:''' ''the reason for, for the reason that, owing/due to the fact that, in light of the fact that, considering the fact that, on the grounds that, this is why''
:: '''When:''' ''on the occasion of, in a situation in which, under circumstances in which''
:: '''About, Regarding:''' ''as regards, in reference to, with regard to, concerning the matter of, where ABC is concerned''
:: '''Must, Should:''' ''it is crucial that, it is necessary that, there is a need/necessity for, it is important that, it cannot be avoided that''
:: '''Can:''' ''is able to, has the opportunity to, has the capacity for, has the ability to''
:: '''May, Might, Could:''' ''it is possible that, there is a chance that, it could happen that, the possibility exists for''

Luckily, Internet users can find numerous web sites about how to eliminate wordiness.


; Use Parallelism in sentences. Parallelism sounds difficult but is easy to write or edit.  Parallelism uses the same pattern in words and structure to show equal importance or provide balance in sentences
:: John likes reading, '''his studies,''' and talking.
Corrected: John likes reading, studying, and talking.
:: We were asked to calculate scores, record them, and '''putting them''' on the bulletin board.
Corrected: We were asked to calculate scores, record them, and post them on the bulletin board.
:: The science class had to dissect frogs or '''were experimenting''' with gases.
Corrected: The science class had to dissect frogs or experiment with gases.

To check for parallelism, first circle or highlight every '''and''' or '''or''' to check for balance in the sentence.  List the phrases from your sentence on a separate piece of paper. 
Example:
'''reading,'''
'''his studies,''' 
'''and talking.'''
Make corrections to your list to create balance:
'''reading,''' 
'''studying,''' 
'''and talking.'''

Once you fix a few sentences, problems with parallelism become easier to recognize and to correct!

==Editing Tips==
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=&quot;Bad spellers of the world, untie!&quot;|caption=--Graffito}}

[[File:ٍEditing strike01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A pair of glasses sitting on a computer keyboard.]] 

Editing is like going over your writing with a fine-toothed comb, scanning the surface and the depths for errors, misstatements, and a lack of clarity. 
First, '''keep resources close'''. Gather your writing handbook, dictionary, thesaurus, handouts, and any other editing resources and ''keep them close''. This way, you will not be tempted to guess at the correct way to do something. Instead, use your resources when you need them. Spelling errors can be avoided if you have a dictionary nearby. Don't rely on spell check.  It will only correct the spelling, not the proper usage of a word. For example, the word '''their''' means someone's possession of something. When used in a sentence, &quot;We sat in ''their'' chairs.&quot; On the other hand, '''there''' is used to express an area or place. When used in a sentence, &quot;We sat over ''there''.&quot;  Looking up these words in a dictionary will prevent unnecessary errors from occurring.

Secondly, '''know your errors'''. Keep a list of the errors you tend to make next to a corresponding list of corrections. No writer makes unique mistakes all the time; instead, our mistakes are habitual. Know what yours are by looking at your instructor’s comments on past papers or by working with a writing tutor. That way, you can enhance your editing strategies by watching specifically for these types of errors. If there are grammar rules you find yourself looking up more frequently than others, write them down for future reference. 

Thirdly, '''break it down'''. Edit one thing at a time. Instead of reading your paper through from start to finish once or twice and trying to catch everything, try searching for one thing at a time. For example, you might go through your paper once to tighten up wordiness. Then, read through a second time, while looking for one type of error which you frequently make, such as comma splices. Then, try reading a third time looking for words that may have been misspelled when you ran a spell check. Read a fourth time for another characteristic error, such as subject-verb agreement.

Next, '''reduce visual clutter'''. Use two pieces of blank paper to cover up everything but one sentence at a time. This forces you to pay closer attention to the words because they are the only thing you see. Normally, our eyes move all over a text as we are reading; this trick will prevent that tendency. Lastly, '''work backwards'''. Read from the end of your paper to the beginning, one sentence at a time. When we read in the conventional manner--top to bottom or left to right--we tend to read quickly and are constantly leaping ahead without really focusing on the words. We tend to see what isn't there, because we know what it is supposed to say.  Reading backwards forces us to slow down, thereby allowing us to catch more errors within individual sentences.


When reviewing your work, it is also important to ensure that the tense you choose remains consistent.  '''Tense''' refers to the relation of details in the past, present, and future.  For example, one writer may tell a story about going to the mall in the present tense by saying, &quot;I '''am''' walking around the mall and I '''see''' my third grade teacher.&quot;  Another writer may choose to relate this story in the past tense by saying, &quot;I '''was''' walking around the mall when  I '''saw''' my third grade teacher.&quot;  Although it is important to select the tense that best suits the particular context a writer is using, it is equally important to remain consistent with whatever tense is chosen.  Inconsistency within tense is extremely confusing for readers.  It is important to review your use of tense to ensure that your language is clear.  For example, if you were to say &quot;I was walking around the mall and I see my third grade teacher&quot; your audience would be very confused, wondering if you were seeing your teacher in the present or last week.  By keeping your tense consistent your reader will always know when you experienced what you're writing about.

==Perspectives on Style==
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=&quot;Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.&quot;|caption=--Gore Vidal, American writer}}

[[File:GoreVidal2008.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Gore Vidal in 2008 seated and holding a cane and pen.|Gore Vidal at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, April 27, 2008.]] 

Prescription and description litter these pages and others. Some writers tell you how to write: how your writing should look, sound, and feel. These writers prescribe rules (writer's handbooks are their Bibles). Should you follow them? Prescription can be limiting. In some instances, it may be profitable or necessary to follow a formula (when writing a legal document or a theme for your fifth grade teacher, for example). It is necessary to learn the rules, if only to break them. Rules are not static, however. They evolve. Rules are added, changed, omitted. Current fashion is the only certainty. 

Other writers describe how text is actually written. They analyze past and present text, highlighting similarities, differences, and respective efficiency. They define goals and purpose. It may be purposeful to apply rules, yet at other times it may not. But do not allow yourself to become limited by prescription. 

Examine your goal and determine the best approach to reach it. 

'''Why discuss style in a section on editing?''' As you write, you make choices. As you edit, you examine the effectiveness of those choices. Some choices are more effective than others and may reinforce your message. It all depends on your goal, your purpose, and your audience. Are you writing a birthday greeting or a dissertation? An instant message or a public address? Your choices determine your text's effectiveness; they help relate meaning. 

As you can imagine, there are as many perspectives on style as there are available topics for writing. The following is an attempt to present some of those perspectives.

=== Richard Lanham on Prose Styles ===
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=&quot;You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.&quot;|caption=--Vladimir Nabokov}}

 

A book written by Richard Lanham titled ''Analyzing Prose'' is a great tool for writers looking to pick up ideas for new styles. Through this work, one can can gain techniques covering the following styles:

* Opaque and Transparent 
* Noun and Verb
* Paratactic and Hypotactic
* Periodic and Running 

Learning how to properly incorporate these styles into your own writing can transform your work from everyday textbook style writing into colorful, creative, individualistic styles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Given the potential use of SimCity games in urban planning courses, this book will explain how various real-life planning concepts have been incorporated into the game. For game-players, this will add depth to the explanations of elements of the game. For educators and students, this will allow this book to function as a 'study-guide' for courses which use SimCity to introduce basic concepts of urban planning, design, as well as government, and fiscal management. So, for example, the section on [[SimCity/Building Transportation|Building Transportation]] will include a description of the importance of transport planning in real-life urban planning, as well as its incorporation into SimCity.

| '''Note for SimCity4 users'''

'''''Many''''' tactics used in older SimCity games (SC2K, SC3K) do '''''not''''' apply to SC4. Although most of the basic concepts are still there, many parts of the game are completely different. See &quot;[[../SimCity 4/Concepts|SimCity 4 Concepts]]&quot; for more info.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Obviously, by the game name, you should have guessed this has something to building cities. There are many, many different things to do.

Gameplay is controlled by the mouse, and the graphics are pre-rendered on an isometric grid that can be zoomed in and out.

===Introduction to real-life Urban Planning ===
Urban, city, or town planning, deals with design of the built environment from the municipal and metropolitan perspective. Other professions deal in more detail with a smaller scale of development, namely architecture, landscape architecture and urban design. Regional planning deals with a still larger environment, at a less detailed level. The Greek Hippodamus is often considered the father of city planning, for his design of Miletus, though examples of planned cities permeate antiquity. Muslims are thought to have originated the idea of formal zoning (see haram and hima and the more general notion of khalifa, or &quot;stewardship&quot; from which they arise), although modern usage in the West largely dates from the ideas of the Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne. 

The Indus Valley civilization is recognized as having been the first to develop urban planning. By 2600 BC some pre-Harappan settlements grew into cities containing thousands of people who were not primarily engaged in agriculture, creating a unified culture whose sudden appearance appears to have been the result of planned, deliberate effort. Some settlements appear to have been deliberately rearranged to conform to a conscious, well-developed plan. For this reason, the Indus Valley civilization is recognized as having first developed urban planning.

In ancient times, Romans used a consolidated scheme for city planning, developed for military defense and civil convenience. Effectively, many European towns still preserve the essence of these schemes, as in Turin. The basic plan is a central plaza with city services, surrounded by a compact grid of streets and wrapped in a wall for defense. To reduce travel times, two diagonal streets cross the square grid corner-to-corner, passing through the central square. A river usually flows through the city, to provide water and transport, and carry away sewage, even in sieges.

Modern city planning embraces the organization, or conscious influencing, of land-use distribution in an area already built-up or intended to become built-up. Many of the concepts of real-life Urban and City planning have been incorporated into the SimCity games.

===Introduction to American Municipal Government===
In the United States, municipalities such as cities, towns, or villages are the level of local government below that of the county (although many states also have civil townships which are a separate type of government below the county level but distinct from municipalities). Most U.S. municipalities are governed in one of two ways, Council-Manager government and Mayor-Council government. A third form, the City Commission government, was once common but has fallen out of favor.

A partial list of some of the more common rights and responsibilities of a municipality include:
* The ability to require payment of taxes by entities (people and corporations) who own, use, occupy, or legally interact with other entities that own, use, or are legally located within the municipality's geographic boundaries;
* The ability to create debt on behalf of the citizens, who are responsible for repayment of those debts;
* The responsibility to enforce various federal, state, and municipal laws with a police force;
* The responsibility to provide for civil defence and other special needs.

Municipal governments are usually divided into several administrative departments, depending on the size of the municipality. Though municipalities differ in the division of responsibility, the typical arrangement is to have the following departments handle the following roles:

* Urban planning and zoning:
* Public works: construction and maintenance of all municipality-owned or operated assets, including the water supply system, sewer, streets, snow removal, street signs, vehicles, buildings, land, etc.
* Parks and recreation department: (construction and maintenance of) public parks, common areas, parkways, publicly owned lands and so on. Also, operation of various recreation programs and facilities. This department often operates as a regional entity with its own tax authority and governmental structure.
* Police
* Fire department
* Accounting / Finance: collects taxes owed by the municipality, incorporates human resources department for municipal workers,
* Legal: handles all legal matters including writing municipal bonds, verifying the municipality is in compliance with state and federal laws and mandates, and responding to citizen lawsuits where the municipality is a named party. Being named in a lawsuit may mean the municipality is a defendant, plaintiff, jointly with another entity or just by itself. Typical legal actions include: someone falling on publicly-owned sidewalks suing the municipality for negligence in failing to make the sidewalk safe to walk on; a municipality annexing land; etc.
* Transport (varies widely): If the municipality has a public bus or light rail service, this function may be handled by its own department or it may be folded into another of the above departments or a special-purpose authority may be established to administer services applicable to multiple municipalities.

=== SimCity Concepts and Objectives ===
Many of the concepts used in modern urban planning, as well as municipal government, have been carried into SimCity. The objective of SimCity, as the name of the game suggests, is to build and design a city, without specific goals to achieve (except in the scenarios, which typically require the player to achieve a certain population or bank balance in a given period of time). The player can mark land as being zoned as commercial, industrial, or residential, add buildings, change the tax rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and many other actions, in order to enhance the city. Also, the player can face disasters: flooding, tornadoes, fires, riots, earthquakes, etc. Later disasters included lightning strikes, volcanoes, meteors and attack by extra-terrestrial craft. In the Nintendo and later versions one can also build rewards when they are given to them, like the mayor's mansion and the casino for gambling Sims.

=== Basic SimCity concepts ===

In SimCity, there are a number of real life City Planning and Municipal government concepts to learn:

# Population: How many Sims are in a city
# Simoleans: Your money. You spend this whenever you do something.
# Taxes: Simoleans taken from your Sims on a yearly basis to replenish your City's Simoleans
# Ordinances: Various laws that can be enacted/repealed at anytime. Some give you money (&quot;Legalized Gambling&quot; allows gambling, however, all casinos have to pay you), others take money. They also have different effects on your population, and will make some happy and others mad.
# Tile: The basic unit of measure in SimCity. Also refers to the isometric &quot;squares&quot; in the game.
# Zone: This is where Sims will build. The three main types are Residential, Commercial, and Industrial. Each Zone has different effects: placing Dense Industrial next to a Light Residential will probably get some Sims angry about the intense dust.
# Transportation: A tile that allows Sims to get from one place to another. They are obviously connected to each other. People will only build a certain amount of Tiles from a transportation tile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the most important aspects of urban planning, both in real life and in SimCity, is transportation.

=== The importance of Transport in Real-life Urban Planning ===
In urban planning, there is a direct, well-researched connection between the density of an urban environment, and the amount of transport into that environment. Good quality transport is often followed by development. Development beyond a certain density can quickly overcrowd transport.

Good planning attempts to place higher densities of jobs or residents near high-volume transport. For example, some cities permit commerce and multi-storey apartment buildings only within one block of train stations and four-lane boulevards, and accept single-family dwellings and parks further away.

Densities are usually measured as the floor area of buildings divided by the land area, or in a residential context, by the number of dwellings divided by the land area. Floor area ratios below 1.5 are low density. Plot ratios above five are very high density. Most exurbs are below two, while most city centers are well above five. Walk-up apartments with basement garages can easily achieve a density of three. Skyscrapers easily achieve densities of thirty or more. Higher densities tempt developers with higher profits. City authorities may try to encourage lower densities to reduce infrastructure costs, though some observers note that low densities may not accommodate enough population to provide adequate demand or funding for that infrastructure.

Automobiles are well suited to serve densities as high as 1.5 with basic limited-access highways. Innovations such as car-pool lanes and rush hour-use taxes may get automobiles to neighbourhoods with plot ratios as high as 2.5.

Densities above 5 are well-served by trains. Most such areas were actually developed in response to trains in the middle 1800s, and have historically high ridership that have never used automobiles for their work trip.

A widespread problem is that there is a range of residential densities between about two and five that causes severe traffic jams of automobiles, yet are too low to be commercially served by trains or light rail. The conventional solution is to use buses, but these and light rail systems may fail where automobiles and excess road network capacity are both available, achieving less than 1% ridership. Some theoreticians speculate that personal rapid transit might coax people from their automobiles, and yet effectively serve intermediate densities, but this has not been demonstrated. The Lewis-Mogridge Position claims that increasing road space is not an effective way of relieving traffic jams as latent or induced demand invariably emerges to restore a socially-tolerable level of congestion.

===Transport in SimCity===
These concepts of urban planning in real cities have been carried into the SimCity games. Roads, trains, subways, highways, bus systems, are all major forms of transportation, and are how your Sims will be able to get around your city. Like a real life mayor, or an urban planner, SimCity requires you to make a choice about which modes of transport are appropriate for your city. Similarly, there are consequences for your choices (for example, chosing roads in a high-density city, as with real life, will lead to traffic congestion and pollution).

In SC3K, look for the button with a picture of a road on it. That is the Transportation Menu. Click on it. Next to it, there will be some more buttons. Depending on which year you are in, you should be able to at least have Roads, Rail, and Rail Station. More options unlock as the years pass.

{|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot; style=&quot;background: #eee; border:1px solid #000; text-align: center&quot;
| '''Note for SC2K users'''

In SC2K, Road-based options (highways, tunnels) and Rail-based options (rail stations, subways) are in different menus. Not only that, but you have to hold them down to select an item.
|}

In SimCity 4, an expansion called SimCity 4 Rush Hour was released giving players additional transportation features other than the original options. On top of SimCity 4's street, road, elevated highways, subways, railways, seaports and airports, the expansion pack included new options. These were elevated railways (which could interlink with the subway network), monorail tracks, ferrys (which could serve as an alternative to a bridge saving money) ground-based highways (which were cheaper than elevated ones if used appropriately) and avenues (a two lane dual-carriageway which interlinks smoothly with roads, streets and highways). The expansion pack also came with an option to view the region map in a different way; it marked all the diffrent transportation links clearly.

*Add missing information '''Relational''' operators.
|C++ Programming}}

=== Logical operators ===
The operators &lt;tt&gt;'''and'''&lt;/tt&gt; (can also be written as '''&amp;&amp;''') and &lt;tt&gt;'''or'''&lt;/tt&gt; (can also be written as '''||''') allow two or more conditions to be chained together. The &lt;tt&gt;'''and'''&lt;/tt&gt; operator checks whether all conditions are true and the &lt;tt&gt;'''or'''&lt;/tt&gt; operator checks whether at least one of the conditions is true. Both operators can also be mixed together in which case the order in which they appear from left to right, determines how the checks are performed.  Older versions of the C++ standard used the keywords '''&amp;&amp;''' and '''||''' in place of &lt;tt&gt;'''and'''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;'''or'''&lt;/tt&gt;. Both operators are said to ''short circuit''. If a previous &lt;tt&gt;'''and'''&lt;/tt&gt; condition is false, later conditions are not checked. If a previous &lt;tt&gt;'''or'''&lt;/tt&gt; condition is true later conditions are not checked.

{{NOTE|The iso646.h header file is part of the C standard library, since 1995, as an amendment to the C90 standard. It defines a number of macros which allow programmers to use C language bitwise and logical operators in textual form, which, without the header file, cannot be quickly or easily typed on some international and non-QWERTY keyboards.
These symbols are keywords in the ISO C++ programming language and do not require the inclusion of a header file. For consistency, however, the C++98 standard provides the header &lt;ciso646&gt;. On MS Visual Studio that historically implements nonstandard language extensions this is the only way to enable these keywords (via macros) without disabling the extensions.}} 

The &lt;tt&gt;'''not'''&lt;/tt&gt; (can also be written as '''!''') operator is used to return the inverse of one or more conditions.

* '''Syntax''':
 ''condition1 ''&lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt;'' condition2''
 ''condition1 ''&lt;b&gt;or&lt;/b&gt;'' condition2''
 &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; ''condition''
 
* '''Examples''':


When something should not be true. It is often combined with other conditions. If x&gt;5 but not x = 10, it would be written:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if ((x &gt; 5) and not (x == 10)) // if (x greater than 5) and ( not (x equal to 10) ) 
{
  //...code...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

When all conditions must be true. If x must be between 10 and 20:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (x &gt; 10 and x &lt; 20) // if x greater than 10 and x less than 20
{
  //....code...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

When at least one of the conditions must be true. If x must be equal to 5 or equal to 10 or less than 2:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (x == 5 or x == 10 or x &lt; 2) // if x equal to 5 or x equal to 10 or x less than 2
{
  //...code...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

When at least one of a group of conditions must be true. If x must be between 10 and 20 or between 30 and 40.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if ((x &gt;= 10 and x &lt;= 20) or (x &gt;= 30 and x &lt;= 40)) // &gt;= -&gt; greater or equal etc...
{
  //...code...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Things get a bit more tricky with more conditions. The trick is to make sure the parenthesis are in the right places to establish the order of thinking intended. However, when things get this complex, it can often be easier to split up the logic into nested if statements, or put them into bool variables, but it is still useful to be able to do things in complex boolean logic.

Parenthesis around &lt;tt&gt;x &gt; 10&lt;/tt&gt; and around &lt;tt&gt;x &lt; 20&lt;/tt&gt; are implied, as the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; operator has a higher precedence than &lt;tt&gt;'''and'''&lt;/tt&gt;. First &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is compared to 10. If &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is greater than 10, &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is compared to 20, and if &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is also less than 20, the code is executed.


==== and (&amp;&amp;) ====
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
|+
! style=&quot;width:35px;background:#aaaaaa;&quot; | ''statement1''

|-
| T  || T  || T
|-
| T  || F  || F
|-
| F  || T  || F
|-
| F  || F  || F
|}

The logical AND operator, '''and''', compares the left value and the right value. If both ''statement1'' and ''statement2'' are true, then the expression returns TRUE. Otherwise, it returns FALSE.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if ((var1 &gt; var2) and (var2 &gt; var3))
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; var1 &quot; is bigger than &quot; &lt;&lt; var2 &lt;&lt; &quot; and &quot; &lt;&lt; var3 &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In this snippet, the '''if''' statement checks to see if ''var1'' is greater than ''var2''. Then, it checks if ''var2'' is greater than ''var3''. If it is, it proceeds by telling us that ''var1'' is bigger than both ''var2'' and ''var3''.

{{NOTE|note=The logical AND operator '''and''' is sometimes written as '''&amp;&amp;''', which is not the same as the address operator and the bitwise AND operator, both of which are represented with '''&amp;'''}}

==== or (||)====
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
|+
! style=&quot;width:35px;background:#aaaaaa;&quot; | ''statement1''

! style=&quot;width:35px&quot; | or
|-
| T  || T  || T
|-
| T  || F  || T
|-
| F  || T  || T
|-
| F  || F  || F
|}

The logical OR operator is represented with '''or'''. Like the logical AND operator, it compares ''statement1'' and ''statement2''. If either ''statement1'' or ''statement2'' are true, then the expression is true. The expression is also true if both of the statements are true.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if ((var1 &gt; var2) or (var1 &gt; var3))
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; var1 &quot; is either bigger than &quot; &lt;&lt; var2 &lt;&lt; &quot; or &quot; &lt;&lt; var3 &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Let's take a look at the previous expression with an OR operator. If ''var1'' is bigger than either ''var2'' or ''var3'' or both of them, the statements in the '''if''' expression are executed. Otherwise, the program proceeds with the rest of the code.

==== not (!)  ====
The logical NOT operator, '''not''', returns TRUE if the statement being compared is not true. Be careful when you're using the NOT operator, as well as any logical operator. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
not x &gt; 10
&lt;/source&gt;

The logical expressions have a higher precedence than normal operators. Therefore, it compares whether &quot;not x&quot; is greater than 10. However, this statement always returns false, no matter what &quot;x&quot; is. That's because the logical expressions only return boolean values(1 and 0).

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are four major versions of SimCity, all created by Maxis. 

The versions are: 
* SimCity
* SimCity 2000
* SimCity 3000
* SimCity 4

They are abbreviated as follows: 
* SC for the original game
* SC2K for SimCity 2000
* SC3K for SimCity 3000
* SC4 for SimCity 4.

===Game-related Terms===
* Ordinances: Various laws that can be enacted/repealed at anytime. Some give you money (&quot;Legalized Gambling&quot; allows gambling, however, all casinos have to pay you), others take money. They also have different effects on your population, and will make some happy and others mad.
* Population: How many Sims are in a city
* Simoleans: Your money. You spend this whenever you do something.
* Taxes: Simoleans taken from your Sims on a yearly basis to replenish your City's Simoleans
* Transportation: A tile that allows Sims to get from one place to another. They are obviously connected to each other. People will only build a certain amount of Tiles from a transportation tile.
* Tile: The basic unit of measure in SimCity. Also refers to the isometric &quot;squares&quot; in the game.
* Zone: This is where Sims will build. The three main types are Residential, Commercial, and Industrial. Each Zone has different effects: placing Dense Industrial next to a Light Residential will probably get some Sims angry about the intense dust.

      <text xml:space="preserve">H. Lasswell's definition of communication is &quot;who says what to whom by what means and to what effect.&quot; 

The three functions of media are to entertain, inform, and persuade.

There are four types of communication: intra-personal (daydreams and internal monologues), interpersonal (discussion in small groups), group (discussion with large groups, such as public speaking), and mass (technology-driven communication with thousands or millions of people). The system of communication which brings news and entertainment to the populace at large through books, newspapers, radio, television, and the Internet is called the &quot;Mass Media.&quot; 

The Mass Media is playing an increasingly large role in our everyday lives. The term mass media is mainly used by academics and media-professionals. When members of the general public refer to &quot;the media&quot; they are usually referring to the mass media, or to the news media, which is a section of the mass media. 

Mass media is a term used to denote, as a class, that section of the media specifically conceived and designed to reach a very large audience (typically at least as large as the whole population of a nation state). It was coined in the 1920s with the advent of nationwide radio networks and of mass-circulation newspapers and magazines. The mass-media audience has been viewed by some commentators as forming a mass society with special characteristics, notably atomization or lack of social connections, which render it especially susceptible to the influence of modern mass media techniques such as advertising and propaganda.

The mass media system has controls: media monitors whom ensure that bad messages are cut down or eliminated. These include regulators (such as the FCC), pressure groups (such as the Catholics, whose power is leveraged through boycotts), and gatekeepers, such as editors, directors, and corporate moguls like Rupert Murdoch. A classic example of a gatekeeper exercising control was when NBC fired Phil Donohue over ideological differences.

Another control is perceived public opinion. For example, the press doesn't like to run photos of the dead or injured from war, for fear of public outrage.

=Introduction=

Stills photography involves taking photos of the filmmaking process.  These are often used for promoting the film and as a documentary record. This area of film production is often overlooked on smaller budget films or some photographs are taken by members of the crew, but for promotional and documentary uses; good quality and professional images are a must. If the film budget can't stretch to a professional photographer, many photographers will do work to use in their portfolios, and for the experience.

[[image:production_still.jpg|thumb|500px|An example of a production still taken on the set of a music video]]

'''Alternative names'''
* Production stills
* Unit stills

=Equipment=
Both film and digital have their respective advantages and disadvantages. Digital photography provides instant results, and combining this with a notebook computer means the results can be viewed instantly by the photographer, crew and cast. The choice often comes down to personal preference, but is sometimes dictated by the stills photographer's brief. Medium and large format cameras are often used for a higher quality image although 35mm is usually sufficient, and is often used for speed and ease of use. Large format cameras - considered superior in terms of image quality - is a slower medium, and often hard to use on a busy set. Generally the equipment will suit the type of shots required. If the shots are &quot;reportage&quot; style, then 35mm is advantageous. High-quality cast / set shots can be taken on medium/large especially for very large poster/billboard reproductions.

=Publishing stills photos online=

If you have your own webspace then it's very easy to install a free gallery package and publish your photos online.  Some excellent free gallery packages include:

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This brief summary is an illustration of an attempt to model a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial (bps) understanding of self-consciousness seen from the perspective of both scientific methodology and metaphysical logic where the empirical and the inferential provide a seamless blend of the ontological brain with the epistemological mind.  

The achievement of self consciousness is the crucial mental state allowing the human species to monitor the equilibrium state of biopsychosocial ongoing contingencies especially when confronting life-threatening circumstances. The inherited proto-semantics and acquired language guide the required recursive co-generation of the appropriate language and thought to meet the contingency. Thus informed, it allows humans to elaborate effective adaptive short and long range responses. 

===Definition of terms===

Bps model uses some unusual definitions of terms. These are explained below.  

&quot;Sense-phenomenal awareness&quot; is defined as an unconscious, life-preserving, adaptive reflex response which may occur without qualia. It originates at a sensory receptor, wherever located in the body economy, and ends at an effector organ, glandular or muscular. 
- Phenomenal consciousness/awareness is a term normally reserved for experience containing qualia in other analyses. 

System/network &quot;awareness&quot; is defined in the bps model as that unconscious processing occurring during the integration of the participating neural network modules leading to a stereotyped adaptive response.
- normally awareness is defined as knowledge that a conscious state is present. 

Sense-phenomenal awareness may become a conscious experience when relevant inferential networks (e.g., memory, emotions, etc.)are subsequently accessed, including inner-language processors.  When experiences are recalled the qualia that arise are called &quot;conceptual qualia&quot;. 

&quot;Access consciousness&quot; is described as being initially an unconscious process that makes it possible for a life-preserving, reflex-driven and 'unconscious' sense-phenomenal state of mind to become conscious by making use of available, pertinent and concurrent mental states to interact with the novel sense-phenomenal input, a potentially life-threatening event.

&quot;Proto-linguistic organ&quot; or 'plo' is described as the first line of defense to guard against life-threatening stimuli arising from sense-phenomenal inputs (external, visceral or proprioceptive). Housed in the amygdaloidal complex, it represents the inherited proto-semantic (primitive 'meanings') database responsible for activating the corresponding unconscious fight/flight adaptive Cannon effector response. 

&quot;Proto-semantic&quot; input from plo is described as a required initial participant in the subsequent recursive co-generation of inner language and thought as may be required in the eventual elaboration of &quot;conceptual consciousness&quot;.

===Higher order consciousness theory===

The 'bps' model of 'consciousness' is a high order consciousness theory in which an unconscious, non inferential phenomenal state (established from either online sensory receptor input or offline memory input), when confronting a novel life-threatening event, triggers an initially unconscious access intermediate stage where relevant modular networks are incorporated including Broca's language processor recursively co-generating in the process the 'inner language' narrative state and accompanying thought, a conscious high order mental state, all of which causally precedes (or is simultaneous with) the adaptive response (if any, as we see in dreams). 

Notice that bps considers phenomenal states to be non-conscious, this would confuse the ordinary reader who expects the Kantian term &quot;phenomenal&quot; to be equivalent to the term &quot;conscious experience&quot;. Only the higher order mental state is regarded as &quot;conscious&quot;.

The 'bps' model basically describes two co-existing, ongoing mental states, one non-inferential subconscious 'gut feeling' inner sense (BOP, a variant of Lycan's 1996 HOP) and an initially non-inferential unconscious accessing of narrative pathways leading to (recursive co-generation of 'inner language' and thought is an open option) the eventual production of higher order thought (HOT) whose content is the feeling that oneself is the subject of self-consciousness. 

In other words, according to the 'bps' theory, feelings are not part of consciousness until higher order thought occurs, i.e., qualia needs a context.

In 'bps' theory not even self-consciousness, of which 'qualia' may arguably be considered a subset of, has revealed its constitutive secrets. This means that bps is a theory of brain processing rather than a theory of the content of consciousness (qualia) or consciousness itself except when it ventures into the postulate that language and self-consciousness are recursively co-generated or co-causal. More controversial is the mediation of the amygdaloid complex (plo) in providing inherited primitive 'meanings' (protosemantic codelets) to initiate Chomskian language processing and thought co-generation, i.e., protosemantics precedes syntax structuring.

[[Image:IF-THEN-ELSE-END_flowchart.svg|frame|Using IF...THEN.]]
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 IF &lt;test&gt; THEN &lt;clauses&gt;:
 ELSE &lt;clauses&gt;:END:
Or for &quot;nesting&quot; IF  statements:
 IF &lt;test&gt; THEN &lt;clauses&gt;:
 ELSE IF &lt;test&gt; THEN &lt;clauses&gt;:
 ELSE &lt;clauses&gt;:END:
 ELSE &lt;clauses&gt;:END:
Or for running IF such that no action is performed should the test be false:
 IF &lt;test&gt; THEN &lt;clauses&gt;:
 ELSE END:

'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* IF statements are a set of commands used to test certain equations or inequations. If the result is &quot;true&quot;, then a set of actions are performed. If not, no action is performed, or a different set of actions are performed as per ELSE.
* Tests can be combined with AND or OR.

'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 PROMPT A:
 IF A==0 THEN
 MSGBOX &quot;You entered zero.&quot;:
 ELSE MSGBOX &quot;You didn't enter zero.&quot;:END:
This is a basic example, only checking for one result. Here's a more complex one, although multiple IF...THEN statements are usually best replaced with CASE.
 PROMPT A:
 IF A==0 THEN
 MSGBOX &quot;You entered zero.&quot;:
 ELSE IF A&gt;0 THEN
 MSGBOX &quot;You entered a positive number.&quot;:
 ELSE END:ELSE IF A&lt;0 THEN
 MSGBOX &quot;You entered a negative number.&quot;
 ELSE END:ELSE END:
Note that the additional &quot;ELSE IF&quot; commands displayed are not actually commands per se. What is actually happening is that the result of the previous test, when evaluated as &quot;false&quot;, moves on to the ELSE result, where it encounters IF, telling it to start ''another'' IF statement. This is what the &quot;ELSE END&quot; commands do - they close off the secondary statements nested within the original statement.

[[Image:IF-THEN-ELSE-END_flowchart.svg|frame|Using IF...THEN.]]
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 CASE IF &lt;test&gt; THEN &lt;clauses&gt;: END ... END:

'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
CASE is the command that is used in the place of multiple statements.

The best way of describing this is with a flowchart, seen right. Compare to the lower IF flowchart, and you can see how the CASE command is more efficient when there is more than one option.

'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
CASE is especially useful when accepting input from a CHOOSE list. For example:
 1?A:CHOOSE A;
 &quot;FAVOURITE APPLE?&quot;;
 &quot;Granny Smith&quot;;
 &quot;Golden Delicious&quot;;
 &quot;Pink Lady&quot;:
 CASE
 
 IF A==1 THEN
 MSGBOX &quot;Granny Smiths are my favourite, too!&quot;:
 END
 
 IF A==2 THEN
 MSGBOX &quot;Golden Delicious apples are OK, too.&quot;:
 END 
 
 IF A==3 THEN
 MSGBOX &quot;Bleh, I can't stand Pink Ladies!&quot;:
 END
 
 END:
 MSGBOX &quot;Program finished.&quot;:

The first five lines initiate the CHOOSE menu. Of particular note is the 1?A at the start, this sets the default value of the menu to 1 (ie. the first option) and thus ensures that the menu operates correctly (if the value of A begins as outside the acceptable value for the menu, the highlighting will not operate correctly).

CASE initiates the CASE statement. You can then see three branches of this statement; one for each of the three menu options specified in CHOOSE. The basic syntax is:
 CASE IF &lt;clause 1&gt; THEN &lt;action set 1&gt; END IF &lt;clause 2&gt; THEN &lt;action set 2&gt; END ... END:
Importantly (and counter-intuitively), the END at the end of an IF/THEN/END statement within CASE does '''not''' contain a full-colon at the end of it! However, the final END completing the CASE does require one.

You should be familiar with the MSGBOXs in each action set, these are a simple way of displaying text in a dialog and FREEZEing at the same time. The final MSGBOX is included to demonstrate what happens once the command completes; it skips to the final END:, so if you had somehow tricked the program into giving a non-valid answer (ie. changing the input for A) the program would just display the final MSGBOX. The same happens after the appropriate clause has been run for A==?.

==IFERR==

==RUN==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 RUN &quot;&lt;program-name&gt;&quot;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Ceases running the current program, and runs &lt;program-name&gt; instead.
* You can self-reference using this command, creating an infinite loop.
'''Dangers'''&lt;br&gt;
* The program name you reference is case-sensitive; that is, &quot;ProGramNaME&quot; is not the same as &quot;programname&quot;.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
This program is called &quot;INFINITE&quot;.
 MSGBOX &quot;You can't escape!&quot;:
 RUN &quot;INFINITE&quot;:
It should be noted that you can &quot;escape&quot;, just press ON - this usually cancels the current command from running and this feature is designed specifically to allow users to cancel programs stuck in an infinite loop due to a programming error or malicious intent by the software author.

==STOP==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 STOP:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Exits the program immediately. Compare it to BREAK.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
This program is called &quot;EXAMPLE&quot;.
 MSGBOX &quot;Want to exit? 1 = yes, 0 = no.&quot;:
 PROMPT A:
 IF A==1 THEN STOP:
 ELSE RUN &quot;EXAMPLE&quot;:
This command is practically self-explanatory.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Important note==
The drawing commands are somewhat confusing in that they reference parts of the 'plot', not parts of the physical screen.

It is intuitive to assume that (knowing that the screen is 131x64 pixels wide, and that the calculator references points by a Cartesian-like system) a pixel at (1,1) will '''always''' be the most bottom-right pixel on the screen.

However, this is not the case. (1,1) is the pixel at (1,1) on the infinite 'plot'. This means that it will '''only''' be the bottom-right pixel, as expected, when the plot is set to the dimensions 1?X?131 and 1?Y?64. This can be done by setting the (X/Y)(MIN/MAX) commands to appropriate values:
 1?XMIN:131?XMAX:
 1?YMIN:64?YMAX:
Adding this code to the start of your program will set the calculator's plot size to these specifications automatically, ensuring smooth operation of your program. However, upon the program's completion, any graph the user might have set up will be displayed on a (presumably) incorrect plotsize, which may frustrate the user. You could work around this like follows:
 XMIN?A:XMAX?B:
 YMIN?C:YMAX?D:
 1?XMIN:131?XMAX:
 1?YMIN:64?YMAX:
 
 &lt;program code goes here&gt;
 
 A?XMIN:B?XMAX:
 C?YMIN:D?YMAX
Of course, this adds bloat to the program somewhat, but will resolve the problem '''as long as''' you don't use the variables you selected in the program for other purposes. An alternate method would be to store the values in a list.

==ARC==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 ARC &lt;cent-x&gt;;&lt;cent-y&gt;;&lt;radius&gt;;&lt;start&gt;;&lt;end&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* &lt;cent-x&gt; and &lt;cent-y&gt; are the x- and y-coordinates of the center of the arc.
* &lt;radius&gt; is simply the radius of the arc.
* &lt;start&gt; is the starting angle of the arc, and &lt;end&gt; the finishing angle.
** Angles are measured mathematically, that is, the same as the [[w:unit circle|unit circle]]; with 0° being the equivalent of due east on the compass, not due north, and counter-clockwise being the positive direction.
'''Dangers'''&lt;br&gt;
* The ARC command utilises the current angle mode for arguments &lt;start&gt; and &lt;end&gt;. Therefore, if you design your arcs using degrees, it may be wise to set the angle mode to degrees programmatically like so:
 1?HAngle:
* Alternately, an HAngle value of 2 or 3 can be used to set the calculator in radians or grads, respectively.
* The ARC command is particularly slow, so if you need to draw extensively, it may be wise (although time-consuming) to use MAKEGROB.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 ARC 65;32;15;0;360:
Draws a full circle of radius 15px, from the center of the screen.

 ARC 65;32;15;10;80:
 ARC 65;32;15;100;170:
 ARC 65;32;15;190;260:
 ARC 65;32;15;280;350:
Draws a full circle comprised of four arcs, but the circle is missing a arc of 20° at each cardinal point.
Represented more concisely using a loop:
 FOR X=0 TO 270 STEP 90;
 ARC 65;32;15;10+X;80+X:
 END:

==BOX==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 BOX &lt;x1&gt;;&lt;y1&gt;;&lt;x2&gt;;&lt;y2&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* (&lt;x1&gt;,&lt;y1&gt;) are the coordinates of the box's starting corner.
* (&lt;x2&gt;,&lt;y2&gt;) are the coordinates of the corner that completes the box.
* There are no limitations on the corners used, as long as they are binary opposites, that is top-left and bottom-right or bottom-left and top-right. Additionally, the order they are used in is not significant.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 BOX 1;1;131;64:
Draws a box around the border of the screen.

 BOX 1;1;131;64:
 BOX 2;2;130;63:
Draws a border 2 pixels thick around the screen. More concisely:
 FOR X=0 TO 1;
 BOX 1+X;1+X;131-X;64-X:
 END:
This allows you to easily adjust the thickness of your border by simply adjusting the FOR command; for &quot;FOR X= TO Z&quot; the border will always be (Z-1) pixels thick.

==ERASE==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 ERASE:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Erases the contents of the screen, as simple as that.
* Adding ERASE: before any of the drawing commands is usually a good idea to prevent the program from drawing over the programs catalog, or any other view that the user happens to be in at the time.

==FREEZE==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 FREEZE:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Stops the program, and waits for a keypress to continue.
* Use it after you finish your drawing commands, so that the user has time to look at the screen!

==LINE==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 LINE &lt;x-start&gt;;&lt;y-start&gt;;&lt;x-end&gt;;&lt;y-end&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Draws a line from point (&lt;x-start&gt;,&lt;y-start&gt;) to point (&lt;x-end&gt;,&lt;y-end&gt;).
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 LINE 1;1;131;64:
 LINE 1;64;131;1:
Draws a cross across the screen.

==PIXON/PIXOFF==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 PIXON &lt;x&gt;;&lt;y&gt;:
 PIXOFF &lt;x&gt;;&lt;y&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Turns the pixel at (&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;) on or off.
'''Dangers'''&lt;br&gt;
* PIXON and PIXOFF are reasonably fast, but when inside a FOR loop (see below), can be appreciably slow. If you want to do something like a 'pretend' loading bar (or even a real one if it's applicable), you should use LINE or TLINE as they are faster.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 FOR X=1 TO 131 STEP 1;
 FOR Y=64 TO 1 STEP -1;
 PIXON X;Y:
 END:END:
 FOR X=131 TO 1 STEP -1;
 FOR Y=1 TO 64 STEP 1;
 PIXOFF X;Y:
 END:END:
Fills the screen with pixels from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, then reverses the process.

==TLINE==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 TLINE &lt;x-start&gt;;&lt;y-start&gt;;&lt;x-end&gt;;&lt;y-end&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Same as LINE, except the command performs a slightly different task - instead of turning a line of pixels on, it toggles them. That is to say, if all the pixels you're drawing across are off already (say you just used ERASE:), it will function as a regular LINE, but if there are already pixels turned on, it will turn those off, and conversely turn off pixels on.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 ERASE:
 DISPLAY? G1:
 GROBNOT G1:
 ?DISPLAY G1:
 TLINE 1;1;131;64:
 TLINE 1;64;131;1:
Draws a cross in white across the screen, after turning on all the pixels. Therefore, it acts the same as:
 ERASE:
 LINE 1;1;131;64:
 LINE 1;64;131;1:
 DISPLAY? G1:
 GROBNOT G1:
 ?DISPLAY G1:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==DISPLAY→==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 DISPLAY→ &lt;name&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Stores the display in GROB &lt;name&gt;. (Note that the arrow is going '''out of''' DISPLAY.)
* Usually used to generate GROBs on which to perform additional graphic commands.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 DISPLAY→ G1:
 ERASE:WAIT 2:
 →DISPLAY G1:
 FREEZE:
Stores the display in GROB G1, clears the screen, waits two seconds, then reloads the display on the screen and pauses. (Effectively useless without other graphic commands).

==→DISPLAY==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 →DISPLAY &lt;name&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Sends GROB &lt;name&gt; to the display. (Note that the arrow is going '''in to''' DISPLAY.)
* Usually used to output GROBs to the display after altering them using other graphic commands.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
See example for DISPLAY→.

==→GROB==

==GROBNOT==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 GROBNOT &lt;name&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Inverts the colors in GROB &lt;name&gt;, that is, switches all ON pixels OFF and vice-versa.
* Could be used to select buttons, for example, but is generally too slow for this purpose.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 ERASE:
 DISPLAY→ G0:
 GROBNOT G0:
 →DISPLAY G0:
 FREEZE:
This program will erase the screen (ie. turn all pixels OFF), then invert the colours (ie. turn all pixels ON), giving you a black screen.

==GROBOR==

==GROBXOR==

==MAKEGROB==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 MAKEGROB &lt;name&gt;; &lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt;
 &lt;hex-data&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Allows you to make a custom grob, pixel-by-pixel using hexadecimal.
* Much faster than regular drawing commands, so if you have the time to write your GROBs manually, it's strongly recommended. However, it does usually increase the size of the program far more than just using other drawing commands, although this does not affect compile time - so you need to decide which is more important, program size or program speed.
* Each [[w:Hexadecimal|hexadecimal]] digit (a number between 0-9, or a letter between A-F) represents a four-digit [[w:Binary numeral system|binary]] number, which in turn represents four pixels on the screen (where 1 is on and 0 is off). The following table illustrates the pixel on/off sequences produced by each hex digit:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''0:''' 0000 or □□□□&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''1:''' 1000 or ■□□□&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''2:''' 0100 or □■□□&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''3:''' 1100 or ■■□□&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''4:''' 0010 or □□■□&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''5:''' 1010 or ■□■□&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''6:''' 0110 or □■■□&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''7:''' 1110 or ■■■□&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''8:''' 0001 or □□□■&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''9:''' 1001 or ■□□■&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''A:''' 0101 or □■□■&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''B:''' 1101 or ■■□■&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''C:''' 0011 or □□■■&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''D:''' 1011 or ■□■■&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''E:''' 0111 or □■■■&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''F:''' 1111 or ■■■■&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;small&gt;Table detailing pixel patterns created by using different hex digits.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
* The syntax is quite counter-intuitive; the grob name (G0 for example) comes first, followed by a semicolon and a space, then the width and height measurements for the grob, separated by spaces (rather than the usual semicolons). After that, a new line '''must''' be created, and the hex-data begins, which is finally ended with the regular :. No newlines must be created whilst typing the hex-data, although the calculator will naturally wrap the data onto the next line anyway.
* '''Useful tip:''' To generate the MAKEGROB code for the entire screen, use other methods to draw the image you desire (eg. SKETCH mode), then press ON+PLOT to save a screenshot to G0. Now, go into HOME view and enter G0, then hit ENTER. Finally, select the text that has just appeared starting with MAKEGROB, and press F5 (COPY), then hit ENTER again. The code is now stored in the ''Editline'' program, and you can insert it into any other program by pressing VARS, scrolling down to Programs, selecting Editline, pressing F4 (VALUE), and pressing F6 (OK).
** Another idea is to crop this grob using SUB to create a sub-GROB, then typing the variable name (eg. G1) for the cropped GROB in HOME view. Use the above procedure to copy this MAKEGROB code into your program, and you will be able to save substantial amounts of space in the program that would otherwise have been taken up by 0s or other erroneous data. If only the calculator had some form of [[w:RLE|RLE]]..

'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 MAKEGROB G1; 12 12
 FFF10810899999910850A999168108FFF:

 ■■■■■■■■■■■■
 ■□□□□□□□□□□■
 ■□□□□□□□□□□■
 ■□□■■□□■■□□■
 ■□□■■□□■■□□■
 ■□□□□□□□□□□■
 ■□■□□□□□□■□■
 ■□□■■□□■■□□■
 ■□□□□■■□□□□■
 ■□□□□□□□□□□■
 ■■■■■■■■■■■■
The above MAKEGROB code translated into the creation of the GROB roughly approximated by the ASCII sketch above.

==EDITMAT==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 EDITMAT &lt;matrix&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Opens the edit matrix screen, allowing the user to input data into a matrix. &lt;matrix&gt; can be one of the ten matrix variables from M0 to M9.
* Essentially the same as PROMPT - but used for matrix input.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 MSGBOX &quot;This program multiplies two matrices.&quot;:
 MSGBOX &quot;Please enter the first matrix.&quot;:
 EDITMAT M1:
 MSGBOX &quot;Please enter the second matrix.&quot;:
 EDITMAT M2:
 M1*M2?M3:
 MSGBOX &quot;The result of the multiplication is stored in M3.&quot;
This program will multiply two matrices, as detailed in the MSGBOX commands.

==RANDMAT==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 RANDMAT &lt;matrix&gt;;&lt;#rows&gt;;&lt;#columns&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Generates a matrix in variable &lt;matrix&gt; of size &lt;#rows&gt; x &lt;#columns&gt;, setting each element to a random integer (apparently) from -9 to 9, inclusive.
* Essentially the same as PROMPT - but used for matrix input.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 RANDMAT M1;50;50:
Makes a really big matrix filled with random integers that wastes a fair bit of your calculator's memory, as well as drains the batter power writing all that info to memory. Useful!

'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 SCALE &lt;matrix&gt;;&lt;factor&gt;;&lt;row&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==BEEP==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 BEEP &lt;freq&gt;;&lt;time&gt;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Uses the calculator's [[w:Loudspeaker#Piezoelectric_speakers|piezoelectric beeper]] to beep at a frequency of &lt;freq&gt; Hz for &lt;time&gt; seconds.

'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 INT(RANDOM*9+1)?R:
 MSGBOX &quot;Guess the number between 1 and 10.&quot;
 WHILE A?R REPEAT
 PROMPT A:
 IF A==R THEN
 BEEP 400;.2:
 BEEP 600;.5:
 MSGBOX &quot;You win!&quot;:
 STOP:
 ELSE BEEP 600;.2:
 BEEP 400;.5:
 IF A&gt;R THEN MSGBOX &quot;Lower..&quot;:
 ELSE MSGBOX &quot;Higher..&quot;:
 ELSE END:
 ELSE END:END:
This program generates a random number from 1 to 10, and prompts the user for a guess. If the user guesses correctly, the calculator beeps twice with rising pitch (typical &quot;correct&quot; sound). Otherwise, it beeps twice with lowering pitch (typical &quot;wrong&quot; sound), and tells the user if the answer is higher or lower than what they specified.

==CHOOSE==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 CHOOSE &lt;variable&gt;;
 &quot;&lt;title-name&gt;&quot;;
 &quot;&lt;option-1&gt;&quot;;
 &quot;&lt;option-2&gt;&quot;;
 ...
 &quot;&lt;last-option&gt;&quot;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Allows the user to select from a set of options given on the screen.
* After two ;s, CHOOSE starts allocating spaces on the on-screen menu and assigning values to those spaces. Therefore, in the syntax example, &lt;option-1&gt; would have a value of 1 - if it were selected, &lt;variable&gt; would be set to 1.
* This option is best used in conjunction with CASE to define the effect of each option.

'''Dangers'''&lt;br&gt;
* CHOOSE starts with the current value of &lt;variable&gt; as the item selected. '''Therefore, it will be impossible to use the menu should the variable have a value that is not a positive integer, or is greater than the number of options.'''
* A simple workaround for the following is always inserting 1?&lt;variable&gt; at the start of the CHOOSE command, to ensure that the first option is selected by default.

==DISP==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 DISP &lt;line&gt;;&quot;&lt;text&gt;&quot;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Displays &lt;text&gt; on line number &lt;line&gt; (1 to 7).
* Although there is room for 8 lines after an ERASE, setting &lt;line&gt; as less than 1, non-integer, or more than 7 will result in the text simply not printing (no error message).
* DISPXY is able to handle printing on the &quot;8th line&quot;, should you require more room.
'''Dangers'''&lt;br&gt;
* DISP erases the contents of the entire line that it is about to print on, regardless of whether or not pixels have already been drawn in that area. Therefore, you should always use DISP first, should you intend to draw over it. DISPXY corrects this problem to a degree, although use of it still results in ''some'' whitespace being forced over your drawing.
* This can be used to your advantage should you wish to blank out a certain line of text, simply use DISP &lt;line&gt;;&quot; &quot;:. This can be advantageous as it will obfuscate your code (if you want to limit the alterations people make to your code), and because it is much faster than any other method (although it allows the least control).

'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 ERASE:DISP 1;&quot;Hello World!&quot;:
 FREEZE:
Displays the ubiquitous &quot;Hello World&quot; on the first line on the screen, after erasing the screen, and freezes the program at the end so that the user has time to read the message.

 1?A:1?B:ERASE:
 FOR X=1 TO 500;
 A+B?C:B?A:C?B:
 B/A?P:
 DISP 1;B&quot;:&quot;A:
 DISP 2;P:
'''Advanced:''' Approximates [[w:Golden ratio|phi]] using the ratio between increasing [[w:Fibonacci number|Fibonacci numbers]]. The ability of DISP to erase the line before displaying its payload creates an interesting-looking &quot;reiterative&quot; effect.

==DISPTIME==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 DISPTIME:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Displays the date and time in a message box.
* The time is stored in the TIME and DATE real variables.
** '''TIME''' syntax: hh.mmss (with hh in 24-hour time). For example, 2:30PM is 14.3000. Since the variable is an integer, the 0s at the end actually go on for 13 characters; this is because the TIME variable actually stores fractions of seconds, too. (Thus you could set 1PM as just 13, or 12:05:30.136 as 12.0530136.)
** '''DATE''' syntax: mm.ddyyyy. For example, 21st September, 2005 is 9.212005.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
This program is called &quot;TimeUtils&quot;.
 1?M:CHOOSE M;
 &quot;Display time&quot;;
 &quot;Set time&quot;:
 CASE
 IF M==1 THEN
 DISPTIME:STOP:END
 IF M==2 THEN
 MSGBOX &quot;Hour? (24h time)&quot;:
 PROMPT H:
 MSGBOX &quot;Minute?&quot;:
 PROMPT M:
 H+M/100?TIME:
 MSGBOX &quot;Set. Date?&quot;:
 PROMPT D:
 MSGBOX &quot;Month?&quot;:
 PROMPT M:
 MSGBOX &quot;Year?&quot;:
 PROMPT Y:
 D+M/100+Y/1000?DATE:
 MSGBOX &quot;Set.&quot;:RUN &quot;TimeUtils&quot;:END
 END:
This program is a multi-function application that allows you to both display and edit (correct) the current time. Most of it should be self-explanatory, given the information about the DATE and TIME variables in Details.

==EDITMAT==
See [[../Matrix_Commands#EDITMAT|EDITMAT]] under the [[../Matrix_Commands|matrix commands]] section for information on this command.

==FREEZE==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 FREEZE:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* Pauses the running of the program, waiting for input from a key.
* Best used after using drawing commands, or else the drawings will disappear from the screen straight away.
* For the readers who know more advanced programming languages, it is the same as GETKEY, but it does not return a value to the calculator (ie. cannot detect which key was pressed).

==GETKEY==
==INPUT==
==MSGBOX==
'''Syntax'''&lt;br&gt;
 MSGBOX &quot;&lt;message&gt;&quot;:
'''Detail'''&lt;br&gt;
* The simplest way of displaying a message on screen, requiring only the text to be displayed; however, this is its weakness - it offers almost no control.
* Automatically incorporates a FREEZE, that is, you need to press a key to get out of the MSGBOX.
'''Example'''&lt;br&gt;
 PROMPT A:
 MSGBOX &quot;You entered &quot;A&quot;.&quot;:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Oral presentations use many of the same techniques that are used in rhetorical writing. Planning your topic, researching, editing, reviewing, and revision are all important steps in producing a good oral presentation; the same as they are when writing an essay or research paper. 

The best way to ensure that your speech is a success is to have enthusiasm for your topic and to give yourself adequate time to develop that enthusiasm into a workable talk. 

==Introduction==
Once your topic has been decided upon and research is underway, it's time to think about how you plan to present your information. 

===Preparation===
Of the several angles that need to be addressed in regards to delivering a speech, the most important thing to keep in mind is, &quot;Who is my audience?&quot; Never underestimate the importance of knowing your audience.

If you're planning to present information about new advances in interactive role-playing games on the Internet to a group of senior citizens, chances are you will need to use different terminology and examples than you would with a college-age audience composed of aspiring Software Engineers. If your audience can't understand what you're trying to say, you'll find it much harder to accomplish your objective.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=Consider the following characteristics of your audience:
* Knowledge Base
* Age
* Race
* Gender
* Occupation
* Values &amp; Morals
|caption=Who is Your Audience?}}

This brings us to consideration number two: what is the purpose of your speech? Is it a call to action? Strictly to inform? To persuade? Just as you will adjust your language for various audiences, so will you use different rhetorical strategies to achieve different goals.

In tandem with keeping your information audience-appropriate and on topic, your decision to use visual aids such as Powerpoint, charts, or any kind of props (in the case of demonstration presentations) will have a sizable impact on your audience, and as such should be given careful thought.  

A question that you may want to ask yourself is, &quot;How do I want to present the information?&quot; You might want to give a bare-bones speech, have a Powerpoint presentation, or use exhibits to add character to your information. You also may ask, &quot;How much information can I present in the allotted amount of time?&quot; Sometimes starting a speech with something everyone can relate to helps to ease in the audience and make them more interested in what you will be discussing. Be sure to &quot;trim the fat&quot; off of your presentation if you are strapped for time. If you are running far over the amount of time that you have been allotted, you may need to re-assess your information and further narrow your scope. One of the most important things you should ask yourself is, &quot;What ideas and thoughts do I want to leave the audience with?&quot;  These are the key points that you want to center your presentation around.

Knowing your audience gives you the key to gain and hold their attention, which is a central task for any presenter. Use your knowledge of the audience's demographics to draw them into the presentation from the very first sentence. By knowing what sorts of examples and illustrations you can use to make the contents of your presentation relevant and interesting, you have unlocked the door to understanding and persuasion.

===Ways of Beginning a Speech===

When you begin your presentation, you want the audience to feel interested and invested in what you have to share.  The more interested you get them right off the bat, the more they are going to pay attention throughout the rest of the presentation. This can be done in a multitude of ways, but it is important to remember to keep your introduction relatively short; wordy introductions can lose your audience before you actually get to the speech itself. It is also important to remember that whatever opening line you choose, you must connect it to the content of your speech. 

The use of quotations is a tried-and-true way of introducing a subject--if it is done correctly. Here is an example using Albert Einstein:

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;After the nuclear bombs were dropped during World War II, the leading creator of this destructive force said, 'I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be  fought with sticks and stones.' Albert Einstein stated this after finally seeing the bombs' full power; for he knew that he very well may have had a hand in the end of the world.&quot;|caption=Opening with a quotation.}}

Startling statistics might help to open the eyes of your audience. Here is an example concerning incarceration rates:

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;By the end of 2004, 724 out of every 100,000 U.S. residents were incarcerated. The United States of America has the highest jailing rate in the entire world.&quot;|caption=Opening with a statistic.
}}

Sharing a personal experience is an effective, but risky way of opening an oral presentation. Use this option only if it's the right fit for your audience. For example, if you are presenting to a group of Video Game Design students at your school on the topic of fun game play elements, you might use a personal experience like this:

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;A couple years ago, there was this game that had just came out.  Everybody was talking about how awesome this game was and how sweet the graphics were.  So, I did what any gamer would do--drove directly to the store, picked up a copy of the game, brought it home, and popped it into my Xbox. My excitement heightened as the game loaded and the intro sequence played.  When the game started, I was absolutely astonished ... at how bad the game play was.  The game looked cool, but all you did was run around and hit the enemies in the head with a sword over and over again. 

That game was not fun; Let's make a game that is fun.&quot;
|caption=Opening with a personal anecdote.}}

Using a joke to start a presentation is often a good idea.  You just better hope that your audience thinks it's funny!  In most cases, this means keep your joke clean.  Also, try to make the joke pertain to the subject you are presenting on. Here is an example that you might use when doing a presentation on football:

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;Anyone who makes a bad call against the Detroit Lions risks ticking off their last remaining fan.&quot;
|caption=Opening with humor.}}

If the presentation is more formal, you may just want to give an overview of the main topics you will cover in your speech. Here is an example using college dropouts:

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;Today, I will be discussing college dropouts.  I will be going over the current rate of dropouts as well as the many common reasons for it.  I will also talk about the reasons to stay in college, like better knowledge, life experiences, and more pay in the future.&quot;
|caption=Opening with an overview.}}

==Methods of Presenting Your Speech==

When it comes time to present your speech, there are several methods of delivery to choose from. In most cases, your subject matter will be the main criteria for deciding whether to read verbatim, memorize your script, or work from cue cards. In the case of a scholarly presentation with an extensive amount of detail, you may choose to write out your speech and deliver it as written. If your goal is to persuade your audience through high-energy speaking and eloquent prose, you may choose to script and memorize your argument. When introducing an informal topic with which you are familiar, you may find that index cards and an outline will suffice.  No matter which way you choose to present your speech, you need to be '''prepared'''!

Written preparation can include notecards or a fully spelled-out speech.  In any case, it is essential that as a speaker, you provide clear talking points and transitions for your audience.  When you write an essay, your audience or readers have the advantage of clearly seeing your paragraph, section, and page breaks; when you speak to an audience, you must recreate this experience verbally.  To provide a recent example, President Barack Obama is known for numbering his extemporaneous responses to questions from the press or during election debates.  When outlining a proposed solution, he will clearly mark its steps with one, two, and three.  This rhetorical strategy is effective in helping his audience easily follow his logic and responses; though you can opt to use transitions that are somewhat more subtle, never forget that your audience cannot see the progression of your argument and you must visually outline it for them. 

===Manuscript Speaking===

Writing the content of your speech out word for word may be appropriate for certain situations. For instance, when you are presenting critical facts or statistics, having the data at your fingertips helps to prevent errors. While misquoting information might sound like a minor offense, under certain circumstances it can have grave repercussions, such as being sued for slander. Though in most cases incorrect information will only confuse your listeners and embarrass you, it's good to remember that such mistakes won't be tolerated in many professions, including law and politics. 

The drawback to a scripted speech is that the audience will almost certainly know that you are reading word for word. This has several drawbacks, including decreased eye contact and stilted delivery, both of which leech power away from your presentation and tend to create a feeling of disconnect between the listeners and the speaker.  

If giving a manuscript speech is necessary, practice is the best way to avoid a bad presentation. By reading your speech aloud several times, you will become more comfortable with the rhythm and inflections of your writing. Make sure that you are thinking about where and when you can make eye contact with your audience to underscore your points and add emphasis to important parts of your speech.  Particularly with a written speech, you can add visual cues to your speech to remind you when to look up or emphasize a certain point.

===Memorized Speaking===

When a presenter memorizes a speech, it's basically a manuscript speech minus the paper. Memorizing a speech can improve eye contact with an audience. Body language may also improve because the speaker has more freedom to move about the area, since papers/notes will not be used.

A problem posed by memorizing a speech arises when the presenter forgets the speech. This can cause an embarrassing, awkward situation and make the speaker appear inept. Plus, the speaker's tone tends to sound artificial and rehearsed.

If you choose to memorize a speech, you might want to have a sparse outline with you just to remind yourself of your talking points.

===Extemporaneous Speaking===

An extemporaneous speech (extemp speech) is delivered from a prepared outline or note cards. The outline and/or note cards include the main ideas and arguments of the speech. The only information that is typically copied word for word are quotes. Outlines and note cards should be used for keeping the presentation organized and for reminding the presenter what information needs to be provided.

Extemp speaking has many advantages compared to the other methods of delivery. 

For one, an extemporaneous speech sounds spontaneous because the presenter is not reading word for word. Glancing at an outline or a note card that has key ideas listed allows the presenter to add detail and personality to the information being presented. 

Second, similar to memorized speaking, eye contact and body language can increase. The speaker’s head is not down, buried in a manuscript. 

Third, the speaker is able to take in audience feedback and respond to it as it occurs. An audience tends to change moment by moment, and a good speaker can tell when more or less detail is needed for different parts of the presentation. 

In order to ensure an extemporaneous speech’s strength, it is important to practice presenting with the outline or note cards being used. Inexperienced speakers tend to worry that they will forget important information if they do not write it out on their outline/note card.  

Practicing your speech, even if it's just to your pet or mirror, will help increase your 
confidence level in both delivery and knowledge of the subject.

==Do's and Don'ts==
Now that you have familiarized yourself with the various methods of preparing and delivering oral presentations, it's time to discuss the best way to present your information. You may be familiar with Marshall McLuhan's adage &quot;the medium is the message.&quot; Don't forget that in the case of an oral presentation, you ARE the medium. In other words, no matter how well-researched and cunningly written, your speech will only be as professional as your look and manner suggest it is. Your appearance and delivery are just as important as the content of your presentation.

===Dress Code===
You've no doubt heard this from your high school guidance counselor, your parents, and a dozen brochures about successfully interviewing for employment, but it bears repeating: '''First impressions are important'''. It is imperative that you dress to impress. For most situations in which you will be delivering an oral presentation, this means &quot;Business Casual.&quot; 

For '''men''', business casual usually consists of a button-front shirt, tie, dress slacks, and dress shoes (blazer is optional). Men should also be clean-shaven or else properly groom their facial hair.  For '''women''', business casual includes a button-front shirt (or professional-looking sweater or top- on this point, women tend to have more business casual options than men), dress pants or skirt (of appropriate length), and dress shoes.  Both men and women should take care not to expose too much skin.

If the speech will be presented before an audience that will be dressed formally, ''wear a suit''. You should try to get plenty of sleep the night before your presentation, so that you will be fresh and well rested. Before approaching the podium, take a quick look in the mirror--Hair tidy? Teeth clean? Tie straight? Under no circumstances should hats or anything that obstructs eye contact with the audience be worn.

As with other elements of public speaking, consider what your particular audience will expect of you.  In some cases, dressing casually is entirely appropriate; in others, only a suit (for women and men) is acceptable.

===Delivering The Message===
When speaking to the audience, act poised and confident, even if that's not how you feel on the inside. Some of the most common &quot;tells&quot; that a person is ill at ease include fidgeting, throat clearing, and speaking too rapidly. Stand up straight and stay relatively still--don't shift your weight from foot to foot. Keep your hands quiet, and avoid putting them in your pockets. Also, try to prevent yourself from adjusting your shirt or glasses or from playing with your notecards, hair, or writing utensils.  Concentrate on keeping your breathing slow and even, and try to relax. Most importantly, make eye contact with the audience, '''not the floor'''.
You should be as confident in your vocal delivery as you are in your posture. Avoid saying &quot;Um&quot;, &quot;Uh&quot;, or &quot;Like&quot;. These words make you seem uncertain, unprepared, and undermine your credibility. Vary the tone of your voice and talk at a steady, conversational rate. Last, but not least, do not chew gum or suck on candy while speaking. If you're afraid that your mouth will go dry, it is acceptable to have a small glass of water at hand to sip discreetly.

Again, the most important preparation you can do is to practice your speech several times to a mirror, your pet, a friend, or family member.  The more comfortable you feel with your material, the more confident you will be when presenting it to an audience.

==Conclusion==
[[Image:Keriwowsmall.jpg|right|frame|&quot;WOW&quot; your audience!]]Leaving the audience with a bang is necessary in order to ensure a lasting impression. Remember, the last thing presented tends to be what the audience remembers the best.  The ending of a speech can be as important as the beginning and body. The conclusion should do what the introduction did, except in reverse.

===Ways of Ending a Speech===
After completing the presentation, the presenter should summarize the main points again without repeating verbatim what was said in the introduction. After that, you want to &quot;Wow&quot; your audience again with one of the techniques for introducing your speech.  This can include: a quotation, a startling statistic, a personal experience, a joke, or a formal closure. Particularly if you are presenting persuasive information, you may want to end your speech with a call to action.  What are you asking of your audience?  What can they do after listening to your speech?  Finally, asking for questions is a good way to minimize any confusion that the audience might have or bring to light any relevant connections which you may have overlooked.

===Thank Your Audience===
While this is one of the most important things to do at the end of a presentation, it is also one of the most forgotten things. Remember that the audience has given up their time to listen to you. They could have been anywhere else in the world doing anything they wanted to do, but they were there with you. You should appreciate that. An example of thanking your audience could look like this:

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=&quot;That is all I have for today.  I appreciate you giving me your time.  Thank you very much and have a great day.&quot;|caption=Ending with a thank-you.}}

A '''crumble''' is a type fruit dessert which usually features a layer of sweetened fruit covered by a loose, often oat-based, dough, which is &quot;crumbled&quot; on to the fruit. Unlike the layers in a [[Cookbook:Cobbler|cobbler]], the layers in a crumble are quite shallow. Once baked, the topping blends into the top of the fruit layer. Since there is generally not enough dough to completely cover the fruit, the baked result is a cracked topping with the color of the fruit seeping through.

Writing for business includes multiple types of formats including, but not limited to, cover letters, resumes, memos, e-mails, letters, proposals, business plans, and formal reports. This section will focus on how to be a successful business writer.

==Purpose of Business Writing==

The main purpose of business writing is to ''convince''. For example, as a professional business writer, you often find yourself explaining the value of a complex idea in order to obtain agreement among readers. Or, you find yourself crafting a document intended to persuade people and rouse them to action. 

In other respects, business writing is much like any other form of writing that includes pre-writing or brainstorming, writing and revising. The most important aspects of business writing are clear and concise writing and getting the message across in the best way. As with all writing, it is important to keep the audience in mind when coming up with the best format to get the message across.

==Audience==

The most important concept to keep in mind when writing for business is who your target audience is.  You need to tailor your writing to fit different audiences in different situations.  If you address the document's specific target audience in terms it understands, your document will have a better chance of achieving its goal.

Every business document has a purpose. You could be trying to persuade your boss that you are due a raise in one instance, and trying to persuade the HR Department that the company picnic would have more participation if it were held at a lake in another instance.  In both instances, the language and way you would approach each is going to differ.

==Deadlines==

Much, if not all, professional business writing is performed against a deadline. In fact, making a deadline with time to spare is the hallmark of a pro. That act alone inspires a sense of confidence in a business that is often as persuasive as the document itself. So, a good rule of thumb for business writers would be 'better a B+ document that arrives on time than an A that's late.'

== Memos and E-mails ==

Writing memos and e-mails in a business setting is slightly different than writing to a friend or family member. The biggest difference is that in a business setting, the writing must be professional or formal. A big misconception about e-mailing in business is that formality is not important. Grammar and composition are both important aspects. However, should you receive an email of memo which contains compositional and grammatical flaws, it may be rude or unwise to point these out to the author. Memos and e-mails have a similar approach. The purpose of both is to get a certain message across. This section will cover deciding when it is appropriate to use either a memo or e-mail, content, pre-writing techniques, and effectiveness.

===Memos===
The memo or memorandum has a few types. The memos can be short notes, reports, plans or proposals. The standard memo is most effective when attempting to inform many people within the same organization of upcoming events, changes, thoughts, or ideas.  

Most memos will have five basic elements:
*The organization's logo or letterhead
*The &quot;to&quot; line
*The &quot;from&quot; line
*The subject line  
Note: When writing your subject line, make sure it is called something accurate, unique and specific.  Name your memo something informative.
*The date line

The first sentence of your memo you should clearly state your purpose.  Be concise and direct.  

'''Example''': An example from &quot;How to write it? (pp.167)&quot;

 To:    All Department Heads
 From:  Joan Alexander
 Date:  May 10, 2007
 Subject:Weekly Department Head Meeting, May 30, 2007, 8:00 am. Room 108
 Agenda: 
     1.Vote on the vacation policy.
     2.Elect a media spokesperson.
     3.Introduce the new vice president of marketing, Mark Halpern.  


'''Example''': The purpose of this memo is to request authorization to travel to Minneapolis to visit the Museum of Natural History to learn more about dinosaur fossils.

Use headings throughout your memo to help the reader decide what they want to read and understand the information they are being presented.  Headings can also help the reader understand the purpose of the section (i.e. summary).

If your memo has a lot of information or if it is really long, you may consider summarizing the memo.  This can help readers understand the body of the memo, allow readers to skip information that is not relevant to them or to remind the reader of the memos main points. A good memo will record the clear main ideas and every important decision. 

Keep in mind your audience when writing your memo.  You may need to provide background information or explain the events that led to the situation to which the memo is regarding.

===E-mails===
Emails are fast, cheap, easy to use and digital.  Because of its widespread use, here are some things to keep in mind when writing &quot;business&quot; emails.  
*Use an appropriate level of formality.
*Keep messages brief.  If you are replying to an email, don't repeat information from the email, instead establish a general context of the email.  Also, if sending the email to more than one person, you may want to consider blocking the original author's name for privacy's sake (BCC = Blind Carbon-Copy).
*Be careful when writing.  Because email is often informal, it is easy for them to become sloppy.  Make sure you read your email before sending it.
*In formal business email, avoid the use of characters to create emotion faces, such as :), Orz, or &gt; &lt;. 
*Use the subject line.  All business emails should have a subject so the reader can decide quickly whether or not they need to read the email.
*Don't use all capital letters or use annoying backgrounds.  Keep your emails simple.  Try to stay away from using italics, bolds or underlining.  Even if your email supports these options, others may not.
*Don't forward a message without the permission of the author.
*Above all, have something to say.  Don't send emails just for fun or just to reply agreeing with the writer (unless this is requested or expected).  In other words, don't send a message just to feel like you are part of the conversation.
*Remember, if you are writing a memo or email during working hours or on a company computer, the company OWNS this material (and has the fully legal right to inspect it).  Avoid overtly personal and/or sensitive content in your email while at work.  If you are concerned about this possibility, look into message encryption.

== Cover Letters and Resumes ==

Writing a resume or a cover letter is basically a sales pitch to a potential employer.  You need to acknowledge that they have a need (an empty position), and that you are ''the'' perfect fit for them or at least close enough of a fit to bring into their office for an interview.

=== Cover Letters ===

The cover letter and resume will form employers’ first impressions of a potential employee. These documents will be the first thing the employer sees, therefore, make every attempt to ensure the documents are without errors (grammatical, spelling, punctuation, etc.). Mistakes in the resume and cover letter are one of the biggest reasons why job seekers fail to secure an interview. If the potential employer finds mistakes, they will have the feeling that the applicant probably will not take the time to be careful with their work when they are on the job. 

The cover letter is an opportunity to expand on any specific points in the resume that deserve more attention and can be connected to aspects of the desired position. Remember, there is likely a large pool of people applying for the same position. Use the cover letter effectively to present yourself and distinguish your application from the rest.

Any time a resume is sent in the mail, it must be accompanied by a cover letter. The cover letter is an important factor in getting your resume past the first barrier. The cover letter must be customized for each opportunity. It can also be an opportunity to explain any problems,questions, and things that may not be clear in your resume (such as gaps in employment).  


'''Why is the cover letter so important?'''

The cover letter:

• is your opportunity to personalize your resume and target your skills to the specific employer; 

• connects your past experiences listed on your resume to your potential future position at a new job;

• highlights your strengths, accomplishments, and sparkling personality;

• can be tailored to the needs of the specific company to which you are applying.


'''Cover Letter Formats'''

'''Employer Invited Letter:''' Use the employer invited letter when an employer has requested a resume. This is often in response to a classified ad or publicized listing. This style focuses on matching your qualifications to the advertised requirements of the position.

'''Uninvited or Cold Contact Letter:''' Use the uninvited letter to contact employers who have not advertised or published job openings. The focus is on matching your qualifications to the perceived needs of the employer based on labor market research. This strategy requires that a phone or personal contact with the employer either precede or follow the sending of the resume and cover letter.

'''Referral Letter:''' Use the referral letter to contact employers to whom you have been referred. The effective job seeker will receive referrals to many job opportunities through networking and informational interviews. The referral may be to a specific job opening (advertised or unadvertised) or to an employer who may not be hiring. In a referral letter the individual who provided the referral is mentioned in the letter. 


'''Specific points to address in the cover letter.'''

*Let the company know why you are contacting them. Your intent may seem obvious, but tell the employer you are interested in a job at their company. Opening a letter without stating you intent may seem awkward. Whenever possible address the cover letter to a specific person by name and title.   

*Let the employer know how you heard about the open position. For example, &quot;I am interested in X position. I heard about/discovered the opening online/in the newspaper/from one of their a current employees. It is likely that the company has more than one open position so make sure to identify the specific position in which you are interested.  

*Include a detailed description of your educational and work experience. Be sure to highlight the areas in your work or educational history that apply directly or closely to your desired position. You can put either paragraph first, but put your strongest information first. If you have a lot of work experience related to the job, then put your work experience first. If your educational experience makes you more strongly qualified, consider putting that information first. Remember, extra-curricular activities can be very valuable, if they are applicable to the position.

*Use terms from the ad that are clearly relevant to you and your experience. Take a cue from the job ad and emphasize how you are specifically qualified for the position. If the job requires a degree in Management and you have a Master's Degree in Management, emphasize that point. Writing your cover letter specifically for the job for which you are applying, will stand out more than a person who has a generic cover letter. Utilize action words and descriptive statements to convey your qualifications and career objectives.

*Reemphasize your interest in the position. Include a polite, but also confident request for an interview. Ask that they contact you and be sure to include how you'd like to be contacted (i.e. give your phone number and/or your email address. 
You may also want to state the best time you can be reached. It is also a good idea to reference your resume, if you haven't already done so.  

*Remember, be confident! If you don't sound like you think you are qualified for the position, why should a potential employer? Your cover letter needs to persuade the employer that you have skills and abilities that are useful to the company.

Dear Ms. Nelson:

I am interested in applying for your Administrative Assistant opening I found posted on the Career
Builder website.  Please accept the enclosed resume as my application for the position.

I am accustomed to a fast-paced environment where deadlines are a priority and handling multiple jobs

committee for which I was responsible.  I enjoy a challenge and work hard to attain goals.  Constant 
communication with all levels of management, as well as constituents and customers, has strengthened 
my interpersonal skills.  

I know I can contribute to the success of the Northern Newspapers.

I would welcome an opportunity to expand on my qualifications, which include:

* Extensive editing and proofreading skills
* Working both independently and as part of a team
* Substantial computer experience
* Having held various positions that emphasized problem-solving, multi-tasking and attention to detail; and
* Bachelor of Arts degrees in English.

I am enthusiastic about and genuinely interested in this position.  I know that my background and 
skills fit the qualities you are looking for in a candidate.  Please contact me at (555) 555-5555 or 
at my e-mail address (j-j-doe@msn.com) to set up a time for us to meet in person.


Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely,



Jane Doe

'''Other Tips:''' 

The cover letter and resume should be no more than a page.

Be creative, original and professional. Avoid using templates and standardized cover letters from books or websites. 

If you are asked to supply additional materials or references, do so promptly. 

Double check spelling and triple check any names and titles.

=== Resumes ===

[[Image:Wooden_hourglass.jpg|thumb|200px|Hourglass in wooden stand]]
Unlike cover letters, resumes are a brief outline used by hiring managers to ''scan'' a potential employee.  Think of the resume as a &quot;snapshot&quot; of your most relevant work and educational experience. Just like your cover letter, you want to bring out aspects of previous positions that relate to the one you are hoping to obtain.

Resumes need to be brief and descriptive at the same time.  How are you going to manage that?  You will need to be very selective in your word choice.  Each resume usually gets under a one minute chance to make an impression.  You should generally be able to get everything that you need to say in one page.  Make sure the pertinent information really stands out.  If you glance at your resume and can't find what's important right away, someone else will have a hard time finding the information that's important.  

Hiring managers expect that your resume be typed or printed, neat, easy to read, clearly outlined.  Don't use bright colors of ink or paper.  Make sure it looks professional.

There are several elements to a resume:

*Identification - Include your name, address, e-mail, phone number.

*Objective - Write a clear goal, avoid generalities.  Objectives are not necessary, but they are really helpful when applying for a volunteer position, internship or other positions that are a little more vague than a job opportunity.  If your objective states you want a job, don't include it, but rather specify the particular field of employment.

*Employment - Include your skills and responsibilities, with what equipment you worked.  The most important thing to include here is what you gained from your employment, the results of your experience.  Use an active voice and strong verbs.

*Education - Include information about your degree and the institution.  Again, make sure you talk about the results of your education, not just that your received an education.

*Interests and Activities - Make sure these are relevant to the job and demonstrate the personal impact you made as part of the group or working on a project.  Don't just include random hobbies. 

*References - There are a variety of opinions about whether or not to include references on the resume. Most employers are aware that they can request references from the job applicant at any point throughout the interview and hiring process. The job application itself, also may ask for references and their contact information. It is important to utilize the &quot;white space&quot; on your resume most effectively. You can list your references or write &quot;available upon request&quot;.  If you choose to list your references on a separate sheet of paper, make sure your name is on all sheets in case the pages get separated. To provide continuity between your cover letter, resume and references list, consider using the same header with your name and contact information on all three documents.   

'''How to get started:''' 

1. '''Define your objective.''' What position do you want to be hired for with the resume you will be working on? Resumes should always be customized to reflect the skills related to the desired position. A resume for a human resources position should look different than a resume for a counseling position.

2. '''Identify and evaluate your audience.''' Who in the company will most likely be viewing your resume first: a human resources representative, the CEO or the district manager? What skills, qualities and knowledge will your audience look for?

3. '''Prioritize your selling points.''' You have considered who your audience is going to be and what they will be looking for, now consider what areas in your work and educational experience best match the desired skills, qualities and knowledge. Brainstorm the key buzz words and action verbs that would best highlight your relevant qualifications.

4. '''Showcase your successes.''' Every employer wants a winner on their team. Demonstrate your successes (e.g. college degrees, educational honors, scholarship winnings, job promotions, leadership and community involvement and any other relevant awards/recognition). 

5. '''Choose your resume format and layout.''' What resume format (chronological, functional or combination) will best showcase your qualifications for the job. How can the layout be designed to best highlight so that the employer will quickly notice your selling points?

6. '''Create, Critique and Revise.''' Nothing good is ever written. It is always rewritten. Start the resume writing process as early as possible. Although your resume will always be a work in progress, revising will continually improve the final product.  Ask a career advisor, professor, parent or room mates seriously edit your resume. Any typo, spelling and grammatical error or spacing mistake should be improved. Your goal should be to have your resume error free.

7. '''Ensure the printing looks professional.''' Typing your resume is an absolute must. Print your resume on a laser printer and use a heavier paper stock. 


'''Questions to help jog your memory about your college activities for your resume:'''

•Did you win any academic scholarships? What were the winning criteria?

•Were you on the Dean’s list?

•Do you have a high GPA?

•What major (s) and/or minor (s) did you complete?

•Worked while a student to help fund your education?

•Completed an internship?

•Active in student organizations? Held any positions of office/leadership? If so, what were your responsibilities?

•Played sports? Captain? All conference?

•Volunteer/community service?

•Summer employment?

•Student newspaper, radio station, or television station?

•Wrote articles for a publication? Had work published?

•Created a web site?

•Conducted original research?

•Presented papers, served on panels?

•Helped organize a special event or conference?

•Research assistant or teaching assistant?

•Theatre production? Debate team? Choir? Band?

•Individual tutoring?

•Field service/practicum as part of your major? 


'''Using Key Action Verbs'''

What is an action verb? Action verbs describe achievements or results in a concise and persuasive manner. 


The following job description uses a non-action verb:

Was the supervisor of ten employees.

The next job description uses an action verb:

Supervised ten employees. 


The job description using the action verb is more concise (three words shorter). Concise writing is easier for the reader to understand and carries more impact and power. 


Use action verbs as the first word of each bullet point in your resume to emphasize job descriptions in your resume.  Examples:

•Developed and wrote content for the organization’s website

•Created and coordinated special events generating product awareness and increased sales

•Evaluated company’s marketing and public relation campaigns’ impact &amp; implementation.


It is common for students to be too brief in their description of their skills, qualities and traits. Key action words will help you best describe and sell your skills and abilities. 

1. First read through the entire list below and write down the action verbs (skills) employers look for in your field or particular position. 

2. Next, read through the entire list a second time and write down the action verbs you have used in the experience you are describing on your resume. 

3. Look back at your written list and highlight the words that appear on both lists. Incorporate these words into your resume and cover letter.

== Follow up or Thank you letters ==

After an interview, take that time to write a thank you letter.  The follow up letter can do more good for you in less time than most other aspects of the application/interview process.  Thank the interviewer for taking time out of their schedule to meet with you.  Also, make sure to emphasize your particular qualifications and/or restate your interest in the position.  This letter puts your name in front of the interviewer again and also shows that you are truly interested in the position.  Plus, if you are basically '''tied''' in contention for the job with another person, the thank you letter may tip the scales in your favor.   

Mail the thank you letter within a day of your interview. Not only will this help you in remember the details of your interview, it will also help to ensure that your potential interviewer '''sees your thank you letter''' before making a final decision about the position.

'''When to Write Thank You Letters:'''

A thank you letter should be written after an interview, when someone provides or sends you information at your request, when a contact was particularly helpful to you, or any other contact that you would like to express thanks and develop a good relationship with.

'''Writing Your Thank You Letter:'''

The body of your thank you letter is really a “sales” letter.  It is an opportunity to restate why you want the job, to reiterate your best qualifications that match the job requirements, and how you will make significant contributions to the establishment.  A thank you letter is also the perfect opportunity to discuss anything that your interviewer neglected to ask you or that you neglected to answer as thoroughly as you could have.  

'''Customize Your Thank You Letters:'''

It’s very important to keep your audience in mind when writing your thank you letter.  Typically your thank you letters are typed but research suggests that managers like hand written thank you notes also.  

In addition to thanking the person you talked with, thank you letters also reinforce the fact that you want the job. 

'''Follow Up Letter to Recap Important Information:'''

Remind individuals who attended the meeting of the main events and important dates that were discussed.  Remind individuals who attended an important business event of the discussions that were made.  This helps keep the work flowing and everyone on the same page.  This also promotes further discussion and collaboration.  

'''Follow-up Letter to announce a special Offer:'''

This type of letter helps improve your relationship with a new customer.  Remind the customer that you are willing to help them by stating the advantages that your company can offer.  Thank the customer, or announce the special sale or limited time offer.  Remind the customer why you are a good business to work with.  

'''Follow-up Letter to Remind Readers of Important Events:'''

Make sure to include the date, time, location of the event, and any other important information that the reader needs to have in order to attend the event.

Northern Newspapers, Inc.

Othertown, MN 56789


Dear Ms. Hall,

I would like to express my appreciation for your courtesy in extending to me an interview 
this Monday for the position of Administrative Assistant with your Editorial Department.

As a result of our interview, I am convinced that the position of Administrative 
Assistant at Northern Newspapers, Inc. is exactly the kind of challenge and opportunity 
I am seeking.  As you may recall, my experience in editorial work at Company B coupled 
with my Legislative Assistant expertise with Company C will be a real benefit to you and 
the rest of the Editorial Department at Northern Newspapers, Inc.  

Thank you again for your time and consideration.  I am looking forward to hearing from you
soon.  I can be reached at (555)555-5555 for another interview or to answer any more questions
you may have for me.

Sincerely,



Jane Doe

== Other business letters  ==

Besides writing a letter to express appreciation for an interview, there are several other types of follow up letters.  Here are some tips for these types of letters.

*Letter accepting a job offer - Express appreciation for the offer.  Show enthusiasm for the position.  Repeat the major terms of your employment such as start date, job title, or salary.

*Letter of rejection in response to a job offer - Again, express your appreciation for the offer.  If it's appropriate, explain your reason for declining the offer.  Remember, at some point in the future, you may want to work for this company, so be polite with your rejection.

*Letter acknowledging a rejection - Why bother?  This letter maintains good relations with the company.  You might get a phone call later on saying that the first choice candidate wasn't able to take the position.

== Proposals, Business Plans and Formal Reports ==

Proposals, business plans and formal reports can be a critical part of your business career. All of these may deal with important outcomes.  The goal of all of these is to persuade the readers into agreeing with your ideas.  Often times, you are trying to gain something from the readers, such as money, equipment or help.

===Considerations===
When starting a proposal, the first thing to consider is what your goals are.  If you are asked to write a proposal for someone, make sure you are clear on what their goals and requirements are.

There are four main elements that must be considered with your goals.
# What are the immediate goals and how do they relate to the long-term goals?
# What costs or risks are involved with writing the proposal? This includes time and people needed.  Do not forget to explore hidden cost opportunities.
# What kinds of resources are you going to need? Are those resources readily available?
# What will come from an unsuccessful proposal? Will it be helpful if only some goals are met?

After considering your goals, there are still many more things to think about.  You must take into consideration the readers, your argument, feasibility, and action.

===Readers===
The more you know about your readers, the more you can tailor your report to appeal to them.  If you are lucky, you already know a lot about the reader because they wanted you to write the proposal and have given you specific guidelines.  However if you do not know much about your readers, then you better do some research on them.  It is important to know what form of research they will be the most receptive to.  Surveys may satisfy one reader, while another reader may not find them to be as credible.

; Argument : An argument can be summed up as what the main issue is and the importance of that issue.  You need to prove to your readers the significance of the issue.  You must convince your readers that your issue needs their attention or help.  You need to inform them of the issue, tell them why they should care, what they can do to help, the benefits of their help, and why they should find you credible.

; Feasibility : In your report, often as part of your argument, you will have to convince the readers of the feasibility of the issue.  Included in this would be offering alternative plans, addressing the costs and risks involved, as well as the resources needed.  You should be able to identify why your plan is the best option.

; Action : You will also need to include a plan of action in your report.  Most proposals are asking the readers for something.  You will need to tell the readers exactly what it is that you want them to do.

===What is included in a proposal?===
Cover, cover letter, table of contents, executive summary, appendix, and graphics.

; Cover : The cover page should include the title of the proposal, who the proposal is for, who the proposal is by, and the date.

; Cover letter : The cover letter is used to introduce the formal report.  It is often less formal than the report itself.  The letter usually includes an introduction of the topic and how it was authorized, a brief description of the plan, highlights of the report's findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

; Table of contents : The table of contents is just as it sounds, a table of the proposal's content and page numbers.  In the table of contents you should include section headings/topics and the page they can be found on.  Be sure to include leaders (numbers, dots or bullet-points) to link the section with the corresponding page number.

; Executive summary : The executive summary is a brief overview of the proposal.  You should summarize your main points, you should begin with your purpose and follow the order of your proposal.  Make sure to avoid including non essential information.  The executive summary should not be longer than 10 percent of the length of the proposal.  With proposals that are 10 pages or less, it may not be necessary to include an executive summary.

; Appendix : An appendix is pretty much any supporting material that you either reference in your proposal or may be supporting sources that be relevant to some readers and not others.  You may choose to include survey forms, other reports, tables of data, or any related material.  They are named Appendix A, B, C, etc.

; Graphics : While graphics are not a must, they are greatly appreciated.  Graphics help to break up all of the text in order to give the reader's eyes a little break.  You may choose to include a few small charts or graphs in your reports also.  Just be sure that the graphics are relevant to the proposal.

===Some tips to consider while writing your proposal...===
# Be clear on your topic.  Do not try to cover too many aspects in one proposal.  Stick to the most important so that you can be clear and concise.
# Create a phrase that will draw in your readers.  Pick an aspect of your report that should interest you readers and mention it early on to gain their interest.
# Make sure to include any background information that may be necessary in order to understand the proposal.
# Give yourself enough time to finish the proposal to the best of your ability.  You do not want to be in a time crunch while writing such an important document.
# You should not start writing until all of your research has been conducted and you have reached all of your conclusions.
# All basic writing standards apply... you should revise and edit, be consistent with verb tense, and avoid using &quot;I&quot; or &quot;we&quot; because you want the proposal to be objective and credible.

So far we explained that internally data is stored in a way the hardware can read as zeros and ones, bits. That data is conceptually divided and labeled in accordance to the number of bits in each set. We must explain that since data can be interpreted in a variety of sets according to established formats as to represent meaningful information. This ultimately required that the programmer is capable of differentiate to the compiler what is needed, this is done by using the different types.

A variable can refer to simple values like integers called a ''primitive type'' or to a set of values called a ''composite type'' that are made up of [[w:primitive types|primitive types]] and other [[w:composite types|composite types]]. Types consist of a set of valid values and a set of valid operations which can be performed on these values. A variable must declare what type it is before it can be used in order to enforce value and operation safety and to know how much space is needed to store a value.

Major functions that type systems provide are:
* '''Safety''' - types make it impossible to code some operations which cannot be valid in a certain context. This mechanism effectively catches the majority of common mistakes made by programmers. For example, an expression &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Hello, Wikipedia&quot;/1&lt;/tt&gt; is invalid because a [[w:string literal|string literal]] cannot be divided by an [[w:integer|integer]] in the usual sense. As discussed below, strong typing offers more safety, but it does not necessarily guarantee complete safety (see [[w:type-safety|type-safety]] for more information).
* '''Optimization''' - static type checking might provide useful information to a compiler. For example, if a type says a value is aligned at a multiple of 4, the memory access can be optimized.
* '''Documentation''' - using types in languages also improves [[w:documentation|documentation]] of code. For example, the declaration of a variable as being of a specific type documents how the variable is used. In fact, many languages allow programmers to define semantic types derived from [[w:primitive type|primitive type]]s; either composed of elements of one or more primitive types, or simply as aliases for names of primitive types.
* '''Abstraction''' - types allow programmers to think about programs in higher level, not bothering with low-level implementation. For example, programmers can think of strings as values instead of a mere array of bytes.
* '''Modularity''' - types allow programmers to express the interface between two subsystems. This localizes the definitions required for interoperability of the subsystems and prevents inconsistencies when those subsystems communicate.

==== Standard types ====
There are five basic ''primitive types'' called '''standard types''', specified by particular keywords, that store a single value. These types stand isolated from the complexities of class type variables, even if the syntax of utilization at times brings them all in line, standard types do not share class properties (i.e.: don't have a constructor). 

The type of a variable determines what kind of values it can store:

*&lt;tt&gt;bool&lt;/tt&gt; - a boolean value: true; false
*&lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; - Integer: -5; 10; 100
*&lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; - a character in some encoding, often something like ASCII, ISO-8859-1 (&quot;Latin 1&quot;) or ISO-8859-15: 'a', '=', 'G', '2'.
*&lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; - floating-point number: 1.25; -2.35*10^23
*&lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; - double-precision floating-point number: like float but more decimals

{{NOTE|A &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; variable cannot store sequences of characters (strings), such as &quot;C++&quot; ({'C', '+', '+', '\0'}); it takes 4 &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; variables (including the null-terminator) to hold it. This is a common confusion for beginners. There are several types in C++ that store string values, but we will discuss them later.}}

The &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; primitive data types are called 'floating point' types and are used to represent real numbers (numbers with decimal places, like 1.435324 and 853.562).  Floating point numbers and floating point arithmetic can be very tricky, due to the nature of how a computer calculates floating point numbers.

{{NOTE|note=Don't use floating-point variables where discrete values are needed. Using a float for a loop counter is a great way to shoot yourself in the foot. Always test floating-point numbers as &lt;tt&gt;&lt;=&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;, never use an exact comparison (&lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;!=&lt;/tt&gt;).}}

==== Definition vs. declaration ====
There is an important concept, the distinction between the declaration of a variable and its definition, two separated steps involved in the use of variables. The declaration announces the properties (the type, size, etc.), on the other hand the definition causes storage to be allocated in accordance to the declaration.

Variables as function, classes and other constructs that require declarations may be declared many times, but each may only be defined one time.

{{NOTE|There are ways around the definition limitation but uses and circumstances that may require it are vary rare or too specific that forgetting to interiorize the general rule is a quick way to get into errors that may be hard to resolve.}}

This concept will be further explained and with some particulars noted (such as {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}}) as we introduce other components. Here are some examples, some include concepts not yet introduced, but will give you a broader view:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
    int an_integer;                                 // defines an_integer
    extern const int a = 1;                         // defines a
    int function( int b ) { return b+an_integer; }  // defines function and defines b
    struct a_struct { int a; int b; };              // defines a_struct, a_struct::a, and a_struct::b
    struct another_struct {                         // defines another_struct
      int a;                                        // defines nonstatic data member a
      static int b;                                 // declares static data member b
      another_struct(): a(0) { } };                 // defines a constructor of another_struct
    int another_struct::b = 1;                      // defines another_struct::b
    enum { right, left };                           // defines right and left 
    namespace FirstNamespace { int a; }             // defines FirstNamespace  and FirstNamespace::a
    namespace NextNamespace = FirstNamespace ;      // defines NextNamespace 
    another_struct MySruct;                         // defines MySruct
    extern int b;                                   // declares b
    extern const int c;                             // declares c
    int another_function( int );                    // declares another_function
    struct aStruct;                                 // declares aStruct
    typedef int MyInt;                              // declares MyInt
    extern another_struct yet_another_struct;       // declares yet_another_struct
    using NextNamespace::a;                         // declares NextNamespace::a
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Declaration ====
C++ is a '''statically typed''' language. Hence, any variable cannot be used without specifying its type. This is why the type figures in the declaration. This way the compiler can protect you from trying to store a value of an incompatible type into a variable, e.g. storing a string in an integer variable. Declaring variables before use also allows spelling errors to be easily detected. Consider a variable used in many statements, but misspelled in one of them. Without declarations, the compiler would silently assume that the misspelled variable actually refers to some other variable. With declarations, an &quot;Undeclared Variable&quot; error would be flagged. Another reason for specifying the type of the variable is so the compiler knows how much space in memory must be ''allocated'' for this variable.

The simplest variable declarations look like this (the parts in []s are optional):

 ''[specifier(s)]'' ''type'' ''variable_name'' ''[ = initial_value]'';

To create an integer variable for example, the syntax is
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int sum; 
&lt;/source&gt;

where sum is the name you made up for the variable. This kind of statement is called a declaration. It ''declares'' &lt;tt&gt;sum&lt;/tt&gt; as a variable of type &lt;tt&gt;'''int'''&lt;/tt&gt;, so that &lt;tt&gt;sum&lt;/tt&gt; can store an integer value. Every variable has to be declared before use and it is common practice to declare variables as close as possible to the moment where they are needed. This is unlike languages, such as C, where all declarations must precede all other statements and expressions.

In general, you will want to make up variable names that indicate what you plan to do with the variable. For example, if you saw these variable declarations:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char firstLetter; 
char lastLetter; 
int hour, minute; 
&lt;/source&gt;

you could probably make a good guess at what values would be stored in them. This example also demonstrates the syntax for declaring multiple variables with the same type in the same statement: hour and minute are both integers (''int'' type). Notice how a comma separates the variable names.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int a = 123;
int b (456);
&lt;/source&gt;

Those lines also declare variables, but this time the variables are ''initialized'' to some value. What this means is that not only is space allocated for the variables but the space is also filled with the given value. The two lines illustrate two different but equivalent ways to initialize a variable. The assignment operator '=' in a declaration has a subtle distinction in that it assigns an initial value instead of assigning a new value. The distinction becomes important especially when the values we are dealing with are not of simple types like integers but more complex objects like the input and output streams provided by the &lt;tt&gt;iostream&lt;/tt&gt; class.

The expression used to initialize a variable need not be constant. So the lines:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int sum;
sum = a + b;
&lt;/source&gt;

can be combined as:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int sum = a + b;
&lt;/source&gt;

or:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int sum (a + b);
&lt;/source&gt;

Declare a floating point variable 'f' with an initial value of 1.5:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
float f = 1.5 ;
&lt;/source&gt;

Floating point constants should always have a '.' (decimal point) somewhere in them.  Any number that does not have a decimal point is interpreted as an integer, which then must be converted to a floating point value before it is used.

For example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
double a = 5 / 2;
&lt;/source&gt;

will not set a to 2.5 because 5 and 2 are integers and integer arithmetic will apply for the division, cutting off the fractional part.
A correct way to do this would be:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
double a = 5.0 / 2.0;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also declare floating point values using scientific notation.  The constant .05 in scientific notation would be &lt;math&gt;5 \times 10^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.  The syntax for this is the base, followed by an e, followed by the exponent.  For example, to use .05 as a scientific notation constant:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
double a = 5e-2;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{NOTE|Single letters can sometimes be a bad choice for variable names when their purpose cannot be determined. However, some single-letter variable names are so commonly used that they're generally understood. For example &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;j&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;k&lt;/tt&gt; are commonly used for loop variables and iterators; &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; is commonly used to represent the number of some elements or other counts; &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; are commonly used for strings (that don't have any other meaning associated with them, as in utility routines); &lt;tt&gt;c&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;d&lt;/tt&gt; are commonly used for characters; and &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; are commonly used for Cartesian co-ordinates.}}

Below is a program storing two values in integer variables, adding them and displaying the result:

{{:C++ Programming/Code/Variables/Examples/Adds two numbers and prints their sum}}

or, if you like to save some space, the same above statement can be written as:

==== Modifiers ====
There are several modifiers that can be applied to data types to change the range of numbers they can represent.

===== const =====
A variable declared with this specifier cannot be changed (as in read only). Either local or class-level variables (''scope'') may be declared &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; indicating that you don't intend to change their value after they're initialized. You declare a variable as being constant using the &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; keyword. Global &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; variables have static linkage. If you need to use a global constant across multiple files the best option is to use a special header file that can be included across the project.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const unsigned int DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7 ; 
&lt;/source&gt;

declares a positive integer constant, called &lt;tt&gt;DAYS_IN_WEEK&lt;/tt&gt;, with the value 7. Because this value cannot be changed, you must give it a value when you declare it. If you later try to assign another value to a constant variable, the compiler will print an error.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int main(){
  const int i = 10;

  i = 3;            // ERROR - we can't change &quot;i&quot;
 
  int &amp;j = i;       // ERROR - we promised not to
                    // change &quot;i&quot; so we can't
                    // create a non-const reference
                    // to it

  const int &amp;x = i; // fine - &quot;x&quot; is a const
                    // reference to &quot;i&quot;
 
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The full meaning of &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; is more complicated than this; when working through pointers or references, &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; can be applied to mean that the object pointed (or  referred) to will not be changed ''via that pointer'' or ''reference''.  There may be other names for the object, and it may still be changed using one of those names so long as it was not originally defined as being truly &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt;.

It has an advantage for programmers over &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; command because it is understood by the compiler, not just substituted into the program text by the preprocessor, so any error messages can be much more helpful.

With pointer it can get messy...

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
T const *p;                     // p is a pointer to a const T
T *const p;                     // p is a const pointer to T
T const *const p;               // p is a const pointer to a const T
&lt;/source&gt;                 
                                           
If the pointer is a local, having a &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; pointer is useless.
The order of T and const can be reversed:     

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const T *p;
&lt;/source&gt;

is the same as

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
T const *p;
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|&lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; can be used in the declaration of variables (arguments, return values and methods) - some of which we will mention later on.

Using &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; has several advantages: 

To users of the &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt;, it is immediately obvious that the &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; methods will not modify the object. 
*Many accidental modifications of objects will be caught at compile time. 
*Compilers like &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; since it allows them to do better optimization.
}}

===== volatile =====
A hint to the compiler that a variable's value can be changed externally; therefore the compiler must avoid aggressive optimization on any code that uses the variable.

Unlike in Java, C++'s &lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt; specifier does not have any meaning in relation to multi-threading. Standard C++ does not include support for multi-threading (though it is a common extension) and so variables needing to be synchronized between threads need a synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes to be employed, keep in mind that &lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt; implies only safety in the presence of implicit or unpredictable actions by the same thread (or by a signal handler in the case of a '''volatile sigatomic_t''' object). Accesses to  &lt;tt&gt;mutable volatile&lt;/tt&gt; variables and fields are viewed as synchronization operations by most compilers and can affect control flow and thus determine whether or not other shared variables are accessed, this implies that in general ordinary memory operations cannot be reordered with respect to a mutable volatile access. This also means that mutable volatile accesses are sequentially consistent. This is not (as yet) part of the standard, it is under discussion and should be avoided until it gets defined.

===== mutable =====
This specifier may only be applied to a non-static, non-const member variables.  It allows the variable to be modified within '''const''' member functions.

'''mutable''' is usually used when an object might be &lt;em&gt;logically constant&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., no outside observable behavior changes, but not &lt;em&gt;bitwise&lt;/em&gt; '''const''', i.e. some internal member might change state.

The canonical example is the proxy pattern. Suppose you have created an image catalog application that shows all images in a long, scrolling list. This list could be modeled as:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class image {
 public:
   // construct an image by loading from disk
   image(const char* const filename); 

   // get the image data
   char const * data() const;
 private:
   // The image data
   char* m_data;
}
 
class scrolling_images {
   image const* images[1000];
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that for the image class, bitwise '''const''' and logically '''const''' is the same: If m_data changes, the public function data() returns different output.

At a given time, most of those images will not be shown, and might never be needed. To avoid having the user wait for a lot of data being loaded which might never be needed, the proxy pattern might be invoked:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class image_proxy {
  public:
   image_proxy( char const * const filename )
      : m_filename( filename ),
        m_image( 0 ) 
   {}
   ~image_proxy() { delete m_image; }
   char const * data() const {
      if ( !m_image ) {
         m_image = new image( m_filename );
      }
      return m_image-&gt;data();
   }
  private:
   char const* m_filename;
   mutable image* m_image;
};
 
class scrolling_images {
   image_proxy const* images[1000];
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the image_proxy does not change observable state when &lt;tt&gt;data()&lt;/tt&gt; is invoked: it is logically constant. However, it is not bitwise constant since &lt;tt&gt;m_image&lt;/tt&gt; changes the first time &lt;tt&gt;data()&lt;/tt&gt; is invoked. This is made possible by declaring &lt;tt&gt;m_image&lt;/tt&gt; mutable. If it had not been declared mutable, the &lt;tt&gt;image_proxy::data()&lt;/tt&gt; would not compile, since &lt;tt&gt;m_image&lt;/tt&gt; is assigned to within a constant function.

{{NOTE|Like exceptions to most rules, the &lt;tt&gt;mutable&lt;/tt&gt; keyword exists for a reason, but should not be overused. If you find that you have marked a significant number of the member variables in your class as &lt;tt&gt;mutable&lt;/tt&gt; you should probably consider whether or not the design really makes sense.}}

===== short =====
The &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; specifier can be applied to the &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; data type.  It can decrease the number of bytes used by the variable, which decreases the range of numbers that the variable can represent.  Typically, a &lt;tt&gt;short int&lt;/tt&gt; is half the size of a regular &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; -- but this will be different depending on the compiler and the system that you use.  When you use the &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; specifier, the &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; type is implicit.  For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
short a;
&lt;/source&gt;

is equivalent to:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
short int a;
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|Although &lt;tt&gt;short&lt;/tt&gt; variables may take up less memory, they can be slower than regular &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; types on some systems.  Because most machines have plenty of memory today, it is rare that using a &lt;tt&gt;short int&lt;/tt&gt; is advantageous.}}

===== long =====
The &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; specifier can be applied to the &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; data types.  It can increase the number of bytes used by the variable, which increases the range of numbers that the variable can represent.  A &lt;tt&gt;long int&lt;/tt&gt; is typically twice the size of an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, and a &lt;tt&gt;long double&lt;/tt&gt; can represent larger numbers more precisely.  When you use &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; by itself, the &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; type is implied.  For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
long a;
&lt;/source&gt;

is equivalent to:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
long int a;
&lt;/source&gt;

The shorter form, with the &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; implied rather than stated, is more idiomatic (i.e., seems more natural to experienced C++ programmers).

Use the &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; specifier when you need to store larger numbers in your variables.  Be aware, however, that on some compilers and systems the long specifier may not increase the size of a variable.  Indeed, most common 32-bit platforms (and one 64-bit platform) use 32 bits for &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; and also 32 bits for &lt;tt&gt;long int&lt;/tt&gt;.

{{NOTE|C++ does not yet allow &lt;tt&gt;long long int&lt;/tt&gt; like modern C does, though it is likely to be added in a future C++ revision, and then would be guaranteed to be at least a 64-bit type.  Most C++ implementations today offer &lt;tt&gt;long long&lt;/tt&gt; or an equivalent as an ''extension'' to standard C++.}}

===== {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} =====
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/unsigned}}

===== signed =====
The &lt;tt&gt;signed&lt;/tt&gt; specifier makes a variable represent both positive and negative numbers.  It can be applied only to the &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt; data types.  The &lt;tt&gt;signed&lt;/tt&gt; specifier is applied by default for &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;long&lt;/tt&gt;, so you typically will never use it in your code.

{{NOTE|Plain &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; is a distinct type from both &lt;tt&gt;signed char&lt;/tt&gt; and {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; although it has the same range and representation as one or the other.  On some platforms plain &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; can hold negative values, on others it cannot.  &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; should be used to represent a character; for a small integral type, use signed char, or for a small type supporting [[w:modular arithmetic|modular arithmetic]] use {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt;.}}

==== Enumerated data type ====
In programming it is often necessary to deal with data types that describe a fixed set of alternatives.  For example, when designing a program to play a card game it is necessary to keep track of the suit of an individual card.

One method for doing this may be to create unique constants to keep track of the suit.  For example one could define
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const int Clubs=0;
const int Diamonds=1;
const int Hearts=2;
const int Spades=3;

int current_card_suit=Diamonds;
&lt;/source&gt;

Unfortunately there are several problems with this method.  The most minor problem is that this can be a bit cumbersome to write.  A more serious problem is that this data is indistinguishable from integers.  It becomes very easy to start using the associated numbers instead of the suits themselves.  Such as:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int current_card_suit=1;
&lt;/source&gt;

...and worse to make mistakes that may be very difficult to catch such as a typo...

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
current_card_suit=11;
&lt;/source&gt;

...which produces a valid expression in C++, but would be meaningless in representing the card's suit.

One way around these difficulty is to create a ''new'' data type specifically designed to keep track of the suit of the card, and ''restricts'' you to only use valid possibilities.  We can accomplish this using an enumerated data type using the C++ {{C++ Programming/kw|enum}} keyword.

==== Type conversion ====
'''Type conversion''' or '''typecasting''' refers to changing an entity of one data type into another.

===== Implicit type conversion =====
'''Implicit type conversion''', also known as '''coercion''', is an automatic and temporary type conversion by the compiler. In a mixed-type expression, data of one or more subtypes can be converted to a supertype as needed at runtime so that the program will run correctly.

For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
double  d;
long    l;
int     i; 
 
if (d &gt; i)      d = i;
if (i &gt; l)      l = i;
if (d == l)     d *= 2;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; belong to different data types, the compiler will then automatically and temporarily converted the original types to equal data types each time a comparison or assignment is executed.

{{NOTE|This behavior should be used with caution, and most modern compiler will provide a warning, as unintended consequences can arise.

Data can be lost when floating-point representations are converted to integral representations as the fractional components of the floating-point values will be truncated (rounded down). Conversely, converting from an integral representation to a floating-point one can also lose precision, since the floating-point type may be unable to represent the integer exactly (for example, float might be an IEEE 754 single precision type, which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly, while a 32-bit integer type can). This can lead to situations such as storing the same integer value into two variables of type int and type single which return false if compared for equality.}}

===== Explicit type conversion =====
'''Explicit type conversion''' manually converts one type into another, and is used in cases where automatic type casting doesn't occur.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
double d = 1.0;

printf (&quot;%d\n&quot;, (int)d);
&lt;/source&gt;

In this example, ''d'' would normally be a double and would be passed to the [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/printf|printf]] function as such. This would result in unexpected behavior, since [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/printf|printf]] would try to look for an int.  The typecast in the example corrects this, and passes the integer to [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Functions/printf|printf]] as expected.

{{NOTE|Explicit type casting should only be used as required.  It should not be used if implicit type conversion would satisfy the requirements.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Type Conversion ==
'''Type conversion''' (often a result of ''type casting'') refers to changing an entity of one '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type/Data Types|data type]]''''', expression, function argument, or return value into another.  This is done to take advantage of certain features of type hierarchies.  For instance, values from a more limited set, such as integers, can be stored in a more compact format and later converted to a different format enabling operations not previously possible, such as division with several decimal places' worth of accuracy.  In the [[w:object-oriented|object-oriented]] programming paradigm, type conversion allows programs also to treat objects of one type as one of another. One must do it carefully as type casting can lead to loss of data.

{{NOTE|The Wikipedia article about [[w:Strongly-typed_programming_language|strongly typed]] suggests that there is not enough consensus on the term &quot;strongly typed&quot; to use it safely. So you should re-check the intended meaning carefully, the above statement is what C++ programmers refer as  ''strongly typed'' in the language scope.}}

=== Automatic type conversion ===
'''Automatic type conversion''' (or standard conversion) happens whenever the compiler expects data of a particular type, but the data is given as a different type, leading to an automatic conversion by the compiler without an explicit indication by the programmer.

{{NOTE|This is not &quot;casting&quot; or explicit type conversions.  There is no such thing as an &quot;automatic cast&quot;.}}

When an expression requires a given type that cannot be obtained through an implicit conversion or if more than one standard conversion creates an ambiguous situation, the programmer must explicitly specify the target type of the conversion. If the conversion is impossible it will result in an error or warning at compile time. Warnings may vary depending on the compiler used or compiler options.

This type of conversion is useful and relied upon to perform integral promotions, integral conversions, floating point conversions, floating-integral conversions, arithmetic conversions, pointer conversions.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int a = 5.6;
float b = 7;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above, in the first case an expression of type float is given and automatically interpreted as an integer. In the second case (more subtle), an integer is given and automatically interpreted as a float.

There are two types of automatic type conversions between numeric types: promotion and conversion. Numeric promotion causes a simple type conversion whenever a value is used, while more complex numeric conversions can take place if the context of the expression requires it.

;Any automatic type conversion is an implicit conversion if not done explicitly in the source code.

Automatic type conversions (implicit conversions) can also occur in the implicit &quot;decay&quot; from an array to a corresponding pointer type based or as a [[C++ Programming/Classes#User defined automatic type conversion|user defined behavior]]. We will cover that after we introduce classes (user defined types) as the automatic type conversions of references (derived class reference to base class reference) and pointer-to-member (from pointing to member of a base class to pointing to member of a derived class).

==== Promotion ====
A numeric promotion is the conversion of a value to a type with a wider range that happens whenever a value of a narrower type is used. Values of integral types narrower than &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;signed char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;short int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unsigned short&lt;/code&gt;) will be promoted to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; if possible, or &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; can't represent all the values of the source type. Values of &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; type will also be converted to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, and in particular &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; will get promoted to 1 and &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; to 0.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// promoting short to int
short left = 12;
short right = 23;

short total = left + right;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the code above, the values of &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt; are both of type &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt; and could be added and assigned as such. However, in C++ they will each be promoted to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; before being added, and the result converted back to &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt; afterwards. The reason for this is that the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; type is designed to be the most natural integer representation on the machine architecture, so requiring that the compiler do its calculations with smaller types may cause an unnecessary performance hit.

Since the C++ standard guarantees only the minimum sizes of the data types, the sizes of the types commonly vary between one architecture and another (and may even vary between one compiler and another). This is the reason why the compiler is allowed the flexibility to promote to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; as necessary.

Promotion works in a similar way on floating-point values: a &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; value will be promoted to a &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; value, leaving the value unchanged.

Since promotion happens in cases where the expression does not require type conversion in order to be compiled, it can cause unexpected effects, for example in overload resolution:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void do_something(short arg)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Doing something with a short&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void do_something(int arg)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Doing something with an int&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    short val = 12;

    do_something(val); // Prints &quot;Doing something with a short&quot;
    do_something(val * val); // Prints &quot;Doing something with an int&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Since &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, you might expect that the expression &lt;code&gt;val * val&lt;/code&gt; would also be a &lt;code&gt;short&lt;/code&gt;, but in fact &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt; is promoted to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, and the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; overload is selected.

==== Numeric conversion ====
After any numeric promotion has been applied, the value can then be converted to another numeric type if required, subject to various constraints.

{{NOTE|The standard guarantees that some conversions are possible without specifying what the exact result will be. This means that certain conversions that are legal can unexpectedly give different results using different compilers.}}

A value of any integer type can be converted to any other integer type, and a value of an enumeration type can be converted to an integer type. This only gets complicated when overflow is possible, as in the case where you convert from a larger type to a smaller type. In the case of conversion to an unsigned type, overflow works in a nice predictable way: the result is the smallest unsigned integer congruent to the value being converted (modulo &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of bits in the destination type).

When converting to a signed integer type where overflow is possible, the result of the conversion depends on the compiler. Most modern compilers will generate a warning if a conversion occurs where overflow could happen. Should the loss of information be intended, the programmer may do explicit type casting to suppress the warning; bit masking may be a superior alternative.

Floating-point types can be converted between each other, but are even more prone to platform-dependence. If the value being converted can be represented exactly in the new type then the exact conversion will happen. Otherwise, if there are two values possible in the destination type and the source value lies between them, then one of the two values will be chosen. In all other cases the result is implementation-defined.

Floating-point types can be converted to integer types, with the fractional part being discarded.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
double a = 12.5;
int b = a;

cout &lt;&lt; b; // Prints &quot;12&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|If a floating-point value is converted to an integer and the result can't be expressed in the destination type, behavior is undefined by the C++ standard, meaning that your program may crash.}}

A value of an integer type can be converted to a floating point type. The result is exact if possible, otherwise it is the next lowest or next highest representable value (depending on the compiler).

=== Explicit type conversion (casting) ===
'''Explicit type conversion''' (casting) is the use of direct and specific notation in the source code to request a conversion or to specify a member from an overloaded class. There are cases where no automatic type conversion can occur or where the compiler is unsure about what type to convert to, those cases require explicit instructions from the programmer or will result in error.

==== Specific type casts ====
A set of casting operators have been introduced into the C++ language to address the shortcomings of the old C-style casts, maintained for compatibility purposes. Bringing with them a clearer syntax, improved semantics and type-safe conversions.

All of the casting operators share a similar syntax and as we will see are used in a manner similar to [[C++ Programming/Templates|templates]], with these new keywords casting becomes easier to understand, find, and maintain.

;The basic form of type cast
The basic explicit form of typecasting is the static cast. 

A static cast looks like this:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
static_cast&lt;target type&gt;(expression)
&lt;/source&gt;

The compiler will try its best to interpret the ''expression'' as if it would be of type ''type''. This type of cast will not produce a warning, even if the type is demoted.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int a = static_cast&lt;int&gt;(7.5);
&lt;/source&gt;

The cast can be used to suppress the warning as shown above.  {{C++ Programming/kw|static_cast}} cannot do all conversions; for example, it cannot remove const qualifiers, and it cannot perform &quot;cross-casts&quot; within a class hierarchy.  It can be used to perform most numeric conversions, including conversion from a integral value to an enumerated type.

{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/static cast}}

{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/const cast}}

===== {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}} =====
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/dynamic cast}}

===== {{C++ Programming/kw|reinterpret_cast}} =====
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/reinterpret cast}}

==== Old C-style casts ====
Other common type casts exist, they are of the form &lt;tt&gt;type(expression)&lt;/tt&gt; (a functional, or function-style, cast) or &lt;tt&gt;(type)expression&lt;/tt&gt; (often known simply as a C-style cast). The format of &lt;tt&gt;(type)expression&lt;/tt&gt; is more common in C (where it is the only cast notation). It has the basic form:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int i = 10;
long l;
 
l = (long)i; //C programming style cast
l = long(i); //C programming style cast in functional form (preferred by some C++ programmers) 
             //note: initializes a new long to i, this is not an explicit cast as in the example above
             //however an implicit cast does occur. i = long((long)i);
&lt;/source&gt;

A C-style cast can, in a single line of source code, make two conversions. For instance remove a variable consteness and alter its type. In C++, the old C-style casts are retained for backwards compatibility.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const char string[]=&quot;1234&quot;;
function( (unsigned char*) string ); //remove const, add unsigned
&lt;/source&gt;

There are several shortcomings in the old C-style casts:
#They allows casting practically any type to any other type, leading to lots of unnecessary trouble - even to creating source code that will compile but not to the intended result. 
#The syntax is the same for every casting operation, making it impossible for the compiler and users to tell the intended purpose of the cast.
#Hard to identify in the source code.

The C++ specific cast keyword are more controlled. Some will make the code safer since they will enable to catch more errors at compile-time, and all are easier to search, identify and maintain in the source code. Performance-wise they are the same with the exception of {{C++ Programming/kw|dynamic_cast}}, for which there is no C equivalent. This makes them generally preferred.

== Operator overloading ==
'''Operator overloading''' (less commonly known as [[w:ad-hoc|ad-hoc]] [[w:type polymorphism|polymorphism]]) is a specific case of [[w:polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] (part of the OO nature of the language) in which some or all operators like &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; are treated as polymorphic functions and as such have different behaviors depending on the types of its arguments.
Operator overloading is usually only [[w:syntactic sugar|syntactic sugar]]. It can easily be emulated using function calls.

Consider this operation:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
add (a, multiply (b,c))
&lt;/source&gt;


Using operator overloading permits a more concise way of writing it, like this:
 a + b * c

(Assuming the &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; operator has higher [[w:precedence|precedence]] than &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;.)

Operator overloading can provide more than an aesthetic benefit, since the language allows operators to be invoked implicitly in some circumstances. Problems, and critics, to the use of operator overloading arise because it allows programmers to give operators completely free functionality, without an imposition of coherency that permits to consistently satisfy user/reader expectations. Usage of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; operator is an example of this problem.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// The expression
a &lt;&lt; 1;
&lt;/source&gt;

Will return twice the value of &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; if &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; is an integer variable, but if &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; is an output stream instead this will write &quot;1&quot; to it. Because operator overloading allows the programmer to change the usual semantics of an operator, it is usually considered good practice to use operator overloading with care.

To overload an operator is to provide it with a new meaning for user-defined types. This is done in the same fashion as defining a function. The basic syntax follows (where @ represents a valid operator):

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
return_type operator@(argument_list)
{
    // ... definition
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Not all operators may be overloaded, new operators cannot be created, and the precedence, associativity or arity of operators cannot be changed (for example ! cannot be overloaded as a binary operator). Most operators may be overloaded as either a member function or non-member function, some, however, must be defined as member functions. Operators should only be overloaded where their use would be natural and unambiguous, and they should perform as expected. For example, overloading + to add two complex numbers is a good use, whereas overloading * to push an object onto a vector would not be considered good style.

{{NOTE|Operator overloading should only be utilized when the meaning of the overloaded operator's operation is unambiguous and practical for the underlying type and where it would offer a significant notational brevity over appropriately named function calls.}}

; A simple Message Header
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// sample of Operator Overloading

#include &lt;string&gt;

class PlMessageHeader
{
    std::string m_ThreadSender;
    std::string m_ThreadReceiver;

    //return true if the messages are equal, false otherwise
    inline bool operator == (const PlMessageHeader &amp;b) const
    {
        return ( (b.m_ThreadSender==m_ThreadSender) &amp;&amp;
                (b.m_ThreadReceiver==m_ThreadReceiver) );
    }

    //return true if the message is for name
    inline bool isFor (const std::string &amp;name) const
    {
        return (m_ThreadReceiver==name);
    }

    //return true if the message is for name
    inline bool isFor (const char *name) const
    {
        return (m_ThreadReceiver==name);// since name type is std::string, it becomes unsafe if name == NULL
    }
};
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|note=
    The use of the &lt;tt&gt;inline&lt;/tt&gt; keyword in the example above is technically redundant, as functions defined within a class definition like this are implicitly inline.}}

=== Operators as member functions ===
Aside from the operators which must be members, operators may be overloaded as member or non-member functions. The choice of whether or not to overload as a member is up to the programmer. Operators are generally overloaded as members when they:

# change the left-hand operand, or
# require direct access to the non-public parts of an object.

When an operator is defined as a member, the number of explicit parameters is reduced by one, as the calling object is implicitly supplied as an operand. Thus, binary operators take one explicit parameter and unary operators none. In the case of binary operators, the left hand operand is the calling object, and no type [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables#Implicit type conversion|coercion]] will be done upon it. This is in contrast to non-member operators, where the left hand operand may be coerced.
    &lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    // binary operator as member function
    Vector2D Vector2D::operator+(const Vector2D&amp; right)const {...}

    // binary operator as non-member function
    Vector2D operator+(const Vector2D&amp; left, const Vector2D&amp; right) {...}

    // binary operator as non-member function with 2 arguments 
    friend Vector2D operator+(const Vector2D&amp; left, const Vector2D&amp; right) {...}

    // unary operator as member function
    Vector2D Vector2D::operator-()const {...}

    // unary operator as non-member function
    Vector2D operator-(const Vector2D&amp; vec) {...}
    &lt;/source&gt;

=== Overloadable operators ===

===== Arithmetic operators =====
*'''+''' (addition)
*'''-''' (subtraction)
*'''*''' (multiplication)
*'''/''' (division)
*'''%''' (modulus)

As binary operators, these involve two arguments which do not have to be the same type. These operators may be defined as member or non-member functions. An example illustrating overloading for the addition of a 2D mathematical vector type follows.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Vector2D Vector2D::operator+(const Vector2D&amp; right)
{
    Vector2D result;
    result.set_x(x() + right.x());
    result.set_y(y() + right.y());
    return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
It is good style to only overload these operators to perform their customary arithmetic operation.
Because operator has been overloaded as member function, it can access private fields.

===== Bitwise operators =====
*'''^''' (XOR)
*'''|''' (OR)
*'''&amp;''' (AND)
*'''~''' (complement)
*'''&lt;&lt;''' (shift left, insertion to stream)
*'''&gt;&gt;''' (shift right, extraction from stream)

All of the bitwise operators are binary, except complement, which is unary. It should be noted that these operators have a lower precedence than the arithmetic operators, so if ^ were to be overloaded for exponentiation, x ^ y + z may not work as intended. Of special mention are the shift operators, &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;. These have been overloaded in the standard library for interaction with streams.  When overloading these operators to work with streams the rules below should be followed:

#overload &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; as friends (so that it can access the private variables with the stream be passed in by references 
#(input/output modifies the stream, and copying is not allowed)
#the operator should return a reference to the stream it receives (to allow chaining, cout &lt;&lt; 3 &lt;&lt; 4 &lt;&lt; 5)

; An example using a 2D vector:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
friend ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; out, const Vector2D&amp; vec) // output
{
    out &lt;&lt; &quot;(&quot; &lt;&lt; vec.x() &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; vec.y() &lt;&lt; &quot;)&quot;;
    return out;
}

friend istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;(istream&amp; in, Vector2D&amp; vec) // input
{
    double x, y;
    // skip opening paranthesis
    in.ignore(1);

    // read x
    in &gt;&gt; x;
    vec.set_x(x);

    // skip delimiter
    in.ignore(2);

    // read y
    in &gt;&gt; y;
    vec.set_y(y);

    // skip closing paranthesis
    in.ignore(1);

    return in;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

===== Assignment operator =====
The assignment operator, '''=''', '''must be a member function''', and is given default behavior for user-defined classes by the compiler, performing an assignment of every member using its assignment operator. This behavior is generally acceptable for simple classes which only contain variables. However, where a class contains references or pointers to outside resources, the assignment operator should be overloaded (as general rule, whenever a destructor and copy constructor are needed so is the assignment operator), otherwise, for example, two strings would share the same buffer and changing one would change the other.

In this case, an assignment operator should perform two duties:

# clean up the old contents of the object
# copy the resources of the other object

For classes which contain raw pointers, before doing the assignment, the assignment operator should check for self-assignment, which generally will not work (as when  the old contents of the object are erased, they cannot be copied to refill the object). Self assignment is generally a sign of a coding error, and thus for classes without raw pointers, this check is often omitted, as while the action is wasteful of cpu cycles, it has no other effect on the code.

; Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class BuggyRawPointer { // example of super-common mistake
    T *m_ptr;
    public:
    BuggyRawPointer(T *ptr) : m_ptr(ptr) {}
    BuggyRawPointer&amp; operator=(BuggyRawPointer const &amp;rhs) {
        delete m_ptr; // free resource; // Problem here!
        m_ptr = 0;
        m_ptr = rhs.m_ptr;
        return *this;
    };
};

BuggyRawPointer x(new T);
x = x; // We might expect this to keep x the same. This sets x.m_ptr == 0. Oops!

// The above problem can be fixed like so:
class WithRawPointer2 {
    T *m_ptr;
    public:
    WithRawPointer2(T *ptr) : m_ptr(ptr) {}
    WithRawPointer2&amp; operator=(WithRawPointer2 const &amp;rhs) {
        if (this != &amp;rhs) {
            delete m_ptr; // free resource;
            m_ptr = 0;
            m_ptr = rhs.m_ptr;
        }
        return *this;
    };
};

WithRawPointer2 x2(new T);
x2 = x2; // x2.m_ptr unchanged.
&lt;/source&gt;

Another common use of overloading the assignment operator is to declare the overload in the private part of the class and not define it. Thus any code which attempts to do an assignment will fail on two accounts, first by referencing a private member function and second fail to link by not having a valid definition. This is done for classes where copying is to be prevented, and generally done with the addition of a privately declared copy constructor

; Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class DoNotCopyOrAssign {
    public:
        DoNotCopyOrAssign() {};
    private:
        DoNotCopyOrAssign(DoNotCopyOrAssign const&amp;);
        DoNotCopyOrAssign &amp;operator=(DoNotCopyOrAssign const &amp;);
};

class MyClass : public DoNotCopyOrAssign {
    public:
        MyClass();
};

MyClass x, y;
x = y; // Fails to compile due to private assignment operator;
MyClass z(x); // Fails to compile due to private copy constructor.
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Relational operators =====
*'''==''' (equality)
*'''!=''' (inequality)
*'''&gt;''' (greater-than)
*'''&lt;''' (less-than)
*'''&gt;=''' (greater-than-or-equal-to)
*'''&lt;=''' (less-than-or-equal-to)

All relational operators are binary, and should return either true or false. Generally, all six operators can be based off a comparison function, or each other, although this is never done automatically (e.g. overloading &gt; will not automatically overload &lt; to give the opposite). There are, however, some templates defined in the header &lt;utility&gt;; if this header is included, then it suffices to just overload operator== and operator&lt;, and the other operators will be provided by the STL.

===== Logical operators =====
*'''!''' (NOT)
*'''&amp;&amp;''' (AND)
*'''||''' (OR) 

The logical operators AND are used when evaluating two expressions to obtain a single relational result.The operator corresponds to the boolean logical opration AND,which yields true if operands are true,and false otherwise.The following panel shows the result of operator evaluting the expression. 

The ! operator is unary, &amp;&amp; and || are binary. It should be noted that in normal use, &amp;&amp; and || have &quot;short-circuit&quot; behavior, where the right operand may not be evaluated, depending on the left operand. When overloaded, these operators get function call precedence, and this short circuit behavior is lost. It is best to leave these operators alone.

; Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
bool Function1();
bool Function2();

Function1() &amp;&amp; Function2();
&lt;/source&gt;
If the result of Function1() is false, then Function2() is not called.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
MyBool Function3();
MyBool Function4();

bool operator&amp;&amp;(MyBool const &amp;, MyBool const &amp;);

Function3() &amp;&amp; Function4()
&lt;/source&gt;
Both Function3() and Function4() will be called no matter what the result of the call is to Function3()
This is a waste of CPU processing, and worse, it could have surprising unintended consequences compared to the expected &quot;short-circuit&quot; behavior of the default operators.  Consider:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
extern MyObject * ObjectPointer;
bool Function1() { return ObjectPointer != null; }
bool Function2() { return ObjectPointer-&gt;MyMethod(); }
MyBool Function3() { return ObjectPointer != null; }
MyBool Function4() { return ObjectPointer-&gt;MyMethod(); }

bool operator&amp;&amp;(MyBool const &amp;, MyBool const &amp;);

Function1() &amp;&amp; Function2(); // Does not execute Function2() when pointer is null
Function3() &amp;&amp; Function4(); // Executes Function4() when pointer is null
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Compound assignment operators =====
*'''+=''' (addition-assignment)
*'''-=''' (subtraction-assignment)
*'''*=''' (multiplication-assignment)
*'''/=''' (division-assignment)
*'''%=''' (modulus-assignment)
*'''&amp;=''' (AND-assignment)
*'''|=''' (OR-assignment)
*'''^=''' (XOR-assignment)
*'''&lt;&lt;=''' (shift-left-assignment)
*'''&gt;&gt;=''' (shift-right-assignment)


Compound assignment operators should be overloaded as member functions, as they change the left-hand operand. Like all other operators (except basic assignment), compound assignment operators must be explicitly defined, they will not be automatically (e.g. overloading = and + will not automatically overload +=). A compound assignment operator should work as expected: A @= B should be equivalent to A = A @ B. An example of += for a two-dimensional mathematical vector type follows.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
Vector2D&amp; Vector2D::operator+=(const Vector2D&amp; right)
{
    this-&gt;x += right.x;
    this-&gt;y += right.y;
    return *this;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Increment and decrement operators =====
*'''++''' (increment)
*'''--''' (decrement)

Increment and decrement have two forms, prefix (++i) and postfix (i++). To differentiate, the postfix version takes a dummy integer. Increment and decrement operators are most often member functions, as they generally need access to the private member data in the class. The prefix version in general should return a reference to the changed object. The postfix version should just return a copy of the original value. In a perfect world, A += 1, A = A + 1, A++, ++A should all leave A with the same value.

; Example:
    &lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
SomeValue&amp; SomeValue::operator++() // prefix
{
    ++data;
    return *this;
}

SomeValue SomeValue::operator++(int unused) // postfix
{
    SomeValue result = *this;
    ++data;
    return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Often one operator is defined in terms of the other for ease in maintenance, especially if the function call is complex.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
SomeValue SomeValue::operator++(int unused) // postfix
{
    SomeValue result = *this;
    ++(*this); // call SomeValue::operator++()
    return result;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
===== Subscript operator =====
The subscript operator, '''[ ]''', is a binary operator which '''must be a member function''' (hence it takes only one explicit parameter, the index). The subscript operator is not limited to taking an integral index. For instance, the index for the subscript operator for the std::map template is the same as the type of the key, so it may be a string etc. The subscript operator is generally overloaded twice; as a non-constant function (for when elements are altered), and as a constant function (for when elements are only accessed).

===== Function call operator =====
The function call operator, '''( )''', is generally overloaded to create objects which behave like functions, or for classes that have a primary operation. The function call operator must be a member function, but has no other restrictions - it may be overloaded with any number of parameters of any type, and may return any type. A class may also have several definitions for the function call operator.

===== Address of, Reference, and Pointer operators =====
These three operators, operator&amp;(), operator*() and operator-&gt;() can be overloaded. In general these operators are only overloaded for smart pointers, or classes which attempt to mimic the behavior of a raw pointer. The pointer operator, operator-&gt;() has the additional requirement that the result of the call to that operator, must return a pointer, or a class with an overloaded operator-&gt;(). In general A == *&amp;A should be true.

Note that overloading operator&amp; invokes undefined behavior:
:ISO/IEC 14882:2003, Section 5.3.1
:The address of an object of incomplete type can be taken, but if the complete type of that object is a class type that declares operator&amp;() as a member function, then the behavior is undefined (and no diagnostic is required).

; Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class T {
    public:
        const memberFunction() const;
};

// forward declaration
class DullSmartReference;

class DullSmartPointer {
    private:
        T *m_ptr;
    public:
        DullSmartPointer(T *rhs) : m_ptr(rhs) {};
        DullSmartReference operator*() const {
            return DullSmartReference(*m_ptr);
        }
        T *operator-&gt;() const {
            return m_ptr;
        }
};

class DullSmartReference {
    private:
        T *m_ptr;
    public:
        DullSmartReference (T &amp;rhs) : m_ptr(&amp;rhs) {}
        DullSmartPointer operator&amp;() const {
            return DullSmartPointer(m_ptr);
        }
        // conversion operator
        operator T() { return *m_ptr; }
};

DullSmartPointer dsp(new T);
dsp-&gt;memberFunction(); // calls T::memberFunction

T t;
DullSmartReference dsr(t);
dsp = &amp;dsr;
t = dsr; // calls the conversion operator
&lt;/source&gt;
These are extremely simplified examples designed to show how the operators can be overloaded and not the full details of a SmartPointer or SmartReference class. In general you won't want to overload all three of these operators in the same class.

===== Comma operator =====
The comma operator,() ''',''' can be overloaded. The language comma operator has left to right precedence, the operator,() has function call precedence, so be aware that overloading the comma operator has many pitfalls.

; Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
MyClass operator,(MyClass const &amp;, MyClass const &amp;);

MyClass Function1();
MyClass Function2();

MyClass x = Function1(), Function2();
&lt;/source&gt;
For non overloaded comma operator, the order of execution will be Function1(), Function2(); With the overloaded comma operator, the compiler can call either Function1(), or Function2() first.

===== Member Reference operators =====
The two member access operators, operator-&gt;() and operator-&gt;*() can be overloaded. The most common use of overloading these operators is with defining expression template classes, which is not a common programming technique. Clearly by overloading these operators you can create some very unmaintainable code so overload these operators only with great care.

When the -&gt; operator is applied to a pointer value of type (T *), the language dereferences the pointer and applies the . member access operator (so x-&gt;m is equivalent to (*x).m).  However, when the -&gt; operator is applied to a class instance, it is called as a unary postfix operator; it is expected to return a value to which the -&gt; operator can again be applied.  Typically, this will be a value of type (T *), as in the example under [[#Address of.2C Reference.2C and Pointer operators|Address of, Reference, and Pointer operators]] above, but can also be a class instance with operator-&gt;() defined; the language will call operator-&gt;() as many times as necessary until it arrives at a value of type (T *).

===== Memory management operators =====
* '''new''' (allocate memory for object)
* '''new[ ]''' (allocate memory for array)
* '''delete''' (deallocate memory for object)
* '''delete[ ]''' (deallocate memory for array)

The memory management operators can be overloaded to customize allocation and deallocation (e.g. to insert pertinent memory headers). They should behave as expected, '''new''' should return a pointer to a newly allocated object on the heap, '''delete''' should deallocate memory, ignoring a NULL argument. To overload '''new''', several rules must be followed:

* '''new''' must be a member function 
* the return type must be ''void*''
* the first explicit parameter must be a ''size_t'' value

To overload '''delete''' there are also conditions:

* '''delete''' must be a member function (and cannot be virtual)
* the return type must be ''void''
* there are only two forms available for the parameter list, and only one of the forms may appear in a class:
** ''void*''
** ''void*, size_t''

===== Conversion operators =====
Conversion operators enable objects of a class to be either implicitly (coercion) or explicitly (casting) converted to another type. Conversion operators must be member functions, and should not change the object which is being converted, so should be flagged as constant functions. The basic syntax of a conversion operator declaration, and declaration for an int-conversion operator follows.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
operator ''type''() const; // const is not necessary, but is good style
operator int() const;
&lt;/source&gt;
Notice that the function is declared without a return-type, which can easily be inferred from the type of conversion. Including the return type in the function header for a conversion operator is a syntax error.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
double operator double() const; // error - return type included
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Operators which cannot be overloaded ===
*'''?:''' (conditional)
*'''.''' (member selection)
*'''.*''' (member selection with pointer-to-member)
*'''::''' (scope resolution)
*{{C++ Programming/kw|sizeof}} (object size information)
*'''typeid''' (object type information)

To understand the reasons why the language doesn't permit these operators to be overloaded, read &quot;Why can't I overload dot, ::, {{C++ Programming/kw|sizeof}}, etc.?&quot; at the Bjarne Stroustrup's C++ Style and Technique FAQ ( http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq2.html#overload-dot ).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== The string class ===
The string class is a part of the C++ standard library, used for convenient manipulation of sequences of characters, to replace the static, unsafe C method of handling strings. To use the string class in a program, the &lt;string&gt; header must be included. The standard library string class can be accessed through the '''''std namespace'''''.

The basic template class is &lt;code&gt;basic_string&lt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and its standard specializations are &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wstring&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Basic usage ====
Declaring a ''std'' string is done by using one of these two methods:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
using namespace std;
string std_string;

or
 
std::string std_string;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Text I/O ====
This section will deal only with keyboard and text input. There are many other inputs that can be read (mouse movements and button clicks, etc...), but these will not be covered in this section, even reading the special keys of the keyboard will be excluded.  

Perhaps the most basic use of the string class is for reading text from the user and writing it to the screen. In the header file &lt;tt&gt;iostream&lt;/tt&gt;, C++ defines an object named cin that handles input in much the same way that cout handles output.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// snipped designed to get an integer value from the user
int x; 
std::cin &gt;&gt; x; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The &gt;&gt; operator will cause the execution to stop and will wait for the user to type something. If the user types a valid integer, it will be converted into an integer value and stored in x.

If the user types something other than an integer, the compiler will not report an error. Instead, it leaves the old content (a &quot;random&quot; meaningless value) in &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and continues. 

This can then be extended into the following program:
{{:C++ Programming/Code/IO/Streams/string/Examples/Accepting and printing a String}}

Although a string may hold a sequence containing any character--including spaces and nulls--when reading into a string using cin and the extraction operator (&gt;&gt;) only the characters before the first space will be stored. Alternatively, if an entire line of text is desired, the ''getline'' function may be used:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
    std::getline(std::cin, name);
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Getting user input =====
Fortunately, there is a way to check and see if an input statement succeeds. We can invoke the good function on cin to check what is called the stream state. good returns a bool: if true, then the last input statement succeeded. If not, we know that some previous operation failed, and also that the next operation will fail.

Thus, getting input from the user might look like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main () 
{ 
  using namespace std; // pull in the std namespace
  int x; 
 
  // prompt the user for input 
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter an integer: &quot;; 
 
  // get input 
  cin &gt;&gt; x; 
 
  // check and see if the input statement succeeded 
  if (cin.good() == false) { 
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;That was not an integer.&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; 
    return -1; 
  } 
 
  // print the value we got from the user 
  cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl; 
  return 0; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

cin can also be used to input a string:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string name; 

cout &lt;&lt; &quot;What is your name? &quot;; 
cin &gt;&gt; name; 
cout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; endl; 
&lt;/source&gt;

As with the scanf() function from the Standard C Library, this statement only takes the first word of input, and leaves the rest for the next input statement. So, if you run this program and type your full name, it will only output your first name.

You may also notice the &gt;&gt; operator doesn't handle errors as expected (for example, if you accidentally typed your name in a prompt for a number.)  Because of these issues, it may be more suitable to read a line of text, and using the line for input — this is performed using the function called getline.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string name; 

cout &lt;&lt; &quot;What is your name? &quot;; 
getline (cin, name); 
cout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; endl; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The first argument to getline is cin, which is where the input is coming from. The second argument is the name of the string variable where you want the result to be stored.

getline reads the entire line until the user hits Return or Enter. This is useful for inputting strings that contain spaces.

In fact, getline is generally useful for getting input of any kind. For example, if you wanted the user to type an integer, you could input a string and then check to see if it is a valid integer. If so, you can convert it to an integer value. If not, you can print an error message and ask the user to try again.

To convert a string to an integer you can use the strtol function defined in the header file cstdlib.  (Note that the older function atoi is less safe than strtol, as well as being less capable.)

If you still need the features of the &gt;&gt; operator, you will need to create a string stream as available from &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;sstream&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.  The use of this stream will be discussed in a later chapter.

{{BookCat}}

==== More advanced string manipulation ====
{{TODO|Detail the commonly used std::string member functions(partially done)|C++ Programming}}

We will be using this dummy string for some of our examples.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string str(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

This invokes the default constructor with a &lt;code&gt;const char*&lt;/code&gt; argument. Default constructor creates a string which contains nothing, i.e. no characters, not even a &lt;code&gt;'\0'&lt;/code&gt; (however std::string is not null terminated).

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string str2(str);
&lt;/source&gt;

Will trigger the copy constructor. &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; knows enough to make a deep copy of the characters it 
stores.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string str2 = str;
&lt;/source&gt;

This will copy strings using assignment operator. Effect of this code is same as using copy constructor in example above.


===== Size =====
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string::size_type string::size() const;
string::size_type string::length() const;
&lt;/source&gt;

So for example one might do:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string::size_type strSize =  str.size();
string::size_type strSize2 = str2.length();
&lt;/source&gt;

The methods &lt;code&gt;size()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;length()&lt;/code&gt; both return the size of the string object. There is no apparent difference. Remember that the last character in the string is &lt;code&gt;size() - 1&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;size()&lt;/code&gt;. Like in C-style strings, and arrays in general, &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; starts counting from 0.

===== I/O =====
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;out, string &amp;str);
istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;(istream &amp;in, string &amp;str);
&lt;/source&gt;

The shift operators (&lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;) have been overloaded so you can perform I/O operations on &lt;code&gt;istream&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ostream&lt;/code&gt; objects, most notably &lt;code&gt;cout&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cin&lt;/code&gt;, and filestreams. Thus you could just do console I/O like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::cout &lt;&lt; str &lt;&lt; endl;
std::cin &gt;&gt; str;

istream&amp; getline (istream&amp; in, string&amp; str, char delim = '\n');
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively, if you want to read entire lines at a time, use &lt;code&gt;getline()&lt;/code&gt;. Note that this is not a member function. &lt;code&gt;getline()&lt;/code&gt; will retrieve characters from input stream &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; and assign them to &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; until &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; is reached or &lt;code&gt;delim&lt;/code&gt; is encountered. &lt;code&gt;getline&lt;/code&gt; will reset the input string before appending data to it. &lt;code&gt;delim&lt;/code&gt; can be set to any &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; value and acts as a general delimiter. Here is some example usage:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
//open a file
std::ifstream file(&quot;somefile.cpp&quot;);
std::string data, temp;

while( getline(file, temp, '#')) //while data left in file
{
    //append data
    data += temp;
}

std::cout &lt;&lt; data;
&lt;/source&gt;

Because of the way &lt;code&gt;getline&lt;/code&gt; works (i.e. it returns the input stream), you can nest multiple &lt;code&gt;getline()&lt;/code&gt; calls to get multiple strings; however this may significantly reduce readability.

===== Operators =====
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char&amp; string::operator[](string::size_type pos);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Chars&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;s can be accessed directly using the overloaded subscript (&lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;) operator, like in &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; arrays:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::cout &lt;&lt; str[0] &lt;&lt; str[2];
&lt;/source&gt;

prints &quot;Hl&quot;.

&lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; supports casting from the older C string type &lt;code&gt;const char*&lt;/code&gt;. You can also assign or append a simple &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; to a string. Assigning a &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; is as simple as

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
str = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you want to do it character by character, you can also use

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
str = 'H';
&lt;/source&gt;

Not surprisingly, &lt;code&gt;operator+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;operator+=&lt;/code&gt; are also defined! You can append another &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;const char*&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; to any string.

The comparison operators &lt;code&gt;&gt;, &lt;, ==, &gt;=, &lt;=, !=&lt;/code&gt; all perform comparison operations on strings, similar to the C strcmp() function. These return a true/false value.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if(str == &quot;Hello World!&quot;)
{
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Strings are equal!&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Searching strings =====
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string::size_type string::find(string needle, string::size_type pos = 0) const;
&lt;/source&gt;
You can use the &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt; member function to find the first occurrence of a string inside another. &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt; will look for &lt;code&gt;needle&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; starting from position &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt; and return the position of the first occurrence of the &lt;code&gt;needle&lt;/code&gt;. For example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::string haystack = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
std::string needle = &quot;o&quot;;
std::cout &lt;&lt; haystack.find(needle);
&lt;/source&gt;

Will simply print &quot;4&quot; which is the index of the first occurrence of &quot;o&quot; in &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;. If we want the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;World&quot;, we need to modify &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt; to point past the first occurrence. &lt;code&gt;str.find(find, 4)&lt;/code&gt; would return 4, while &lt;code&gt;str.find(find, 5)&lt;/code&gt; would give 7. If the substring isn't found, &lt;code&gt;find()&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;std::string::npos&lt;/code&gt;.This simple code searches a string for all occurrences of &quot;wiki&quot; and prints their positions:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::string wikistr = &quot;wikipedia is full of wikis (wiki-wiki means fast)&quot;;
for(string::size_type i = 0, tfind; (tfind = wikistr.find(&quot;wiki&quot;, i)) != string::npos; i = tfind + 1)
{
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Found occurrence of 'wiki' at position &quot; &lt;&lt; tfind &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

string::size_type string::rfind(string needle, string::size_type pos = string::npos) const;
&lt;/source&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;rfind()&lt;/code&gt; works similarly, except it returns the ''last'' occurrence of the passed string.

===== Inserting/erasing =====
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string&amp; string::insert(size_type pos, const string&amp; str);
&lt;/source&gt;
You can use the &lt;code&gt;insert()&lt;/code&gt; member function to insert another string into a string.
For example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string newstr = &quot; Human&quot;;
str.insert (5,newstr);
&lt;/source&gt;

Would return ''Hello Human World!''

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string&amp; string::erase(size_type pos, size_type n);
&lt;/source&gt;
You can use &lt;code&gt;erase()&lt;/code&gt; to remove a substring from a string. For example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
str.erase (6,11);
&lt;/source&gt;
Would return ''Hello!''

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string&amp; string::substr(size_type pos, size_type n);
&lt;/source&gt;
You can use &lt;code&gt;substr()&lt;/code&gt; to extract a substring from a string. For example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
string str = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
string part = str.substr(6,5);
&lt;/source&gt;
Would return ''World''.

===== Backwards compatibility =====
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const char* string::c_str() const;
const char* string::data() const;
&lt;/source&gt;
For backwards compatibility with C/C++ functions which only accept &lt;code&gt;char*&lt;/code&gt; parameters, you can use the member functions &lt;code&gt;string::c_str()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;string::data()&lt;/code&gt; to return a temporary &lt;code&gt;const char*&lt;/code&gt; string you can pass to a function.  The difference between these two functions is that &lt;code&gt;c_str()&lt;/code&gt; returns a null-terminated string while &lt;code&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; does not necessarily return a null-terminated string.  So, if your legacy function requires a null-terminated string, use &lt;code&gt;c_str()&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise use &lt;code&gt;data()&lt;/code&gt; (and presumably pass the length of the string in as well).

==== String Formatting ====

Strings can only be appended to other strings, but not to numbers or other datatypes, so something like &lt;code&gt;std::string(&quot;Foo&quot;) + 5&lt;/code&gt; would not result in a string with the content &lt;code&gt;&quot;Foo5&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. To convert other datatypes into string there exist the class &lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream&lt;/code&gt;, found in the include file &lt;code&gt;&lt;sstream&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream&lt;/code&gt; acts exactly like &lt;code&gt;std::cout&lt;/code&gt;, the only difference is that the output doesn't go to the current standard output as provided by the operating system, but into an internal buffer, that buffer can be converted into a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; via the &lt;code&gt;std::ostringstream::str()&lt;/code&gt; method.

===== Example =====
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;

int main()
{ 
    std::ostringstream buffer;

    // Use the std::ostringstream just like std::cout or other iostreams
    buffer &lt;&lt; &quot;You have: &quot; &lt;&lt; 5 &lt;&lt; &quot; Helloworlds in your inbox&quot;;
 
    // Convert the std::ostringstream to a normal string
    std::string text = buffer.str();
 
    std::cout &lt;&lt; text &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Variables ==
Much like a person has a name that distinguishes him or her from other people, a ''variable'' assigns a particular instance of an object type, a ''name'' or ''label'' by which the instance can be referred to. The variable is the most important concept in programming, it is how the code can manipulate data. Depending on its use in the code a variable has a specific locality in relation to the hardware and based on the structure of the code it also has a specific scope where the compiler will recognize it as valid. All these characteristics are defined by a programmer.

=== Internal storage ===
We need a way to store data that can be stored, accessed and altered on the hardware by programming. Most computer systems operate using binary logic. The computer represents value using two voltage levels, usually 0V for ''logic 0'' and either +3.3 V or +5V for ''logic 1''. These two voltage levels represent exactly two different values and by convention the values are zero and one. These two values, coincidentally, correspond to the two digits used by the binary number system. Since there is a correspondence between the logic levels used by the computer and the two digits used in the binary numbering system, it should come as no surprise that computers employ the binary system.

;'''The Binary Number System'''

The binary number system uses base 2 which requires therefore only the digits ''0'' and ''1''. 

==== Bits and bytes ====
We typically write binary numbers as a sequence of bits (bits is short for binary digits). It is also a normal convention that these bit sequences, to make binary numbers more easier to read and comprehend, be added spaces in a specific relevant boundary, to be selected from the context that the number is being used. Much like we use a comma (UK and most ex-colonies) or a point to separated every three digits in larger decimal numbers. For example, the binary value 1010111110110010 could be written '''1010 1111 1011 0010'''.

These are defined boundaries for specific bit sequences.

;'''The bit'''
The smallest unit of data on a binary computer is a single bit. Since a single bit is capable of representing only two different values (typically zero or one) you may get the impression that there are a very small number of items you can represent with a single bit. Not true! There are an infinite number of items you can represent with a single bit.

With a single bit, you can represent any two distinct items. Examples include zero or one, true or false, on or off, male or female, and right or wrong. However, by using more than one bit, you will not be limited to representing binary data types (that is, those objects which have only two distinct values).

To confuse things even more, different bits can represent different things. For example, one bit might be used to represent the values zero and one, while an adjacent bit might be used to represent the colors red or black. How can you tell by looking at the bits? The answer, of course, is that you can't. But this illustrates the whole idea behind computer data structures: data is what you define it to be.

If you use a bit to represent a boolean (true/false) value then that bit (by your definition) represents true or false. For the bit to have any true meaning, you must be consistent. That is, if you're using a bit to represent true or false at one point in your program, you shouldn't use the true/false value stored in that bit to represent red or black later.

Since most items you will be trying to model require more than two different values, single bit values aren't the most popular data type. However, since everything else consists of groups of bits, bits will play an important role in your programs. Of course, there are several data types that require two distinct values, so it would seem that bits are important by themselves. however, you will soon see that individual bits are difficult to manipulate, so we'll often use other data types to represent boolean values.

;'''The nibble'''
A nibble is a collection of bits on a 4-bit boundary. It would not be a particularly interesting data structure except for two items: BCD (binary coded decimal) numbers and hexadecimal (base 16) numbers. It takes four bits to represent a single BCD or hexadecimal digit.

With a nibble, we can represent up to 16 distinct values. In the case of hexadecimal numbers, the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F are represented with four bits.

BCD uses ten different digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and requires four bits. In fact, any sixteen distinct values can be represented with a nibble, but hexadecimal and BCD digits are the primary items we can represent with a single nibble.

;'''The byte'''
The byte is the smallest individual piece of data that we can access or modify on a computer, it is without question, the most important data structure used by microprocessors today. Main memory and I/O addresses in the PC are all byte addresses. 

On almost all computer types, a byte consists of eight bits, although computers with larger bytes do exist. A byte is the smallest addressable datum (data item) in the microprocessor, this is why processors only works on bytes or groups of bytes, never on bits. To access anything smaller requires that you read the byte containing the data and mask out the unwanted bits.

Since the computer is a byte addressable machine, it turns out to be more efficient to manipulate a whole byte than an individual bit or nibble. For this reason, most programmers use a whole byte to represent data types that require no more than 256 items, even if fewer than eight bits would suffice. For example, we will often represent the boolean values true and false by 00000001 and 00000000 (respectively).

{{NOTE|This is why the [[C++ Programming/ASCII|ASCII code]], is used in  in most computers, it is based in a 7-bit non-weighted binary code, that takes advantage of the byte boundary.}}

Probably the most important use for a byte is holding a character code. Characters typed at the keyboard, displayed on the screen, and printed on the printer all have numeric values.

[[Image:byte45.png|||left|||A byte contains 8 bits]]
A byte (usually) contains 8 bits.  A bit can only have the value of 0 or 1. If all bits are set to 1, 11111111 in binary equals to 255 decimal.

The bits in a byte are numbered from bit zero (b0) through seven (b7) as follows:
b7	b6	b5	b4	b3	b2	b1	b0

Bit 0 (b0) is the '''low order bit''' or '''least significant bit''' ('''lsb'''), bit 7 is the '''high order bit''' or '''most significant bit''' ('''msb''') of the byte. We'll refer to all other bits by their number.

A byte also contains exactly two ''nibbles''. Bits b0 through b3 comprise the low order nibble, and bits b4 through b7 form the high order nibble.

Since a byte contains eight bits, exactly two nibbles, byte values require two hexadecimal digits. It can represent 2^8, or 256, different values. Generally, we'll use a byte to represent:
#unsigned numeric values in the range 0 =&gt; 255 
#signed numbers in the range -128 =&gt; +127 
#ASCII character codes 
#other special data types requiring no more than 256 different values. Many data types have fewer than 256 items so eight bits is usually sufficient. 

In this representation of a computer byte, a bit number is used to label each bit in the byte.  The bits are labeled from 7 to 0 instead of 0 to 7 or even 1 to 8, because processors always start counting at 0. It is simply more convenient to use 0 for computers as we shall see. The bits are also shown in descending order because, like with decimal numbers (normal base 10), we put the more significant digits to the left. 

Consider the number 254 in decimal. The 2 here is more significant than the other digits because it represents hundreds as opposed to tens for the 5 or singles for the 4. The same is done in binary. The more significant digits are put towards the left. In binary, there are only 2 digits, instead of counting from 0 to 9, we only count from 0 to 1, but counting is done by exactly the same principles as counting in decimal. If we want to count higher than 1, then we need to add a more significant digit to the left. In decimal, when we count beyond 9, we need to add a 1 to the next significant digit. It sometimes may look confusing or different only because humans are used to counting with 10 digits. 

{{NOTE|The most significant digit in a byte is bit#7 and the least significant digit is bit#0. These are otherwise known as &quot;msb&quot; and &quot;lsb&quot; respectively in lowercase.  If written in uppercase, MSB will mean most significant BYTE. You will see these terms often in programming or hardware manuals. Also, lsb is always bit#0, but msb can vary depending on how many bytes we use to represent numbers. However, we won't look into that right now.
}}

In decimal, each digit represents multiple of a power of 10. So, in the decimal number 254.
* The ''4'' represents four multiples of one (&lt;math&gt;4 \times 10^0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;10^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;).
* Since we're working in decimal (base 10), the ''5'' represents five multiples of 10 (&lt;math&gt;5 \times 10^1&lt;/math&gt;)
* Finally the ''2'' represents two multiples of 100 (&lt;math&gt;2 \times 10^2&lt;/math&gt;)

All this is elementary. The key point to recognize is that as we move from right to left in the number, the significance of the digits increases by a multiple of 10. This should be obvious when we look at the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;(2 \times 10^2) + (5 \times 10^1) + (4 \times 10^0) = 254&lt;/math&gt;

In binary, each digit can only be one of two possibilities (0 or 1), therefore when we work with binary we work in base 2 instead of base 10. So, to convert the binary number 1101 to decimal we can use the following base 10 equation, which is very much like the one above:

&lt;math&gt;(1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^2) + (0 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:byte45.png|||left|||A byte contains 8 bits]]
To convert the number we simply add the bit values (&lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;) where a 1 shows up. Let's take a look at our example byte again, and try to find its value in decimal.

First off, we see that bit #5 is a 1, so we have &lt;math&gt;2^5 = 32&lt;/math&gt; in our total. Next we have bit#3, so we add &lt;math&gt;2^3 = 8&lt;/math&gt;. This gives us 40. Then next is bit#2, so 40 + 4 is 44. And finally is bit#0 to give 44 + 1 = 45. So this binary number is 45 in decimal.

As can be seen, it is impossible for different bit combinations to give the same decimal value. Here is a quick example to show the relationship between counting in binary (base 2) and counting in decimal (base 10).

&lt;math&gt;00_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;0_{10}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;01_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;1_{10}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;10_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;2_{10}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;11_2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;3_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

The bases that these numbers are in are shown in subscript to the right of the number.

===== Carry bit =====
[[Image:byte256.png|||left|||]]
As a side note. What would happen if you added 1 to 255? No combination will represent 256 unless we add more bits. The next value (if we could have another digit) would be 256. So our byte would look like this.

But this &lt;math&gt;9^{th}&lt;/math&gt; bit (bit#8) doesn't exist. So where does it go? To be precise it actually goes into the carry bit. The carry bit resides in the processor of the computer, has an internal bit used exclusively for carry operations such as this. So if one adds 1 to 255 stored in a byte, the result would be 0 with the carry bit set in the CPU. Of course, a C++ programmer, never gets to use this bit directly. You'll would need to learn assembly to do that.
{{clear}}

===== Endianness =====
After examining a single byte, it is time to look at ways to represent numbers larger than 255. This is done by grouping bytes together, we can represent numbers that are much larger than 255. If we use 2 bytes together, we double the number of bits in our number. In effect, 16 bits allows the representation numbers up to 65535 ({{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}}), and 32 bits allows the representation of numbers above 4 billion. 

[[Image:PrimitiveTypes.png||right|3 basic primitive types char,short int,long int.]]

Here are a few basic primitive types:

* char (1 byte (by definition), max {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} value: at least 255)

* short int (at least 2 bytes, max {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} value: at least 65535)

* long int (at least 4 bytes, max {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} value: at least 4294967295)

* float (typically 4 bytes, floating point)

* double (typically 8 bytes, floating point)

{{NOTE|When using 'short int' and 'long int', you can leave out the 'int' as the compiler will know what type you want. You can also use 'int' by itself and it will default to whatever your compiler is set at for an int. On most recent compilers, int defaults to a 32-bit type.}}

All the information already given about the byte is valid for the other primitive types. The difference is simply the number of bits used is different and the msb is now bit#15 for a short and bit#31 for a long (assuming a 32-bit long type).

In a short (16-bit), one may think that in memory the byte for bits 15 to 8 would be followed by the byte for bits 7 to 0. In other words, byte #0 would be the high byte and byte #1 would be the low byte. This is true for some other systems. For example, the Motorola 68000 series CPUs do use this byte ordering. However, on PCs (with 8088/286/386/486/Pentiums) this is not so. The ordering is reversed so that the low byte comes before the high byte. The byte that represents bits 0 to 7 always comes before all other bytes on PCs. This is called little-endian ordering. The other ordering, such as on the M68000, is called big-endian ordering. This is very important to remember when doing low level byte operations that aim to be portable across systems.

For big-endian computers, the basic idea is to keep the higher bits on the left or in front.  For little-endian computers, the idea is to keep the low bits in the low byte.  There is no inherent advantage to either scheme except perhaps for an oddity.  Using a little-endian long int as a smaller type of int is theoretically possible as the low byte(s) is/are always in the same location (first byte).  With big-endian the low byte is always located differently depending on the size of the type.  For example (in big-endian), the low byte is the &lt;math&gt;4^{th}&lt;/math&gt; byte in a long int and the &lt;math&gt;2^{nd}&lt;/math&gt; byte in a short int.  So a proper cast must be done and low level tricks become rather dangerous.

To convert from one endianness to the other, one reverses the values of the bytes, putting the highest bytes value in the lowest byte and the lowest bytes value in the highest byte, and swap all the values for the in between bytes, so that if you had a 4 byte little-endian integer 0x0A0B0C0D (the 0x signifies that the value is hexadecimal) then converting it to big-endian would change it to 0x0D0C0B0A.

Bit endianness, where the bit order inside the bytes changes, is rarely used in data storage and only really ever matters in serial communication links, where the hardware deals with it.

There are computers which don't follow a strictly big-endian or little-endian bit layout, but they're rare. An example is the PDP-11's storage of 32-bit values.

===== Understanding two's complement =====
Two's complement is a way to store negative numbers in a pure binary representation. The reason that the two's complement method of storing negative numbers was chosen is because this allows the CPU to use the same add and subtract instructions on both signed and {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} numbers.

To convert a positive number into its negative two's complement format, you begin by flipping all the bits in the number (1's become 0's and 0's become 1's) and then add 1. (This also works to turn a negative number back into a positive number Ex: -34 into 34 or vice-versa).

[[Image:byte45.png|||left|||A byte contains 8 bits]]
Let's try to convert our number 45.
{{clear}}
[[Image:byte45flip.png|||left|||A byte contains 8 bits]]
First, we flip all the bits...
{{clear}}
[[Image:byte45flip1.png|||left|||A byte contains 8 bits]]
And add 1.
{{clear}}
Now if we add up the values for all the one bits, we get... 128+64+16+2+1=211? What happened here? Well, this number actually is 211. It all depends on how you interpret it. If you decide this number is {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}}, then it's value is 211. But if you decide it's signed, then it's value is -45. It is completely up to you how you treat the number.

If and only if you decide to treat it as a signed number, then look at the msb (most significant bit [bit#7]). '''If it's a 1, then it's a negative number.''' If it's a 0, then it's positive. In C++, using {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} in front of a type will tell the compiler you want to use this variable as an {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} number, otherwise it will be treated as signed number.

Now, if you see the msb is set, then you know it's negative. So convert it back to a positive number to find out it's real value using the process just described above.

Let's go through a few examples.

&lt;center&gt;Treat the following number as an {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} byte. What is it's value in decimal?&lt;/center&gt;
[[Image:byte228.png|||center|||A byte contains 8 bits]]

Since this is an {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} number, no special handling is needed. Just add up all the values where there's a 1 bit. 128+64+32+4=228. So this binary number is 228 in decimal.
{{clear}}
&lt;center&gt;Now treat the number above as a signed byte. What is its value in decimal?&lt;/center&gt;

Since this is now a signed number, we first have to check if the msb is set. Let's look. Yup, bit #7 is set. So we have to do a two's complement conversion to get its value as a positive number (then we'll add the negative sign afterwards).

[[Image:byte228flip.png|||left|||A byte contains 8 bits]]
Ok, so let's flip all the bits...
[[Image:byte228flip1.png|||left|||A byte contains 8 bits]]
And add 1. This is a little trickier since a carry propagates to the third bit. For bit#0, we do 1+1 = 10 in binary. So we have a 0 in bit#0. Now we have to add the carry to the second bit (bit#1). 1+1=10. bit#1 is 0 and again we carry a 1 over to the &lt;math&gt;3^{rd}&lt;/math&gt; bit (bit#2). 0+1 = 1 and we're done the conversion.

Now we add the values where there's a one bit. 16+8+4 = 28. Since we did a conversion, we add the negative sign to give a value of -28. So if we treat 11100100 (base 2) as a signed number, it has a value of -28. If we treat it as an {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} number, it has a value of 228.

Let's try one last example.

&lt;center&gt;Give the decimal value of the following binary number both as a signed and {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} number.&lt;/center&gt;
[[Image:byte5.png|||center|||A byte contains 8 bits]]

First as an {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} number. So we add the values where there's a 1 bit set. 4+1 = 5. For an {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} number, it has a value of 5.

Now for a signed number. We check if the msb is set. Nope, bit #7 is 0. So for a signed number, it also has a value of 5.

As you can see, if a signed number doesn't have its msb set, then you treat it exactly like an {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} number.

{{NOTE|note=
A special case of two's complement is where the sign bit (msb or bit#7 in a byte) is set to one and all other bits are zero, then its two's complement will be itself.  It is a fact that two's complement notation (signed numbers) have 1 extra number than can be negative than positive.  So for bytes, you have a range of -128 to +127.  The reason for this is that the number zero uses a bit pattern (all zeros).  Out of all the 256 possibilities, this leaves 255 to be split between positive and negative numbers.  As you can see, this is an odd number and cannot be divided equally.  If you were to try and split them, you would be left with the bit pattern described above where the sign bit is set (to 1) and all other bits are zeros.  Since the sign bit is set, it has to be a negative number.

If you see this bit pattern of a sign bit set with everything else a zero, you cannot convert it to a positive number using two's complement conversion.  The way you find out its value is to figure out the maximum number of bit patterns the value or type can hold.  For a byte, this is 256 possibilities.  Divide that number by 2 and put a negative sign in front.  So -128 is this number for a byte.  The following will be discussed below, but if you had 16 bits to work with, you have 65536 possibilities.  Divide by 2 and add the negative sign gives a value of -32768.
}}

===== Floating point representation =====
A generic real number with a decimal part can also be expressed in binary format. 
For instance 110.01 in binary corresponds to:

&lt;math&gt; 1 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 + 0 \times 2^{-1} + 1 \times 2^{-2} = {\color{Blue} 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^{-2}} = 6.25 &lt;/math&gt;

Exponential notation (also known as scientific notation, or standard form, ''when used with base 10'', as in &lt;font style=&quot;font-size:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^8&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/font&gt;) can be also used and the same number expressed as:

&lt;math&gt; 1.1001 \times 2^2 \qquad ( = 11.001 \times 2^1 = 110.01 )&lt;/math&gt;

When there is only one non-zero digit on the left of the decimal point, the notation is termed normalized. 

In computing applications a real number is represented by a sign bit (S) an exponent (e) and a mantissa (M). The exponent field needs to represent both positive and negative exponents. To do this, a bias E is added to the actual exponent in order to get the stored exponent, and the sign bit (S), which indicates whether or not the number is negative, is transformed into either +1 or -1, giving s. A real number is thus represented as:

&lt;math&gt; f = s \times M \times 2^{e-E} &lt;/math&gt;

S, e and M are concatenated one after the other in a 32-bit word to create a '''single''' precision floating point number and in a 64-bit doubleword to create a '''double''' precision one. For the single float type, 8 bits are used for the exponent and 23 bits for the mantissa, and the exponent offset is E=127. For the double type 11 bits are used for the exponent and 52 for the mantissa, and the exponent offset is E=1023.

There are two types of floating point numbers. ''Normalized'' and ''denormalized''. A normalized number will have an exponent e in the range 0&lt;e&lt;2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 (between 00000000 and 11111111, non-inclusive) in a single precision float, and an exponent e in the range 0&lt;e&lt;2&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 (between 00000000000 and 11111111111, non-inclusive) for a double float. Normalized numbers are represented as sign times 1.''Mantissa'' times 2&lt;sup&gt;e-E&lt;/sup&gt;. Denormalized numbers are numbers where the exponent is 0. They are represented as sign times 0.''Mantissa'' times 2&lt;sup&gt;1-E&lt;/sup&gt;. Denormalized numbers are used to store the value 0, where the exponent and mantissa are both 0. Floating point numbers can store both +0 and -0, depending on the sign. When the number isn't normalized or denormalized (it's exponent is all 1s) the number will be plus or minus infinity if the mantissa is zero and depending on the sign, or plus or minus NaN (Not a Number) if the mantissa isn't zero and depending on the sign.

For instance the binary representation of the number 5.0 (using float type) is:

0 10000001 01000000000000000000000 

The first bit is 0, meaning the number is positive, the exponent is 129-127=2, and the mantissa is 1.01 (note the leading one is not included in the binary representation). 1.01 corresponds to 1.25 in decimal representation. Hence 1.25*4=5.

Floating point numbers are not always exact representations of values. a number like 1010110110001110101001101 couldn't be represented by a single precision floating point number because, disregarding the leading 1 which isn't part of the mantissa, there are 24 bits, and a single precision float can only store 23 numbers in its mantissa, so the 1 at the end would have to be dropped because it is the least significant bit. Also, there are some value which simply cannot be represented in binary which can be easily represented in decimal, E.g. 0.3 in decimal would be 0.0010011001100110011... or something. A lot of other numbers cannot be exactly represented by a binary floating point number, no matter how many bits it use for it's mantissa, just because it would create a repeating pattern like this.

{{TODO|
*Add a few comments on different standards...
*Add some images showing the bit representations like [[w:IEEE_754]] has

=== Locality (hardware) ===
Variables have two distinct characteristics: those that are created on the stack (local variables), and those that are accessed via a hard-coded memory address (global variables).

==== Globals ====
Typically a variable is bound to a particular address in [[w:computer memory |computer memory]] that is automatically assigned to at runtime, with a fixed number of bytes determined by the size of the object type of a variable and any operations performed on the variable effects one or more [[w:value (computer science)|values]] stored in that particular memory location.

All global defined variables will have static lifetime. Only those not defined as &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; will permit external linkage by default.

==== Locals ====
If the size and location of a variable is unknown beforehand, the location in memory of that variable is stored in another variable instead, and the size of the original variable is determined by the size of the type of the second value storing the memory location of the first. This is called [[w:reference (computer science)|referencing]], and the variable holding the other variables memory location is called a pointer.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauces|Sauces]]

'''White Sauce''' is a common name (chiefly in the US and Britain) for the classic [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|Béchamel Sauce]], one of the &quot;Mother Sauces&quot; of French Cuisine. In French cooking, [[Cookbook:Béchamel Sauce|Béchamel Sauce]] is rarely used on its own; it is more often used as the base for derivitave sauces or as a binder for gratinees. Béchamel's American cousin, on the other hand, is frequently used as a finished product. White sauce is generally more highly seasoned than is Béchamel, but the procedure for making both is the same.

Recipes from the 19th century and earlier often call for slowly simmering white sauce, for an hour or more, with whole onions and spices, then straining the finished sauce. Today, it is more common to use dried/ground seasonings; there is little difference in the finished product.

==Ingredients==

* ¼ cup (4 Tablespoons) unsalted butter
* ¼ cup (60g) all-purpose flour
* 2 cups (480ml) whole milk
* ¾ tsp. onion salt
* ¼ tsp. ground white pepper
* 1 tsp. ground mustard seed
* pinch fresh-ground nutmeg
* 1 bay leaf

==Procedure==
# Make a white [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]]: melt the butter in a sauce pan over medium heat until the foam subsides.  Add the flour and whisk together, still over the heat, for 2-3 minutes. The flour should lose its raw smell, but should not brown.
# Add the milk to the roux while whisking quickly but smoothly to create a smooth mixture. 
# Add the seasonings and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Simmer the sauce until it lightly coats the back of a spoon.
# Remove the bay leaf, taste and adjust for salt and pepper, and serve.

==Notes==
* A sweet white sauce can be made by replacing the seasoning items with sugar (preferably caster). Adding rum or brandy to taste will make this the sweet sauce traditionally served with Christmas pudding.
* The seasonings can be adjusted according to individual taste and the intended use: some dishes will require a more highly seasoned sauce, others a milder concoction.
* The flavor can also be altered by adding various herbs (parsley, celery leaves, thyme, etc.) along with the other seasonings. Generally additions should be strained from the sauce prior to use - straining would not apply, for instance, to traditional parsley sauce, typically served with fish, in which the green of the herb is an integral ingredient. Keep in mind that the sauce should be mildly flavored and that any additions should complement the finished dish, not overpower it.
* White sauce can be made ahead-of-time: remove from the heat and press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the sauce to prevent it from forming a skin. Reheat over a low flame, stirring constantly, until it barely simmers.
* In the event that lumps have formed in your sauce, simply pour through a medium strainer before serving.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|Cuisine of The United States]] | [[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta Recipes]]

Fettuccine Alfredo is a dish of fettuccine pasta with a sauce made of cream, butter and cheese.  

In popular American cooking the cream preparation is sometimes called 'Alfredo Sauce', however, in Italy, the sauce does not necessarily have such a specific name or generally accepted understanding of its composition.

This recipe will make enough sauce for one pound of pasta, which, together, could serve 6 as a first course.

== Ingredients ==
* 1¾ cups (400 ml) heavy [[cookbook:cream|cream]]
* 6 tbs. unsalted [[cookbook:butter|butter]]
* 8.5 ounces (240 grams) grated [[cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] or asiago cheese
* 1 tsp. [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* fresh-ground [[cookbook:pepper|black pepper]]
* pinch of fresh-ground [[cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]]

== Preparation ==
# Combine 1¼ cups (300 ml) cream and the butter in a pan large enough to accommodate the sauce and later the pound of pasta.
# Heat over a low flame, stirring frequently, until the butter is melted and the cream comes to a bare simmer.
# Remove the pan from the heat once the butter is evenly incorporated into the cream.
# Cook the pasta, draining it a little before it reaches the al dente stage.  The pasta should be slightly undercooked before being added to the sauce because it will continue to cook while the sauce is being finished.
# Drain the pasta.
# Add the drained pasta, ½ cup (100 ml) of cream, the cheese, the salt, the nutmeg, and several grinds of the pepper mill to the pan
# Heat the pasta and sauce over a low flame, tossing continuously, until the cheese melts into the sauce and the sauce thickens slightly, about one to two minutes. You can add chopped parsley as a garnish mixed into the sauce.

== Notes ==
* Alfredo Di Lelio, for whom the dish is named, was a Roman innkeeper. Between the 1910s and the 1950s he owned a popular restaurant named Alfredo all'Augusteo in Piazza Augusto Imperatore in the center of the city. The restaurant, now called &quot;Il Vero Alfredo - Alfredo di Roma&quot;, is run by the granddaughter of Alfredo Di Lelio, Ines Di Lelio.
* The original name of the dish, created in 1914, was ''Fettuccine al triplo burro'' (Fettuccine with triple butter).
* Fettuccine is the traditional pasta for Alfredo and its variations because the broad noodles provide just the right platform for the butter fat and cheese.
* Fresh egg pasta is greatly preferred by some over dried pasta for cream and cheese sauces because the sauce sometimes clings more readily to fresh pasta than it does to dried.

__NOTOC__
{{recipe}}

The Wikipedia article on [[w:Macaroni and Cheese|Macaroni and Cheese]] mentions that besides the Bechamel (white) sauce base Macaroni and Cheese used in this recipe, it is also made as a baked casserole (in other words, using a [[cookbook:custard|custard]] base of milk &amp; eggs). For the baked custard kind of Macaroni and Cheese, see the recipes [[Cookbook:Macaroni Pie|Macaroni Pie]] and [[Cookbook:Macaroni &amp; Cheese (Baked)|Macaroni &amp; Cheese (Baked)]].

==Ingredients==
* ½ c [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* ½ c [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 4 c [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 c [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]]
* 1 c [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] or [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack cheese]]
* ½ tsp [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]], or to taste
* cooked [[Cookbook:Macaroni|macaroni]]

==Procedure==
# Make a [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]] using half cup of butter (a stick) and half a cup of flour.  
# Add 4 cups of heated milk and stir until smooth to complete the [[Cookbook:White Sauce|white sauce]].
# Add cheese and cayenne pepper.
# Finally, mix with a pot of cooked pasta.

==Alternate Recipe==

* 8 oz (by weight) [[Cookbook:Macaroni|elbow macaroni]]
* ½ cups [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* ¼ cups [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* ½ cups [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] (of the chef's preference)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* dash of dried [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] and [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

Fill a pot with water, and add Macaroni and salt.  Bring to boil stirring occasionally.  While waiting to boil, in pot heat milk, and grate cheese into milk.  This should create a basic cheese sauce.  If too thin, add more grated cheese, if too thick, add more milk.  

When Macaroni becomes soft (chef's discretion) drain.  Melt butter in pot and replace macaroni (without water). Stir until macaroni is completely covered.  Add 1 egg, unscrambled.  Stir until completely incorporated.  Add cheese sauce, and herbs.  Stir well, and serve hot.

==Concerning Sauce==
The cheese sauce used in macaroni and cheese is generally a variant on [[Cookbook:Sauce Mornay|Sauce Mornay]], a french sauce consisting of [[Cookbook:Bechamel Sauce|Bechamel sauce]] with added cheese. The sauce can be heavily customized so long as the liquid ingredients do not exceed the capacity of the roux to thicken it to a usable consistency. Common additions include white pepper or hot mustard, but Worcestershire sauce or even diluted tomato paste can make interesting additions. Fresh herbs should be left until the end of the recipe, while dried herbs will soften nicely in the cheese sauce. Other possibilities for experimentation involve replacing some of the milk with other liquids, with beer and stock being two avenues of exploration. Of course, the most obvious change one can make is in the types of cheese. 

The cheeses used in the sauce may be of any sort, however one should keep in mind that at least some of the cheese should be sharp-tasting (lest the sauce be bland) and that some cheeses melt very well (soft bleu, gruyere, cheddar) while others do not (e.g. feta). The most common mixture in American macaroni and cheese is parmesan and cheddar, with aged cheddar providing a more assertive flavour which some children may dislike.

Packaged mixes use instead a highly processed sauce based on milk ingredients alongside a large amount of citric acid, which is responsible for both the pronounced sharpness of commercial cheese sauce (&quot;Nacho Cheese&quot;) as well as its distinctive texture. This can be done at home by melting one or more cheeses into a solution of a liquid (commonly water, beer or stock) with 1 teaspoon of sodium citrate, available at large markets as 'sour salt.'

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Dan.  Good work on the whole Manual thing.  I'm the guy who's stuck a bunch of words on the [[MMM/Post-production/Editing|Editing Page]], and have a couple of suggestions.  Have noticed that the Editing link on the manual's central [[MMM|page]] needs a bit of work.  Firstly, it doesn't lead to the Editing page.  Secondly, it contains an Effects link - unnecessary and in fact inapropriate.  Thirdly, it links to the Build-your-system page which I suggest should live in the Tools_and_equipment section on that main page.

I'd have a crack myself but am only a beginner at this editing stuff.

Look forward to seeing you around.

: Hi Dave.  Thanks loads for getting involved.  Yeah, the structure of the book is a bit shoddy at the moment.  It's half way between the old naming system (Movie Making Manual-Page Name) and the new naming system (MMM/Chapter Name/Page Name).  Sorry about this.  I hope to get a chance to fix it soon.

Why have you been blanking pages like [[Movie Making Manual-Cinematography]]? [[User:Angela|Angela]] 22:42, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

: Hi.  I've been blanking pages like [[Movie Making Manual-Cinematography]] because the [[Movie Making Manual]] is now adopting a category-based navigation model.  The [[Movie Making Manual-Cinematography]] page used to be a table of contents for the Cinematography section... that role is now provided by the [[:category:cinematography]] page.  But you're right to raise an alarm: I should have put forwarding links on the old pages instead of blanking them.  I am now going through those blanked pages and putting forwarding links on them.

Glad you like my &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; idea - seems to work pretty well for your book too.  I like your Cuba photos and I expect my girlfriend will too, she's writing a novel about Cuba and is trying to get funding to get there to make sure she's accurate.  She's a photographer in Manchester - lisabarryphoto@hotmail.com.  Please let her know if you have advice on obtaining funding for that, or anything else possibly relevant.

==invitation of a wikibook study==

Hi Jack, 
I'm inkeys, a graduate student at Indiana University. My advisor and I, we're working on a study of wikibooks online authors' experience. I read the movie making manual. It's impressive. We would like to invite you to participate in this study and we'll learn from your experience. The formal invitation letter is attached below. Thank you so much. 

This is an invitation to participate in a case study related to the Wikibook project. The purpose of the study is to understand online authors’ self-efficacy, which involves the motivation to write a Wikibook, beliefs regarding one’s knowledge of the topic, previous experience and success in writing a Wikibook, and ability to help coordinate the Wikibook project and interact with other authors. If you agree to participate in this particular case study, please email (cl17@indiana.edu) and we will schedule a one hour interview with you at your convenience by phone or by email. Your responses will be anonymous.

Your input to this project is greatly appreciated. 
Thanks for your time and consideration, 

inkeys

== Climate change ==

Hi Dan,
I added a link to my suggestions on solving climate change (made a wikibook herefore) at your Climate change wikibook.
Hope that's OK.
Thanks,

== ELF Files ==

{{Wikipedia|Executable and Linkable Format}}

The '''ELF file format''' (short for Executable and Linking Format) was developed by Unix System Laboratories to be a successor to previous file formats such as COFF and a.out. In many respects, the ELF format is more powerful and versatile than previous formats, and has widely become the standard on Linux, Solaris, IRIX, and FreeBSD (although the FreeBSD-derived Mac OS X uses the Mach-O format instead).  ELF has also been adopted by OpenVMS for Itanium and BeOS for x86.

Historically, Linux has not always used ELF; Red Hat Linux 4 was the first time that distribution used ELF; previous versions had used the a.out format.

ELF Objects are broken down into different segments and/or sections. These can be located by using the ELF header found at the first byte of the object. The ELF header provides the location for both the program header and the section header. Using these data structures the rest of the ELF objects contents can be found, this includes .text and .data segments which contain code and data respectively. 

The GNU readelf utility, from the binutils package, is a common tool for parsing ELF objects.

=== File Format ===
[[Image:Elf-layout--en.svg|thumb|200px|An ELF file has two views: the program header shows the ''segments'' used at run-time, while the section header lists the set of ''sections'' of the binary.]]

Each ELF file is made up of one ELF header, followed by file data.  The file data can include:

* Program header table, describing zero or more segments
* Section header table, describing zero or more sections
* Data referred to by entries in the program or section header table

The segments contain information that is necessary for runtime execution of the file, while sections contain important data for linking and relocation. Each byte in the entire file is taken by no more than one section at a time, but there can be orphan bytes, which are not covered by a section. In the normal case of a Unix executable one or more sections are enclosed in one segment.

{{-}}

== Relocatable ELF Files ==

Relocatable ELF files are created by compilers. They need to be linked before running.

Those files are often found in &lt;code&gt;.a&lt;/code&gt; archives, with a &lt;code&gt;.o&lt;/code&gt; extension.

== a.out Files ==

[[w:a.out|a.out]] is a very simple format consisting of a header (at offset 0) which contains the size of 3 executable sections (code, data, bss), plus pointers to additional information such as relocations (for .o files), symbols and symbols' strings.
The actual sections contents follows the header. Offsets of different sections are computed from the size of the previous section.

The a.out format is now rarely used.

=== Writing feedback===
Teachers can use the following pages to provide students with information about specific errors in their writing. If the students' papers are graded online, write a short comment and add a link to one of these pages.
* [[Rhetoric and Composition/Enumeration consistency|Enumeration consistency]]
* [[Rhetoric and Composition/Unclear demonstrative pronoun reference|Unclear demonstrative pronoun reference]]


When providing feedback to any writer—whether they are a peer or a student, there are a few general rules of thumb.
Make comments specific and clear.  Instead of simply using words like ‘Good’ and ‘Awkward’ to summarize a comment, try using phrases that directly state what sounds awkward, or which part of the paragraph / sentence sounds good. However, be attune to not smother the students’ paper with writing. This can be detrimental to the students’ psyche and affect their writing process. Try to work with a theme. If a paper has recurring errors in a specific area, address this error once and provide the grammatical rule (if one applies) or provide an example to help the student improve.


For example, in the following sentence a writer is using two different verb tenses within the sentence. 


'''Example''': &quot;From outside the building I could hear the opening bands tearing through their sets, and all the way from the sidewalk I felt the beat and vibrations from the drums and bass guitar literally '''make''' my rib cage shake&quot;

'''Example Instructor / Peer Comment''': &quot;We have two different verb tenses within this sentence. For clarity you'll want to stick with a single verb tense. I would suggest using something like '...'''making''' my rib shake'...&quot;



Inevitably, this type of constructive feedback will require more time with each assignment the person is grading. However, constructive criticism may be the best route to see positive and significant changes within a written work. To speed up the feedback process consider inserting links to websites like the [http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/ Purdue OWL], St. Cloud State University's Literacy Education Online [http://leo.stcloudstate.edu/ (LEO)] or other online university writing labs. Listed below are different attitudes to consider adopting while providing feedback.


'''7 Types of Active Feedback'''

1.      Correcting- the removal of errors or mistakes from written work

2.      Emoting- to add expression or emotion to a written work

3.      Describing- to give an account or convey an idea or impression within writing

4.      Suggesting- to offer or propose changes for consideration

5.      Questioning- to put a question to, or expressing doubt about an aspect within writing 

6.      Reminding- to cause a person to remember or to make something aware to the writer

7.      Assigning- to designate additional writing for a particular purpose



[http://www.longmancomppro.com '''Attitudes as a Reader:''']

''Editor''- Provide feedback mainly on grammar, punctuation, syntax, sentence structure and word choice. This time of feedback is typically time consuming. Requires thorough knowledge of Standard Written English (SWE) in addition to strict adherence to grammar rules. Those who choose to provide editor-type should be wary that the criticism is balanced with praise. 

''Average Reader''- The average reader feedback focuses primarily on what the writer is attempting to communicate. Reading the text as though it were an ordinary magazine or newspaper, the author gains perspective through the reader's reactions to the text. Text reactions include: responding to descriptions, arguments, and examples provided within the paper. 

''Academic Reader''- The academic reader analyzes the text for how well the paper conforms to the standards of academic discourse. A knowledge of academic standards is needed in order to provide feedback as an academic reader.

''Coach''- A coach is someone who actively facilitates the development of writing. This is perhaps the most complex attitude as it adopts various aspects of the three previous attitudes listed.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;No passion in the world is equal to the passion to alter someone else's draft.&quot;|caption=-- H.G. Wells}}

Sooner or later, someone is going to hand you a piece of writing and ask for your opinion. You may be asked to review another student's essay as part of your class work. Perhaps a friend or a younger brother or sister has come to you for help. If you develop a reputation for being a good writer, then the chances are good that even your boss might ask you to look over letters or policy statements and offer your professional opinion. In any case, if you really want to do a good job in these situations, you're going to need reviewing skills. You're going to need to be able to identify problems, suggest alternatives, and, more importantly, support everything you say with reasonable claims. Furthermore, you must do all this in a convincing way that makes the writer want to make the changes you suggest. You must know what's wrong with a document, why it's wrong, and how to fix it. 

You've probably heard the saying, &quot;A writer is his own worst critic.&quot; Whoever said this undoubtedly suffered from poor self-reviewing skills. After all, it's easier to spot problems in other people's writing because our own ego (or pride) doesn't get in the way. Another problem is that sometimes we get so caught up in what we want to get across in our writing that we don't pay enough attention to how we're expressing it -- a sentence that makes perfect sense to us might be total gibberish to someone else. Thankfully, these are all problems that can be overcome. You can learn to fairly and accurately review your own work. One way you can get better at self-reviewing is to spend time reviewing other people's work. Eventually, you'll develop a knack for spotting errors that will serve you well as you edit and revise your own work. 

Writers, particularly new writers, often find that letting other writers review their work is tremendously helpful. Most universities have writing centers, where students can have their essays reviewed for free by experienced student writers or tutors. These tutors can work with you one-on-one to help you improve your writing and earn better grades. 

You should realize that reviewing your work, like planning, drafting, or revising, is a recursive process. It is not something a writer does just at the end of his work. For instance, you may want to write an introduction to an essay and have it reviewed by a teacher or classmate before trudging forward. If you're on the wrong track, you'd be better off knowing about it sooner rather than later -- especially if a deadline or due date is looming.

In the academic world, journal articles and books are nearly always &quot;peer reviewed&quot; before they are accepted for publication. Sometimes these reviews are &quot;blind,&quot; meaning that neither the writer nor the reviewers know each others' identities. This process is meant to make the process fair and ensure that every scholar gets a chance to get her work published. Academic reviewers must evaluate a work, recommend that it be published or rejected, and (hopefully) offer the writer substantial advice about how his work can be improved. 

In this chapter, we'll talk about how to develop the skills you'll need to become a star reviewer. We'll start by discussing &quot;criteria,&quot; or the standards you'll stick to when writing reviews. We'll talk about what to look for in a document and how to provide the very best advice to the writer. Finally, we'll talk about how to handle criticism from reviewers who evaluate your work.
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;You write to communicate to the hearts and minds of others what's burning inside you.  And we edit to let the fire show through the smoke.&quot;|caption=-- Arthur Plotnik}}

== Establishing Criteria ==
Let's suppose that you just gave your paper to your roommate and asked her to look it over. You explain that you've been working on the paper for three days and that you really want to earn an A. &quot;I want your honest opinion,&quot; you say. &quot;Don't worry about hurting my feelings. What do you think?&quot;

You watch your roommate's face as she reads your paper. She grimaces. Laughs. Yawns. Finally, she hands you the paper back and says, &quot;This sucks.&quot; 

This may be the type of &quot;review&quot; you are accustomed to receiving -- overly critical and not very helpful. Perhaps you agree that your paper is in trouble and needs help, but without a better understanding of what's wrong, you aren't likely to be able to do much about it. Furthermore, how can you trust your roommate's judgment of your paper? What if it just so happens that your roommate is neurotic about starting sentences with &quot;But,&quot; and, seeing such sentences in your paper, decided right there that the paper was terrible? 

Ultimately, what makes an evaluation worthwhile is the soundness of its criteria. As a writer, you want to know not just whether someone likes your paper, but also what factors they are taking into consideration when they review your paper. Both the reviewer and the person being reviewed need to be as clear as possible about the criteria that will be used to evaluate the work. Are your reviewers only looking at your grammar, or are they also determining the rationality of your arguments? Does a comma splice make a bigger difference than a rough transition between paragraphs? 

All of these matters should be spelled out clearly beforehand, either by the writer or the reviewer.  As a writer, what are you personally working on?  It's not a bad idea to think about your strengths and challenges as a writer before handing over your paper to a reviewer, or to use work that has been returned to you in the past with feedback.  For example, if you're writing a paper for a professor you've had before, and who has made comments on your past work, use those comments to provide your reviewer with a focus.  If you are the reviewer in this situation, ask to see the assignment and rubric, if possible.  You can also ask the writer for specific guidelines, areas of greatest need, or even anything s/he might know about the grader.  Is the person giving the grade unconcerned with punctuation conventions but a martinet about tense shifting?  The point is, the more focused the reviewer and writer are, the more effective the reviews are.

==Writing Helpful Comments==

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;There are two kinds of editors, those who correct your copy and those who say it's wonderful.&quot;|caption=-- Theodore H. White}}

In the example above, you were not able to gain any insights or knowledge from your roommate letting you know that your paper &quot;sucks.&quot;  What you wanted was some kind of feedback that would help you improve your paper, so you could get a good grade. You don't know if your paper &quot;sucks&quot; because it lacked a strong thesis, if it sucks because your writing strayed from the assignment, or if it sucks because of grammatical errors. You can be a better self- and peer-reviewer than your roommate was.  Given the previous example, how hard can it be?
When you're reviewing your own paper or the paper of a friend or classmate, ask yourself a few questions:

ORGANIZATION
# What are your initial thoughts? What strengths and weaknesses does the paper have? What parts confused you, or might be confusing to other readers? What's the most important thing that the writer is trying to say?
# How is the paper you're reviewing organized?  Again, does it start with the broad and move to specifics?  Do all sentences support the paragraph's topic sentence, and do all paragraphs support the thesis?  Is there an &lt;I&gt;Introduction&lt;/I&gt; that draws in the reader, or does it restate the assignment and become redundant? Is the paper organized in a way that will make sense to readers? Does the writer employ transitions effectively? Does the paper flow from beginning to end? &lt;br&gt;
FOCUS
# Is the paper focused on the assignment?  Does it follow the same thought throughout the paper, or does it jump from subject to subject?  Do I feel like I'm still learning about/thinking about the same subject at the end of the paper that I was at the beginning of the paper? &lt;br&gt;
# Try to paraphrase the thesis of the paper as a promise: ''In this paper, the writer will...'' Does the writer fulfill his/her obligation stated in the thesis?
# What's the writer's position on the issue? What words does the writer use to indicate his/her position?
STYLE
# In what style is the paper written?  Does it &lt;I&gt;work&lt;/I&gt; for the subject matter and assignment? Will the paper appeal to its intended audience? Is the writing at an appropriate level for the target audience? &lt;br&gt;
DEVELOPMENT
# Does the title indicate what the paper is about?  Does it catch your interest? Does the opening paragraph draw you in? If not, can you suggest a different approach to catch the readers' attention?
# How is the development of the paper carried out?  Does it start with a broad subject and then move to something more specific? &lt;br&gt;
# Does the concluding sentence draw the argument of the paper to a close by bringing together the main points provided in the paper, or does it just end? Does the writer conclude in a memorable way, or does he/she simply trail off?  If the ending is too abrupt or too vague, can you suggest some other way to conclude the paper? Does the ending introduce any new topics?
CONVENTIONS
# Are common or appropriate writing conventions followed? Are grammar, spelling, punctuation and other mechanics observed?

While reviewing the paper, make notes in the margins of any problems you find.  If you believe that developing a paragraph a little bit more would be helpful to the argument, write &lt;more&gt;.  If you are unclear of something, write &lt;? not sure&gt;.  If you notice a missing comma, insert it in the correct spot, but be sure to set it off somehow so that you or your friend will notice the correction. If another word might work better, write &lt;WC&gt; to indicate inappropriate word choice.

Please note: It is important not to overwhelm your writer with comments.  As much as possible, try to avoid repeating similar comments (e.g. don't correct every single comma error you find).  Also, although it can be tempting to make some of the changes you suggest yourself, you never want to rewrite the work you are reviewing.

==Responding to Criticism==

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;I am forced to say that I have many fiercer critics than myself.&quot;|caption=--Irwin Shaw}}

Nobody likes to be told that what they are doing isn't right. But what separates good writers from other writers is that good writers are able to take criticism, realizing that nobody is perfect, and use the criticism to help them, either with the assignment at hand, or with writing assignments in the future.

If your roommate tells you that your paper ''sucks,'' you probably want to ask him or her ''why'' it sucks. If your roommate says that you are continually writing [[Rhetoric_and_Composition/Run-on_sentence|run-on sentences]], ask for advice on how to correct them or look in a writing guide to learn how to fix them. By handling criticism constructively, you'll be more aware of your common errors and less likely to repeat them, or at least will know how to find and correct them the next time you write.

If, while meeting with a tutor, you learn that you need further development of some of your ideas for clarity, revisit your writing and judge for yourself whether or not you do.  Ask yourself if you understand since you are the one who did all of the research and ''know'' what you mean (probably a good indication that the tutor was right), or if you are comfortable that a reader would understand what you are saying without more information.

Remember: as the writer, you're in control of your paper.  When people offer criticism, they're usually just trying to help you.  Try to keep that in mind.  Take the suggestions when you think they make sense, and discard the ones that don't.

==Peer Review Sample==

Here is an example of an essay submitted for peer review. The assignment is to write a paper about anything in nature: a plant, an animal, a natural disaster, anything. Practice reviewing with the steps mentioned above. What would you say to the author?

{{SAMPLE|sampletext= The Jalapeno: an Ode.

In the backyard of my parent’s house survives an ambiance of relaxation. An alluring pool has been my oasis that anticipates the hot, yet hardly tormenting summer days (5). As I look on, the pool’s surface resembles a trance that sparkles and fades into my squinting eyes. The gleaming blue and white water magnetizes me and nearly forces my body into my bathing suit, tanning lotion in hand. I race for my beach towels, usually the Budweiser one and the other that is striped with green and blue lines. I then carry a reclining chair and head for the poolside, not far from the diving board, where the sun awaits me. With every third or fourth step gracing the searing cement, I must dip my feet in the pool’s merciful and cool dampness.

When I arrive to my destination, with the shaded patio still in view, I unfold the towels and lay comfortably on the reclining chair. Beneath the sun and its warm smile, I feel its soft kiss upon my browning skin. I look to my right and see a competitive game of Scrabble in action amongst my family members. Nearby, my dog moseys on over to see if I will give him a gentle pat, knowing all too well that the sun is beckoning. To my left, I gaze upon the intricately planted landscape. A few stubborn, yellow Tulips tend to show themselves from time to time while sitting under a few hanging baskets that support brave pink and purple perennials. Surrounding them are many other bushes and plants hovering over aesthetic night lamps (3). 

To my front are the suspicious and rather bitter neighbors just past the determined fence. The day is spent best without catching eyes with them (4). Behind me is the house that has kept watch over me for more than ten years. With its light gray siding and white shudders, it doesn’t pose much of a threat but hardly as great of a caress as the yard I lay in. While there are no trees in our backyard, our neighbor’s trees lean over the fence gently as if their branches were hands dipping themselves into holy water.
Subtly, I glimpse upon a pair of dragonflies making love in midair. I become slightly jealous of their incessant nature. And no sooner is my comfort found that I bounce away from my chair at the sight of bees and their territorial buzz. More often than not, I am unharmed; however, their intimidating presence remains unpleasant in the heat (5).
A gentle breeze will bless my begging and perspiring skin, but when it is callous, the pool invites me for a quick dive (3). The surface of the glistening mirage pierces slightly at my skin raising every hair but altogether swathes my entire body. Cast into an oblivion, my hair swells like that of a mermaid’s. Although my lips are sealed, the chlorine finds a way to seep into my tongue (2).

As I surge back to the surface, my nose wrinkles blissfully at the scent of the chicken and steak kabobs savored tenderly (5) with orange bell peppers, white onions, and plump, brown mushrooms (1). They cook patiently on the grill (3). Eager for dinner, I paddle myself to the shallow end of the pool and lead myself up the stairs. The steadfast cement is back at my feet. I quickly grab for my towels and head for the patio table that is secured by the rescuing shade. I faintly hear Led Zeppelin singing from the old, makeshift radio. I crack open a mildly cool High Life that has been sitting on the table for some time and let the sour suds have their way. I grab a Marlboro, tuck it between my lips and strike a fast match at it. As the unrefined smoke dances past my fingers, I slowly breathe contently, gazing up at the tranquil sky, fully aware that this place has dependably masked my outside tides (3).
|caption=Sample: Backyard  Bathing}}

'''Sample Comments: Here, the peer reviewer has made matched remarks to specific sentences and passages in the essay and has included a more detailed global comment last.'''

1. Describe the scent of the location

2. Good descriptions of the essence of the back yard and pool

3. Good use of personification and imagery

4. Include more description of the neighbors

5. Unnecessary descriptive words, particularly adjectives and adverbs

6. You got some weedy adjectives and adverbs going on. EVERYTHING has been gilded and painted up; this is like the prose equivalent of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:RuPaul.jpg RuPaul] (the one on the left). Cut as many adjectives and adverbs out as you can. In fact, I hate to say this, but don't &quot;describe the scent of the location&quot; unless the scent of the location is important/remarkable. Do I care that you ate awesome kabobs? I might, if it's important/remarkable in any way, but so far, no. What this looks like to me is, somebody told you to write a descriptive scene, you thought, &quot;how pointless!&quot;, so you wrote a descriptive scene with no point. Is there a reason to describe this backyard pool Eden? Did a murder happen there later on? Is that where you first learned an Important Truth About Life? Are you going to get into a fist fight with the neighbors? Is there, in short, anything interesting at all about it?

==Peer Review Sample 2==
Here is another example of an essay submitted for peer review on the same topic as Peer Review Sample 1.  Again, practice reviewing with the steps mentioned above.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext= The Jalapeno: an Ode.

The jalapeno— is it a tasty cooking element, or a national mystery?  As a lover of all things spicy, I find myself asking questions about the nation’s most elusive pepper: where did it get its name? Where did it originate from?  What makes it so spicy? How and where does it grow? And, most importantly, what kinds of food include the jalapeno?  These questions are only natural to ask oneself when faced with the utterly fascinating pepper.  However, through some difficult research, mental travel to the wild regions of the past, and a little bribery, the answers can and will be found.  

But who to ask?  If I lived in Texas I would ask Stacey Snow, Ms. Jalapeno 2005.   She was crowned Ms. Jalapeno at the 27th annual Jalapeno festival in Laredo Texas.  This festival is featured on the travel channel, and is commonly known as the “hottest weekend of the year.”  This festival has amazingly unique entertainment: the jalapeno egg toss, the blind jalapeno toss, the jalapeno spitting contest, the “some like it hot” cook off, the land raft race, the three-legged sack race, and a good old fashion game of tug-of-war. 

	The jalapeno is named after Jalapa, capital of Veracruz, Mexico.  However, the jalapeno’s popularity is not completely foreign.  In 1995 New Mexico named the jalapeno the official state pepper, with chili peppers and pinto beans as the state vegetable.  The jalapeno is part of the chili pepper family.  The family also includes anaheim, cayenne, poblano, and serrano. 

	The jalapeno is not native to Minnesota; in fact, it is not native to the United States.  It is thanks to Christopher Columbus that we have the spicy treat.  Still today the pepper is a popular favorite, with Texas producing half of the 14 million gallons of jalapenos produced each year in the United States.  Jalapeno flavored potato and tortilla chips weigh in at 17 million pounds produced each year.

	The spicy bite in jalapenos can send tears down its consumer’s face.  This burning sensation is no accident; it is due to a chemical called capsaicinoids.  There are five varieties, with capsaicin being the hottest and most famous.  The capsaicins in jalapenos give them the burning sensation.  When the fire in the mouth sensation occurs, the brain releases endorphins into the blood stream.  These act as a natural pain reliever.

	The jalapeno plant is pod-like, and usually grows from 2 to 3 feet tall.  It is single stemmed and grows upright.  Though there are literally countless forms of wild peppers, the jalapeno is considered a domestic plant.  The pods are cylindrical, which flourish in semi-arid climates with dry air and irrigation.  The plant matures between seventy and eighty days generally producing twenty-five to thirty-five pods per plant.

	Jalapeno foods come in many shapes, sizes, and flavors. The most recent jalapeno phenomenon to hit the market is jalapeno jelly. Originally from Lake Jackson Texas, jalapeno jelly was first marketed in 1978.  This jelly is often lime-green, with a sweet flavor, and the same consistency as normal jelly.  It is fitting that this jelly originated from Texas, because the jalapeno is the official Texas state pepper, along with the chiltepin; not so coincidentally, these are the two peppers used in the states official dish: chili. 
	Though there are many types of hot peppers, the jalapeno distinguishes itself in a number of ways.  First, the jalapeno is most often green when mature, and is about 2 inches long with cracks in the stem.  The hotness is also immediate after a bite.  The thing that makes the jalapeno so different from other foods is the cult phenomena surrounding it.  Figurines, websites, and even academic papers have been formed on the jalapeno craze.

	Most important to the jalapeno are the recipes.  Many wild jalapeno recipes do exist, with jalapeno bread, jalapeno sauce, stuffed jalapenos, chicken and cream cheese with jalapenos, coca-cola ham glaze with jalapeno, jalapeno martini, jalapeno hushpuppies, jalapeno soufflé, jalapeno-basil vinaigrette, and tamale pie being just a select few.  Dried jalapenos are known as chipotles, another common ingredient in many dishes.  In Texas, people even go so far as to drink jalapeno coffee and jalapeno tea! Yuck!

It is safe to say that the jalapeno is both a tasty cooking element and a national mystery.  Any time a recipe is made, the jalapeno will be there.  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but rest assured, someone, somewhere (probably in Texas), will add a jalapeno to it.  However, the day the jalopsicle becomes the most popular frozen treat, consider it the day we have gone too far.
 |caption=Sample Draft}}

'''Sample Comments: Here, the peer reviewer has organized her/his comments based on the five criteria and has made specific references to sentences and passages where appropriate.'''

ORGANIZATION
# After the introduction paragraph, there is not much narrowing.  The topic broadly seems to be jalapenos.  Perhaps the writer could try picking one specific question and sticking to that.
# The organization needs to be improved.  Perhaps repeating the questions would help, or as previously stated, sticking to the development of one specific question.
FOCUS
# The paper seems to fulfill the assignment very well, but it does jump subject somewhat, particularly beween paragraphs 3 and 4.  I do like the theme of the jalapeño being presented as a national mystery; perhaps that could become the thesis statement.
# Unfortunately, he thesis of the paper doesn’t seem to exist.  The questions in the first paragraph gives the reader an idea of where the paper is headed, but there really is no statement explaining what the writer is trying to prove.
# Does the author have a position?  If he/she does it must be that he/she reveres the jalapeno. There doesn’t seem to be much controversy in here for the author to support or oppose.
STYLE
# The title is clever, but could be a little more specific.  It isn’t so much an ode, but more of an investigation.  However, it does catch interest.
# The style and tone are spot on.  For the topic, which is not very serious, the laid back humorous style seems to fit in very well. 
DEVELOPMENT
# This paper certainly has plenty of personality.  The author has a nice balance of humor and information.  However, I find myself getting lost in the middle.  Perhaps if the author were to repeat a question at the beginning of each paragraph, the reader could be remembered of what the thesis is.
# The conclusion is funny, but I don't think it really does its job; I find the last sentence especially confusing and unconnected.  Perhaps the author could keep what he/she has, but add in some more review of all the information that is covered.
CONVENTIONS
# The conventions seem to be ok. BUT WHERE ARE THE CITATIONS??? The author needs to develop ethos by sharing where her/his information came from regarding jalapenos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Exposition Writing?==
Exposition can be either oral or written.  It is used to explain, interpret, inform, or describe. An expository writer must assume that the audience has no prior knowledge regarding the topic being discussed.  So the topic must be written in a clear manner explaining how things work (you can however, leave out ''common knowledge''--you probably are not writing for first graders).  

As most academic terms, exposition can acquire various definitions depending on the context in which a writer is using the word. The HarperCollins Collins English Dictionary defines exposition in seven different disciplinary contexts. 

1.	Within the Communication Arts / Journalism &amp; Publishing discipline exposition is defined as: a systematic, usually written statement about,  commentary on, or explanation of a specific subject

2.	The act of expounding of setting forth information or a viewpoint

3.	(Business / Commerce) of a large public exhibition, especially of industrial products or arts and crafts

4.	The act of exposing or the state of being exposed

5.	(Performing Arts / Theatre) the part of a play, novel, etc., in which the theme and main characters are introduced.

6.	(Music / Classical Music) Music the first statement of the subjects or themes of a movement in sonata form or a fugue

7.	(Christianity / Roman Catholic Church) RC Church the exhibiting of the consecrated Eucharistic Host or a relic for public veneration  (Harper Collins Dictionary)

 

===Types of Exposition===
* Description - The author explains a particular topic by showing characteristics, features, and examples.
* Comparison - The author shows how two or more topics are alike. 
* Contrast - The author shows how two or more topics are different.
* Cause and Effect - The author demonstrates the cause while showing the effects of the cause.
* Problem and Solution - The author explains a problem, then explores possible solutions.
* Analytical - The author evaluates a topic or argument revealing its strengths and weaknesses. 
* Classification - The author sorts things into useful categories, makes sure all the categories follow a single organizing principle, and gives examples that fit into each category. 
* Sequence - The author lists items or events in numerical or chronological order.

===Where Do I Begin?===

====Find a Topic and Research====
First you must find a specific aspect of a topic that would interest you. You will have to research the topic extensively so that you can explain it—what exposition is all about. Research your topic extensively.  You will probably have to spend quite a bit of time, but remember that the researching can be exciting.  The general initial researching may even provide some valuable information that you want to explain. Researching is like exercising:  at first it hurts, but with time you become stronger and it's easier to flex your researching muscles. After you have decided upon a topic, you can create a thesis. 

=====Thesis=====
An expositional paper is most easily written when you have a &quot;tight&quot; thesis. This means that the focus of your topic is extremely specific. When your thesis is concise, you can write at length because you know exactly what you should be writing about. But when you have a sloppy, vague thesis, you can become lost and your writing reflects this. This goes back to choosing a topic focus that deals with something specific, and not overly general. A thesis makes a claim regarding your focus and is supported by details and facts. It is written in one or two complete sentences. An example of a thesis would be: “Gardening can be a rewarding hobby because of the creativity involved, the variety of plants, and the many uses of plants.”

====Create a Sketchy Outline====
After you write your thesis, create a sketchy outline so that you have a game plan for your paper.  Your outline should have information that you want to include for each part of your thesis.  For our thesis example, we could find lots of information that could support the different parts of gardening.  Notice the word ''could''--just because we have the information doesn't mean we must use it in the paper.  This is a rough outline after all.

====Start Writing====
Too often we don’t begin writing because we are stuck—don’t be, just start writing. You can begin anywhere.  Start writing where you feel the most comfortable. When you have your outline, as sketchy as it may be, it reminds you of ideas that you want to include in your paper.  Remember though that readers are interested in what YOU have to say—they don’t want to read regurgitated quotes and opinions of others, so make sure that your point is being heard.

==Structure==
The structure of an expository piece consists of first an introduction that contains the most crucial element—the thesis—the main point you wish to convey.  After the introduction is the body, in which you clarify the different aspects of the thesis in great detail.  The final piece, the conclusion, restates and rephrases (using different words) the thesis  and ties up any “loose ends”.  

===Introduction===
The very first part of your introduction should have an attention-grabbing device (a hook) to engage your readers.  Hooks can be statistics, facts, questions, or unusual details. Don't make general statements such as &quot;it is clear that...&quot; because you are trying to explain something that perhaps your reader doesn't know, so it would not be clear to them.  Instead be informative.  The introduction will also contain your thesis.
Good topic referring to Rhetoric. One can check it at the essays writing companies and already written essays accomplished by writing service writers.

===Body===
Now that you have your specific thesis, along with your sketchy outline, you must support your thesis claim by using concrete evidence and examples.  You should exfoliate your thesis.  Remember that expositional writing assumes that your readers have no prior knowledge regarding your topic, so you must explain things very clearly.  Parallelism can be very important in your paper.  It can give the readers a feeling of structure and importance.  Pick a method of organization and stick with it.

In our example, we would explain in detail how much creativity is involved in gardening.  We could write about the style of impressive European or Oriental gardens.  Next, we would show how there are a variety of plants.  We could write about plants found in different climates.  Finally, we would explain the many uses of plants.  We could write about floral bouquets and vegetables.  

Because exposition’s purpose is to inform, you will want to establish common ground with your readers.  You should write objectively, which will fulfill the purpose of explaining things.

===Conclusion===
A conclusion wraps up your paper by recalling your main points, but do not use the identical words that you used in your introduction.  Conclusions and introductions are like frames, they should tie your whole paper together. You should explain your main points briefly and freshly.  
Don't be sloppy--this is the last impression you are making.

==Sample Exposition Assignments==
Here are some sample assignments to prepare you for a real exposition paper or essay.  Remember that your audience has very little previous knowledge of your topic!

{{Sample

==Sample Exposition Essay==
Assignment:  Explain an aspect of cellular phones.  

{{Sample
|sampletext=
&quot;Words are, of course, the most powerful drug used by mankind.&quot; - one of the best ways to spread this &quot;powerful drug&quot; is through the simple act of talking to another person. Everybody wants to talk and everybody also wants to listen and learn. How is one man or woman supposed to communicate with another from across the city, state, or even country without a very powerful tool? This powerful tool, while seemingly simple, is called a cellular phone, or cell phone for short. The cell phone has revolutionized the way that the world communicates with each other and spreads the good word. One might be asking just what a cell phone is--well, listen up and find out.
The cell phone has its roots with the telegraph and telephone. These are both devices that are able to send messages through land-based wires called phone lines. That means that a coded message or a voice is sent through phone lines in order to make it to its destination. The receiving person can then translate the code or listen to the voice on the other end. On a telephone, people were capable of having a conversation from across the nation while it sounded like they were in the same room as each other. In order for them to be able to make a call to each other, though, there would have to be a web of phone lines connecting them over thousands of miles of land. Laying all of these phone lines was very cumbersome, as was only being able to send or receive calls from a stationary place, like a house or office. While the Telephone made broad communication more accessible, it still did not have entirely enough freedom for the people.
This was all changed in the year 1973. A man named Martin Cooper invented the first Cellular Phone while working for Motorola. It was about the size of a brick and weighed over 30 ounces (or 1.8 pounds). While big in size, it was even larger in potential. Cooper made his first call on his cell phone while walking in the middle of a New York street. There were no wires connected to his phone. There was nothing restricting his movement and could send or receive calls from anywhere.
How does a cell phone work if it is not connected to the phone lines? The short answer to that question is: satellites. The cell phone emits a signal to one of the many satellites that are orbiting Earth. The satellite catches the signal and sends it back to Earth to the person that was meant to receive it. This does not mean that cell phones cannot communicate with land-line telephones. If a cell phone calls a land-line, the signal is sent to the satellite and then back to a satellite dish on Earth where it is then re-sent through landlines to the house or office. This also works in reverse for a land-line that is calling a cell phone.
The cell phone is much more than just a unwired phone in the present day. It has evolved much since Cooper's phone of '73 and they now weigh an average of 3 ounces. Cell phones can now store all of the phone numbers that a person needs. There is no more having to find the list of phone numbers on a piece of paper and to dial the number every time a call is placed to somebody. With cell phones, one simply just has to find a person's name on the phone and press send. They can even store schedules, set sleep alarms, take pictures, play music, browse the Internet, and much more.
The cell phone has come a long way in 30 years to set a world free of wires. There is nothing holding anybody back from walking down the middle of the street while having a conversation with somebody 2000 miles away anymore. The cell phone is a marvel beyond what was imagined when Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone. It is a very powerful tool for getting our words around, and will take us places in the future that we have never dreamed of.

|caption=Sample Exposition Essay}}

===Why Is This Good?===
First the introduction, a surprising and interesting quote, immediately catches your attention since it equalizes words and drugs.  The introduction has a tight thesis, “The cell phone has revolutionized the way that the world communicates with each other and spreads the good word.”  

The body explains the revolution of cell phones.  Notice how the writer clearly defined what a phone line is and how it works.  The writer transitions into another topic by asking a question, “How does a cell phone work if it is not connected to the phone lines?”  Asking questions is an easy rhetorical device that can make your paper flow more smoothly.  

Finally, this conclusion ties together the paper since it recalls the main themes.  By using different words, the conclusion is fresh and not predictable.  It is future looking. “It is a very powerful tool for getting our words around, and it will take us places in the future that we have never dreamed of.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Narration?==
Narration may serve a variety of purposes in writing. It may serve as the primary mode in a narrative. Narration may also be used just like reasons and examples to support a thesis, based on either fact or invention. Often, it is used to increase reader interest or dramatize a point the writer wants to make. For example, Aesop wrote fables for his clients to use in their legal defense. They were short, easy to remember, and illustrated the client’s argument. Traditionally, narration was used to recount the facts of a legal case, in order to put them into context and structure them in the best possible light for the speaker’s purpose. Plutarch used narration as the basis for his comparison of Greek and Roman notables. In his 1989 history of the Civil War, ''Battle Cry of Freedom'', James MacPherson uses narration to support the theme of the contingency of history. In short, narration has been used as proof for a long time.

==What is Narrative?==
A narrative is a constructive format (as a work of speech, writing, song, film, television, video games, photography or theatre) that describes a sequence of non-fictional or fictional events. The word derives from the Latin verb narrare, &quot;to tell&quot;, and is related to the adjective gnarus, &quot;knowing&quot; or &quot;skilled&quot;. [Oxford English Dictionary Online, &quot;narrate, v.&quot;. Oxford University Press, 2007]

*First Person Narrative:  A mode of narration where a story is told by one character at a time, speaking from their own perspective only. &quot;I&quot; &quot;My&quot; 

*Second Person Narrative:  A mode of narration where a story is told with the use of &quot;You&quot; &quot;Your&quot;   EXAMPLE:  You went to the store before you bought yourself a flower.

*Third Person Narrative:  A mode of narration where a story is told with the use of &quot;She&quot;  &quot;He&quot;  &quot;They&quot;  &quot;They'll&quot;

*Multiple Narratives:  A mode of narration where a story is told with the use of several narrators which tell the story from different points of view.  The task, for readers, is to decide which narrator     seems the most reliable for each part of the story.  

*Unreliable Narratives:  An unreliable narrator is a narrator whose credibility is in question or has been compromised.  This narrative mode is one which is developed by an author for various reasons, but is usually done so as to deceive the reader or audience.  In most circumstances, unreliable narrators are first-person narrators, but third-person narrators can also be unreliable.

== Elements ==
The minimum requirements of narration include: 
* A beginning, middle, and end
* A main character, perhaps others as well
* A setting in time and place
* Motivated (or caused) action
* Supports the thesis (&quot;It is best to prepare for the days of necessity.&quot;)
[http://www.bartleby.com/17/1/36.html &quot;The Ant and the Grasshopper&quot;]. One example of narration requirements - Aesop's Fables

== Classical Arrangement ==
The classical arrangement indicates how narration may be used: 
* Introduction
* Narrative
* Proposition (thesis)
* Confirmation (more examples, reasons, or narration)
* Refutation (of competing explanations)
* Conclusion&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

== Modern Practice ==
Today, writers commonly begin their essay with a short narrative which leads to the thesis:

* Short Narrative
* Thesis
* Supporting examples and reasons
* Opposing viewpoints
* Conclusion

Or, they may use narration to support their argument:

* Introduction
* Thesis
* Supporting examples and reasons
* Narrative
* Conclusion

Many organizational methods exist for incorporating narration into writing. In the end, it will depend on your purpose and audience as to how and where (and even &quot;if&quot;) you use it.

* [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/t/thoreau/henry_david/walden/chapter12.html &quot;Walden, Chapter 12&quot;]

== Student Essay ==
Below is a description of the process one might go through to write an essay supporting the thesis with narration.

Answer the following questions:

* What is the purpose of your essay? What point do you want to make?
* What specific statement (thesis) do you want your story to support?
* What audience do you wish to address? Your professor? Your classmates? Some fictional audience? This will determine how formal or informal you can be, what assumptions you have of what your audience knows and likes.
* What is your setting, in time and place? Or, where and when does the story take place?
* Which events best illustrate your purpose in telling the story? Which events are clear in your mind, and will be most easily related? What is the best order to relate the events? Treat this question like a brainstorming process, and list as many events as you can remember. Then narrow your list to the most pertinent to your thesis statement and inherent purpose.

In our example essay, the writer may start with the events of his freshman year, going all the way through to his senior year.


{{SAMPLE|sampletext= 
*Freshman: 
**I learned to manage my time with practice, schoolwork, and my social life.
**I learned what it means to earn your status within a group atmosphere.

*Sophomore:
**I learned to deal with adversity, as I was injured throughout most of the season.
**I learned to ask for and rely on the help of others when I could not do things on my own.

*Junior: 
**I learned to truly work together to achieve team goals, as we had a very successful season.
**I learned to present myself as a role model, as I gained some community notoriety.

*Senior:
**I learned how to present myself as a true leader of a group, as I was elected team captain.
**I learned to take pride in everything I do because it is the most rewarding.|caption=Events of the Narrative}}


Once you have stated the purpose of your essay, formulated a thesis, selected an audience, identified a setting, and brainstormed the events of your story, it is time to begin writing.  Keep in mind that the more detail and description you can fit into your essay, the more the story will come alive for the reader.  Also, your conclusion should relate how the events in the story changed you as a person with regard to your purpose.

AGLUYA, CRESCINTI
BSA-1-C

My experience playing High School basketball taught me skills which will benefit me throughout 
the rest of my life.  It all started during the fall of my freshman year at Otucan Bila National High School, when I quickly found out how important time management is.  I had my schoolwork, 
which was fourteen credits including an extremely difficult Mathematics class.  I had basketball, 
which included meetings and practice every day and running and lifting a couple times of week.  
I also had my social life, another important aspect, especially to a twelve year old.  

My sophomore year taught me how to deal with adversity.  I broke my leg during the second game 
of the season against Team Angels, and I learned how something that seems devastating can be 
seen in a positive light.  I learned that life will always have something unexpected in store, 
but learning to deal with it makes us stronger people.

My junior year taught me how to set goals and achieve them in a team atmosphere.  Our team that year had a mission to make the playoffs, and we were not going to let anything get in our way. We really came together that year because we all had a common goal.  I learned that a group can achieve wonderful things if all of the group members work together and believe in each other.

My senior year in basketball taught me how to be a leader.  I was elected team captain by my 
teammates, which showed me that my peers respected me and knew they could rely on me. 
Leadership does not come easily however.  I learned that leadership must not only be earned,
but it also must be kept.  I was always conscious of the way I acted and spoke, because I knew
my teammates were looking to me for strength.

Each year I played High School basketball taught me something not only about myself but also about the nature of the world and the people who inhabit the world.  I learned how to balance my time, deal with adversity, the true meaning of teamwork, and how to be a respected leader. 
These skill-building activities will benefit me throughout the rest of my life.|caption=Sample Narrative}}

== Revision Hints ==

As with any form of essay, it is always important to go back and revise the first draft.  Proofread the essay carefully, and look for ways to improve its overall appearance.  In the case of narration, make sure the story flows for the audience.  Do the events of the story make sense?  Also, look to make sure that each event relates directly back to the purpose and thesis.  Does this particular event reinforce my thesis?  When writing a narration, it is also important to look for ways to make the story more vivid for the audience.  Go back and include as many descriptive words and details as possible.  Once you are satisfied with your product, make a clean and neat final copy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Evaluative Writing?==
Evaluative writing is a type of writing intended to judge something according to a set of criteria. For instance, your health might be evaluated by an insurance company before issuing a policy. The purpose of this evaluation would be to determine your overall health and to check for existing medical conditions. The better your evaluation, the less the insurance company might charge you for coverage.  

===Criteria===
The key to effective evaluative writing is starting off with a clear and precise argument.  Your main argument is what you will use to perform the evaluation. You may want to argue that a Chevy Tahoe is better than a Ford Expedition based on its horsepower, gas mileage, capacity, warranty, etc. Other evaluators might argue the difference between their towing capability. Whatever the main argument may be for your evaluative essay, make sure that your argument is clear.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
* Make sure you have a well presented subject.  Without one, you will lose your readers.  
* Create a thesis statement.  Thesis statements help you stay focused and help your reader to understand what is being evaluated or judged.
* Give only information that is imperative to the decision making process.  If it looks like unnecessary information, it probably is.
* Do not be biased when creating an evaluative essay.  Give both good and bad examples of the topic.  
* You are the &quot;expert&quot; in an evaluative essay. Support your opinions with facts, not whims.

===How to Evaluate===
A big question you might have is: how do I evaluate my subject?  That depends on what your subject is.  

If you are evaluating a piece of writing, then you are going to need to read the work thoroughly.  While you read the work, keep in mind the criteria you are using to evaluate.  The evaluative aspects may be: grammar, sentence structure, spelling, content, usage of sources, style, or many other things.  Another thing to consider when evaluating a piece of writing is whether the writing appeals to its target audience.  Is there an emotional appeal?  Does the author engage the audience, or is the piece lacking something?  If you can, make notes directly on your work itself so that you remember what you want to write about in your essay.

If you are evaluating anything else, use your head.  You '''need''' to try, use, or test whatever thing you are evaluating.  That means you should not evaluate a 2005 Chevrolet Corvette unless you have the $45,000 (or more) to buy one, or the money to rent one.  You also need the know-how of driving a car of that power and a base of knowledge of other cars that you have tested to make a fair comparison.  

On the note of comparisons, '''only compare things that are reasonably alike'''.  People don't care to know how an apple compares to a backpack; that is for a different type of essay.  Compare different types of apples to each other and different types of backpacks against each other.  That is what people are looking for when reading comparisons in an evaluation essay.

Whatever you are evaluating, make sure to do so thoroughly.  Take plenty of notes during the testing phase so that your thoughts stay fresh in your mind.  You do not want to forget about a part of the subject that you did not test.

==Structure of the Essay==
===Introduction===

In the introduction of your evaluative essay, you should clearly state the following:
- what you are evaluating (the subject -- like a 2009 Toyota Prius)
- the purpose of your evaluation
- what criteria you are evaluating your subject on (mileage, price, performance, etc.)

For example, you should not just write that you are judging the taste of an apple.  You should explain that you are judging the sweetness, bitterness, and crispness of the apple.

===Body===
Unlike some types of essays, the introduction is '''not''' the most important part of an evaluative essay.  Most readers already want to read about the subject that you are writing on, so you don't need to draw them in with a fancy intro.  Your audience just wants the information!  

Be sure to be very descriptive and thorough when evaluating your subject.  The more you leave out of the essay, the more unanswered questions your readers are left with.  Your goal should be to cover all aspects of the subject and to tell the audience how good or bad it is. Consider, for example, not only what quality the subject possesses, but what is missing. Good evaluations measure the quality or value of a subject by considering what it has and what it lacks.

===Conclusion===
The conclusion for an evaluative essay is pretty straightforward.  Simply go over the main points from the body of your essay.  After that, make an overall evaluation of the subject.  Tell the audience if they should buy it, eat it, use it, wear it, etc. and why.  After that is done, your essay is over. Good job!

==Sample Assignments==
Here are some sample assignments to get your brain pumping:

*Evaluate the plans for a new Minnesota Twins ballpark (found here: [http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/min/ballpark/index.jsp New Ballpark Plans]).  How does it compare to the current Metrodome in Minneapolis in terms of seating, concessions, cost to build, etc.?  In the end, is it a good idea to build their proposed park?

*Evaluate your backpack.  Test its durability, comfort level, ease-of-use, storage capacity, fabric quality, manufacturing quality, etc.  Compare it with one or more of your former backpacks and/or one of your friend's backpacks.  Also, compare it to a different type of backpack (example: duffle bag VS. two-strap backpack).  Take notes on each backpack and rate them against each other.  Is your backpack the better one?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview of Plagiarism ==
According to ''dictionary.com'', plagiarism is defined as the act of passing off as one's own the ideas or writings of another.  

The Council of Writing Program Administrators' definition for plagiarism: In an instructional setting, plagiarism occurs when a writer deliberately uses someone else's language, ideas, or other original (not commonly-knowledge) material without acknowledging its source.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan, Richard and Charles Paine. Writing Today. Custom Edition for St. Cloud State University. Boston: Pearson Education, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three conventions in writing for situations where you must provide reference.
* When you use someone else's ideas, such as the above definitions of plagiarism, cite them.
* When the way in which you are using a source is unclear to the reader, make it clear.
* Acknowledge any help you receive from someone on writing the paper.

Citing your sources is easy; do it and save yourself from getting in a lot of trouble.

== Examples of Plagiarism ==
The following is adapted from Diana Hacker's ''A Pocket Style Manual.''&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Diana. ''A Pocket Style Manual.'' New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2004. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 

:''Your research paper is a collaboration between you and your sources.  To be fair and ethical, you must acknowledge your debt to the writers of those sources.  If you don't, you are guilty of plagiarism, a serious academic offense.  Three different acts are considered plagiarism:'' 
:* ''failing to cite quotations and borrowed ideas,''
:* ''failing to enclose borrowed language in quotation marks, and''
:* ''failing to put summaries and paraphrases in your own words.''

If you wrote something in your paper such as this:

:''When writing a research paper it is important to acknowledge your debt to the writers of those sources.  It is a collaboration between you and your sources.  Failure to not acknowledge your sources is an act of plagiarism.''

and did not put any reference to Hacker, it would be plagiarism.  A proper way to use the work would be this:

:''Diana Hacker stresses how important it is &quot;to acknowledge your debt to the writers&quot; of sources you use in your writing.  She states that your paper &quot;is a collaboration between you and your sources&quot;.  &quot;failure to not acknowledge your sources is an act of plagiarism&quot; (Hacker 115).''

It is also important to not only cite your sources in your work but also include a detailed reference to the work at the end of your paper on the works cited page.  An example for the previous source is below:

:Hacker, Diana. &lt;u&gt;A Pocket Style Manual&lt;/u&gt;. New York: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2004.

== Rules to Help You Avoid Plagiarism ==

The following rules are taken from Rosen, Leonard. ''The Academic Writer's Handbook: Instructor's Copy.'' 2006, pages 122–124.

* When quoting another writer, use quotation marks and give credit.
* When restating the ideas of others in your words, give credit.
* Avoid using words, phrases, or sentence structures from the original source.

[[Category:Rhetoric and Composition]]

== Patchwriting == 
&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Sheehan, Richard and Charles Paine. Custom Ediction for St. Cloud State University. Boston: Pearson Education, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patchwriting means taking another person's words and sentences and reworking them, changing words or phrases here and there, to make it appear that the writing is your own. Patchwriting is academically dishonest and should not be done. Sometimes, students patchwrite even if they don't mean to. But whether it was intentional or not, the offense is still an offense. It's important to summarize and paraphrase carefully to avoid patchwriting and plagiarism. A paraphrase uses parallel keywords to restate both the implicit and explicit claims and evidence of the author. Writers need to include citations with paraphrases because the information in the paraphrase is not the writer’s original thought.

&lt;/div&gt;

Any time you use in your paper information that you paraphrase, summarize, or quote from another source, you must give the author or the publication proper credit. Failure to do so is considered [[../Plagiarism|plagiarism]].

Plagiarism can be avoided by using '''parenthetical citations''' alias '''in-text citations''' within the text of your paper or essay and  by using a '''bibliography''' (a list of your sources) at the end of your paper or essay.
{{todo|Are parenthetical citations the same as in-text citations? Is &quot;[1]&quot; and &quot;[BEQ78]&quot; a parenthetical citation or only an in-text citation? That should be clarified.}}

The specific details of how to cite sources are prescribed in various citation styles. One of the most common writing systems in the educational systems is The Modern Language Association (MLA) style of writing. Most students learn first how to write using the MLA format in elementary school. Another very common writing system frequently used by the social sciences is the American Psychological Association (APA) format.

In MLA the bibliography is titled &quot;Works Cited,&quot; and in APA the list is titled &quot;References.&quot;

== Citing Outside Sources In-Text ==

Your in-text citations should correspond to the first item listed in your bibliographic citations, which is usually the author's last name. For example, if the in-text citation looks like this: 
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=In a 1949 visit to members of Congress, Hemingway repeatedly reported of the natural beauty that would be destroyed by exploring for oil in Alaska (Booth 216).|caption=Example of an MLA parenthetical citation.}}
Then by going to the bibliography page and looking down the list of sources, the name &quot;Booth&quot; should start the citation. For example, &lt;br&gt;{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&lt;center&gt;Works Cited&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Booth, Fredrick. &lt;u&gt;The Effect of Hemingway on Alaska&lt;/u&gt;. Hartford: 
---. Wilmington UP, 1998.&lt;br&gt;|caption=Example from MLA Works Cited page.}}

=== Parenthetical Citations ===

Parenthetical Citations serve to inform your reader of where you found the data or quotation you are providing to them.  Generally, in MLA, if you are citing more than one source, you should include the author's or editor's name and the page number in your parenthetical citation. For example: (Jones 127). If you are only using a single source which is already identified elsewhere in the text, simply use the page number.

==== MLA Examples ====

MLA Parenthetical (or In-Text) Citation Examples:

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=Hemingway's arguments against oil drilling in Alaska continued to intensify in his later life. In a 1949 visit to members of Congress, Hemingway repeatedly reported of the natural beauty that would be destroyed by exploring for oil in Alaska (Booth 216).  Later that year, Hemingway went on to request, and to be granted, an audience with the President where he shared a multitude of research against drilling (Goodview 98).  Hemingway, along with countless other supporters, continued to call upon legislators from both sides of the aisle until the idea of Alaskan oil exploration was naught, or so they thought.  &quot;It is a victory for all the inhabitants of the earth that the State of Alaska's natural beauty, wonder, and habitat will remain unharmed by human greed so that our children and grandchildren and generations after them will be able to catch a glimpse of an unspoiled planet&quot; (Chandler 143).  The idea of an unspoiled planet was, unfortunately, relatively short lived.
|caption=An example of MLA parenthetical citations.}}

You may also mention the author's name within the text rather than in a parenthetical citation.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=Hemingway's arguments against oil drilling in Alaska continued to intensify in his later life. According to Booth, in a 1949 visit to members of Congress, Hemingway repeatedly reported of the natural beauty that would be destroyed by exploring for oil in Alaska (216).  Goodview reports that later that year Hemingway went on to request, and to be granted, an audience with the President where he shared a multitude of research against drilling (98).
|caption=An example of MLA parenthetical citations.}}

If a source has two to three authors, mention all the names within the text, or in a parenthetical citation, separated by &quot;and.&quot;

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=Hemingway's arguments against oil drilling in Alaska continued to intensify in his later life. According to Booth and Goodview, in a 1949 visit to members of Congress, Hemingway repeatedly reported of the natural beauty that would be destroyed by exploring for oil in Alaska (216).

|caption=An example of MLA parenthetical citations.}}

If your source has four or more authors, you may mention only the first author's last name followed by &quot;et al.,&quot; or you may use all the author's last names.

==== APA Examples ====

APA Parenthetical (or In-Text) Citation Examples:

In APA format, you also include the author's name in parenthetical citations; however, whenever you use the author's name in APA, you '''must''' also include the '''date''' of the publication.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=Hemingway's arguments against oil drilling in Alaska continued to intensify in his later life. In a 1949 visit to members of Congress, Hemingway repeatedly reported of the natural beauty that would be destroyed by exploring for oil in Alaska (Booth, 2000, p. 216).  Later that year, Hemingway went on to request, and to be granted, an audience with the President where he shared a multitude of research against drilling (Goodview, 1998, p. 98).  Hemingway, along with countless other supporters, continued to call upon legislators from both sides of the aisle until the idea of Alaskan oil exploration was naught, or so they thought.  &quot;It is a victory for all the inhabitants of the earth that the State of Alaska's natural beauty, wonder, and habitat will remain unharmed by human greed so that our children and grandchildren and generations after them will be able to catch a glimpse of an unspoiled planet&quot; (Chandler, 1985, p. 143).  The idea of an unspoiled planet was, unfortunately, relatively short lived.
|caption=An example of APA parenthetical citations.}}

You may also mention the author's name within the text.

In a 1949 visit to members of Congress, Hemingway repeatedly reported of the natural beauty that would be destroyed by exploring for oil in Alaska (p. 216). Goodview (1998) notes that Later that year Hemingway went on to request, and to be granted, an audience with the President where he shared a multitude of research against drilling (p. 98).  Hemingway, along with countless other supporters, continued to call upon legislators from both sides of the aisle until the idea of Alaskan oil exploration was naught, or so they thought.  One of these members is quoted by Chandler (1998) as saying of this time, &quot;It is a victory for all the inhabitants of the earth that the State of Alaska's natural beauty, wonder, and habitat will remain unharmed by human greed so that our children and grandchildren and generations after them will be able to catch a glimpse of an unspoiled planet&quot; (p. 143).

|caption=An example of APA parenthetical citations.}}

If you need to cite two authors of the same work who are mentioned within the text, use both their last names and separate it with &quot;and.&quot;

{{SAMPLE|sampletext= According to Chandler and Goodview (2004), Hemingway's arguments against oil drilling in Alaska continued to intensify in his later life. In a 1949 visit to members of Congress, Hemingway repeatedly reported of the natural beauty that would be destroyed by exploring for oil in Alaska (p. 216).|caption=An example of APA parenthetical citations.}}

If you do not mention the two author's names within the text, you do so in parenthesis using an ampersand instead of the word &quot;and.&quot;

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=Hemingway's arguments against oil drilling in Alaska continued to intensify in his later life. In a 1949 visit to members of Congress, Hemingway repeatedly reported of the natural beauty that would be destroyed by exploring for oil in Alaska (Chandler &amp; Goodview, 2004, p. 216).|caption=An example of APA parenthetical citations.}}

If you have three to five authors, list them all by last name the '''first''' time you mention them in the text. Thereafter, only use the first author's last name followed by &quot;et al.&quot;

If you do not know the author's name, use a portion of the article or book title instead. Titles of articles are placed within quotes. Book and report titles are italicized or underlined. (Note that in APA only the first word of an article title is capitalized.)

== Citing Outside Sources in a Bibliography ==

While parenthetical in-text citations already indicate the sources of the information, a full identification of the cited sources is required to make it possible for the reader to unambiguously locate the source in a library or on the internet. The list of fully identified sources usually goes at the end of your paper, into a bibliography section. A full identification of a source usually includes the year of publication, the authors, the title of the work, the publishing organization, and more. The information included in the full identification of a source varies with the publication style such as MLA style and APA style.

== Introduction ==

Writing in the sciences fulfills one of two purposes:  
# Inform the reader of new discoveries  
# Assist the reader in clarifying the truth using new facts or perspectives  

'''A comparison''': While writing in the humanities is used to explore the human condition, writing in the sciences is used to examine nature, human experience, and/or technology.

This leads to the two major types of papers written in the sciences: 
# Lab report 
# Literature review

Writing in the sciences requires elements not necessarily needed when writing in the humanities. It requires data, evidence, facts, and precision, which in turn require intimate attention to detail. The goal of writing in the sciences is to clearly present what you have discovered or what you did. This generally requires the writing to be done in the past tense. The language used should allow no room for interpretation by the reader. The nature and subject matter of the ideas in your paper must be presented in a factual style, leaving out figurative or emotional language.

Besides lab reports and literature reviews, writing in the sciences also includes reviews for a peer or textbook, or grant proposals and equipment or facility requests. It is easy to get caught up using jargon and highly technical language. While this language may be appropriate in certain cases, you should know your audience and avoid using words they will not understand (also including definitions where appropriate).

Space occasionally becomes an issue when writing in the sciences. For example, grant proposal applications and abstracts require the text to be limited to a short paragraph. Therefore, an indispensable tool for the scientific paper is the ability to summarize quickly and get to the point. An example grant proposal may include the following sentences:

&quot;Our preliminary research shows a high probability of success if allowed to develop. This requires us to find additional monetary help, as well as a facility to use long term. We are asking for your company's help.&quot;

Although you may include a few facts or numbers to back up your claim of success, this is the general format for such a request.

There are basic tips to keep in mind while writing your scientific paper. 
* Be detailed
* Remain focused on your topic
* Leave figurative language out
* Be precise 
* Define jargon based on assumed audience knowledge

There are two categories of sciences writing; '''social sciences''' and '''natural sciences'''.

== Social Sciences ==

When writing in the social sciences, the writer will spend less time in the library researching data, and a majority of time documenting actual events.  Writing in the social sciences is the study of human behavior, the value systems of people, and the interactions between people, whether in the family unit or simply in a group setting.

Writing in this discipline can be a very challenging experience.  Gathering the data and interpreting the information can be tedious.  Interviews are conducted, and attitudes must be examined and recorded.  But recording data gathered from studying human beings is difficult because the human mind is an ever-changing thing.

One key element to writing a paper in the social sciences is the art of taking a stand.  Choose your topic, make your claim, provide evidence to support your claim, and finally, convince your reader that your claim is the one with which to side.  Take a hard look at both sides of the issue you intend on addressing.  Doing so will prepare you to defend arguments in opposition to your viewpoint.  Because issues in the social sciences are subjective, the writer should expect some degree of opposing opinions and even, possibly, some controversy.  This is why it is suggested that when you write a social sciences paper you choose a topic that you either possess first hand knowledge, know a great deal of information on, or simply a topic about which you are passionate.

Charts and graphs are common elements included in the social sciences paper.  A valuable source of information for the social scientist is a government document.  These documents contain the most up-to-date information in a variety of fields.

Writing in the social sciences uses a technical vocabulary.

Social sciences attempt to study and describe human behavior and societies.  The social sciences can be broken down into further into the following categories:

=== Psychology ===

The case study is one of the main writing choices in psychology. These are often studies of a patient seeking help through psychotherapy. These types of case studies can generally be divided into five sections:

:1. Background Information
::This section describes the person based on information a therapist would get from the person during an intake interview. This would include, but is not limited to: demographic information, family history, and history of symptoms.

The following three sections will consider how a person would react to three general categories of psychotherapy. In each section, the following questions should be answered:
:::*What is the therapy like?
:::*What does the person talk about or do in that therapy?
:::*What is the therapist's role?
:::*How would this person react to that therapist role?
:::*Would the person benefit from this therapy? Why or why not?

:2. Psychoanalytic Therapy
::This type of treatment could be a traditional or contemporary style of psychoanalysis. In other words, the typical patient laying on a couch and talking about his or her feelings, or a more contemporary approach of question and answer, or another setting in which the patient feels more comfortable. A form of psycho-dynamic therapy (changing up the environment for the patient) could also be used.

:3. Behavioral Therapy
:: This could be a form of behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, or a mixture of both.

:4. Humanistic Therapy
:: This could be existential therapy, gestalt therapy, Zen therapy, or whatever style seems to fit the patient. This is a very progressive form of psychotherapy.

:5. Conclusion
:: This section should draw an overall conclusion of how the person in question would react to each kind of considered therapy. The patient's feelings do need to be taken into account when recommending the best treatment, as no one can be helped when they do not want to be. A final recommendation is made, and the case study is usually reviewed by colleagues, or a board or some kind, to comment and recommend a course of action to the psychologist.

Places you may want to look for current information include psychology encyclopedias and abstracts and mental health journals.  

(Further resources to consider follow at the end of this section.)

=== Anthropology ===

Presenting a case study is a common form of presenting the anthropology paper.  The writer is looking at and analyzing the past.

There are specific guidelines to follow when writing an anthropology paper.  Stick to the facts and document these thoroughly in the reference list.  Quotations are important, but not as important as data.

Because anthropology is such a specialized field, be sure that you re-read your paper several times to be sure that it is comprehensible to a person who may not be a specialist in the field.  In other words, can your average college student understand what you are talking about?  The trick here is to find a balance in this paper; it must be scholarly, yet understandable.

=== Political Science ===

Writing case studies is the main type of writing in this discipline.  When writing a paper in political science, you will probably be analyzing how different political organizations function, both individually and as a group.  While many of the other categories of the social sciences involve directly observing the group dynamics, writing a paper for political science involves indirect observation.  You will pick one specific behavior to observe and focus your paper on that chosen behavior.

Writing for political science can include any level of the government; city, state or federal.  Places you may want to look for current information include government documents and newspaper articles.  You should expect to be able to support and defend the chosen topic or argument that is the subject of your paper, and do so in a convincing and scholarly manner.  If you accomplish all this, and make it a sound political argument, you have then written a solid political science paper.

=== Sociology ===

Writing a good sociology paper includes a clear thesis statement.  While this is important in all papers requiring a thesis statement, the field of sociology carries with it a potential danger; taking sides.

Writing about sociology is about studying human behavior and the interaction between individuals or groups.  An effective sociology paper will analyze these interactions and remain objective.  The pitfall that many writers fall into when writing a sociology paper is that they take sides, and as a result they will slant their terminology toward one view or another.  This is the trick to a successful sociology paper; staying on the median.

The case study to be the primary focus in sociology writing.  In this discipline, writing about group dynamics is a key element.

=== Education ===

Many topics are covered in the education section of the social sciences, including students with special needs and child development.  The instructor may choose to assign a topic for each individual student or the class as a whole.  This gives the group the opportunity to work together and developed a more refined paper.  The case study is a common type of paper chosen for a group assignment.  Other times, the education instructor may allow each student to choose his or her own topic related to the education field.  If that is the case, choose a topic that is of interest to you.  You may not have a lot of knowledge about your chosen topic, but if you are genuinely interested in it, the information will be easy to come by and just as easy to understand.

Some of the possible types of papers you may be required to write include literature reviews, an analysis paper, case studies, research papers and lab papers.  There are many more types of papers to write in this discipline, so be sure to clarify with your instructor what he or she expects.

=== Economics ===

When writing a paper in the economics discipline, the goal is to provide the reader with a clear understanding of the general or specific fields of economics. It also seeks to define the many areas of economics, such as goods, services, and simple the state of economics in our society.

The economics paper may be as simple as a journal review (the Wall Street Journal, for example).  Academic journals will be used often, as will statistical data from government sources.

One important thing to remember when writing in this discipline:  be sure your vocabulary reflects the nature of the subject.  Use topic-specific words and avoid personal observations.  Be as factual as possible, avoiding jumping to unsubstantiated conclusions.

=== Elements of the Social Sciences Paper ===

When it comes down to actually writing your paper, be sure to include the following elements:  an introduction, a thesis statement, the body of the paper, and the conclusion.  Many social scientists use these headings in their paper.

One element of the social science paper that greatly differs from the humanities paper is that it should be written in such a way that the reader can take any section from the paper and read it independently from the rest of the paper, without having to look back at any other section.  It is this type of technical writing that sets the social sciences paper apart from the humanities paper; each section is its own mini-paper.  Knowing your audience members will greatly assist you in writing your social sciences paper.

A social science paper include many elements such as a title page, an abstract, thesis statement, introduction, body, conclusion and bibliography.  

Your '''title page''' should include the subject or title of your paper, your name (and, if required, your address and phone number), and the current date.  Some instructors also require you include the name of the course along with course number.
An ''abstract'' is a short summary of the ideas you will be proposing in your paper.  It is the place to state the argument you intend to address.  You can do so by writing an outline of the background information for the paper.  When writing your abstract, consider what experiments you did and what kinds of interviews you conducted.  The abstract will be set aside from the rest of the paper, usually in the beginning.  It will be the only element of the paper on its own page.  An effective abstract will be able to summarize the paper with anywhere between 100 and 300 words.

The '''thesis statement''' will also come at the beginning of your paper.  It will state the purpose of your argument and will introduce your claim to a specific type of human behavior.  Your thesis is generally a part of your introduction.  Your ''introduction'' will introduce your paper's main ideas.  Keep them succinct, but make them interesting.  Some questions to answer in your introduction may include: Why did you choose this topic?  Is there a need for the general public to know about this issue, and why?  How does this issue affect you, if at all?  Define the problem clearly.  Give examples so the reader knows exactly why this is a problem and how it affects society.  Your instructor may want your introduction to be a separate element of the paper or a part of the body of your paper.

Toward the beginning of the '''body''' of your paper you will put your hypothesis.  If you conducted experiments, what did you think would happen when you first began them?  Working through the body of the paper you should cover the testing of the hypothesis, along with the discussion of any research conducted.  The body of the social sciences paper will include many elements:  the background of the problem or issue you are addressing (which addresses the issue of topic importance), your rationale (which justifies your choice of topics), your statement of qualification (which outlines why you, as a writer, as qualified to write on the subject), a survey of literature (which denotes the sources you used in forming your hypothesis), the methods of research used, the time estimate outline (for completing your experiments/projects), and any information about budget limitations.  The body is where you will include any charts or graphs that will assist you in reporting your information.  Supporting discussion should be written to explain these elements.

In the '''conclusion''' of the social sciences paper, you should recap the information you addressed in the body of the paper, keeping in close contact with the thesis.  Did your test results differ from your hypothesis?  If so, why?  The conclusion should explain how the data supported or did not support your hypothesis.  During your entire conclusion, you should always back up the main theme of your paper.

You will certainly need to include a works cited page ('''bibliography''') to credit any sources used in your paper.  Also, many education research papers include an appendix.  You may include charts, graphs, and definitions.  Most social sciences papers use the APA (American Psychological Association) format for documentation style, however, you will want to discuss style with your instructor before you begin your paper.

=== Resources to Use ===

Different resources you will use in order to complete your social sciences paper will provide different levels of information.  An encyclopedia will provide basic information in pretty general terms.  The information here will be in a the form of a summary, and will not be very comprehensive in nature.  This is where books, a better source for information, will be beneficial.  When you search for one specific book, this search may lead you to several other valuable books that you find you will want to reference in your paper.  Finally, journal articles should be the final source you should rely on for information.  Journal articles will provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date information in the subject you are researching.  This is one of the reasons that it is important to use the journal article as your ''last'' source of information; the journal article is written in such a way that it assumes the reader has prior knowledge on the subject matter.  So read your encyclopedia first (general and summative information), then research your subject in books (dedicated material), and finally in journal articles (comprehensive and scholarly).

In any case, you should steer yourself away from the mainstream media for your information.  Stick with the scholarly print sources.

== Natural Sciences ==

Writing in the natural sciences means writing about the natural aspects of our world. Theories are tested in order to solve problems. The natural sciences paper is used to evaluate and conclude from this testing.

Writing in this discipline is a detailed, tedious process. Specific steps must be taken to ensure you have gathered accurate data. Once you have gathered enough data, you must organize it into a coherent flow of ideas, ending with your evaluation or conclusion. One of the critical parts of the natural sciences paper is the presentation. You have your data, you have organized it, so now it is time to present it in a factual, knowledgeable way.

Natural Sciences can be broken down into 2 categories; '''pure sciences''' and '''applied sciences'''.

Pure Sciences include the life sciences, physical sciences, and earth sciences. Life sciences focuses on how plants, animals, and organisms (living things) relate to each other and how they interact with their surroundings. Biology is one area of the life sciences. Others include ecology, molecular biology and genetics, and food sciences.
 
To write about the physical sciences is to write about matter (anything that occupies space) and energy (what causes matter to move), not living things. There are many topics in the field of physical science. The list includes aerodynamics, thermodynamics, chemistry, and even astronomy.

Earth science, quite simply, is the study of the earth and its history. There are four main areas of earth science:  ''geology'' (the study of the structure of the earth and how it formed), ''meteorology'' (the study of weather), ''oceanography'' (the study of the ocean and the creatures living in it), and ''space science'' (the study of the planets, stars, and everything else out there). Possible earth science topics may include volcanoes, tornadoes, the study of rocks, our atmosphere, earth minerals, or the solar system.

Applied Sciences include medical sciences (i.e. forensics, pharmaceuticals), engineering sciences (i.e. electrical/mechanical engineering) and computer science.

=== Elements of the Natural Sciences Paper ===

Keep in mind that when writing in the sciences, fact is preferred over flair. Write about the facts - the experiment outcomes, the process of information gathering, or a succinct hypothesis. Focus ''on'' the &quot;what&quot; and keep away from ''describing'' the &quot;what.&quot;

It is good pedagogic practice to require student write ups to be near in style to what would be expected in a published paper. There is a tradition in science of using a neutral tone, the third person and the passive voice, and some institutions may require this style for high marks. It can however lead to rather stilted writing and other institutions encourage the use of the 1st person in write ups. It is necessary to be aware of the requirements of the course, the potential audience of the article and perhaps even the personality of the marker.

There are seven steps to writing in the Natural Sciences:

# The problem being addressed must be stated in an objective fashion.
# Unbiased relevant information must be gathered.
# The information gathered must be analyzed.
# A hypothesis is formulated.
# Experimentation (the fun stuff) to prove your hypothesis.  Remember that keeping a journal of experiment outcomes is important for your final steps, so be detailed.
# Analyze your journal notes.
# Arrive at your conclusion, which may or may not prove your original hypothesis.

When it comes down to actually writing your paper, be sure to include the following elements:

; Title : The title of the natural sciences paper is very important. It should be concise and clearly describe what your paper is about. You may choose to introduce what you tested. For example:
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;Synthesis of 2-phenyl-2-butanol via a Grignard Reaction&quot;|caption=Sample title for a natural sciences paper}}
: This title describes the molecule of interest and the reaction of interest, making it easy for the reader to determine if this paper is one they would want to read.

; Abstract : This is a brief description of your paper. Take the main ideas and summarize them in 250 words or less. For example, this is an abstract for a paper written in the organic chemistry field.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext= 
&quot;This experiment synthesized 2-phenyl-2-butanol using a Grignard reagent under reflux conditions. Learning to utilize Grignard reagents is an important skill for any future chemist. After performing the experiment, it has been concluded that there was a moderate to poor yield of 2-phenyl-2-butanol produced. Unwanted oxidization of Magnesium metal during the formation of the Grignard reagent is a possible explanation. However, the characterization of the product using IR spectroscopy and 1H NMR spectroscopy has reinforced the production of a pure product.&quot;|caption=Abstract containing 80 words}}

: There is little to no explanation of the details of the experiment or results. If the reader is interested in this synthesis, they now know that this experiment showed a poor but pure yield, and used both IR and NMR spectroscopy to analyze the product. This is important in scientific writing because of the massive amounts of information available to a researcher. The nature of modern computer searches has meant that the abstract of a ''published'' paper is of paramount importance. There may be a hundred people reading the abstract for every single one who actually ever reads the full paper. Anything useful which the paper contains therefore &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; be mentioned in these 250 words. Abstracts help research scientists to weed through papers to find information pertinent to their specific interest.

; Introduction : The paper should begin by introducing and forming a question in the introduction. The introduction should include relevant theories and equations used in your experiment. If other scientists have conducted similar experiments, give recognition to these predecessors of your work. Any hypotheses you have formed should be stated here. A brief description of the experiments conducted should be outlined in the introduction also, saving the intimate details of the experiments for the body of the paper.

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;The reaction itself was developed by Victor Grignard of France in the late 1800s.  His preparation of magnesium alkyl halides (now referred to as Grignard reagents) was first presented to the Académie des Sciences in France on May 11, 1900. (Nobel Prize.org) The reaction uses Magnesium metal to create an electron rich carbon atom from an alkyl or aryl halide.  This is the Grignard reagent.  The electron rich carbon atom becomes a nucleophile, attacking any other molecule that is electron poor.  If placed in solution with a molecule containing a ketone, the Grignard reagent will attack the ketone carbon, creating a new carbon-carbon bond connected to a negatively charged oxygen atom.  That oxygen is then easily turned into an alcohol using any weak acid. ...
|caption=Sample Introduction Text}}

: This introduction goes into detail regarding the synthesis used and what is synthesized in the experiment. This provides ample background information for the reader who may not be an expert in the experiment performed.

; Thesis Statement : The thesis statement of a scientific paper is a clear and concise statement of your topic of study. This could be included in your introduction.
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;The compound synthesized in this reaction, 2-phenyl-2-butanol, is a chiral molecule.&quot;|caption=Thesis statement for sample paper}}

: This thesis statement clearly defines what is being accomplished (or trying to be accomplished) through this experiment. Notice that this particular example does not include a hypothesis. For a synthesis-type experiment, there may not be any predictions to be made. Not all scientific papers need to include a hypothesis.

; Body 
: Since the goal of the scientific paper is to present facts supported by evidence, there are general rules to follow in the paper. Avoid adjectives and adverbs (being descriptive), and instead focus on the nouns (the focus of the paper) and the verbs (how it acted).
: Structure your sentences so that they are clear and easy to understand. Keep your audience in mind when using technical jargon. Limit yourself to words and jargon that your audience should be familiar with. Overuse of unfamiliar jargon will not make you sound smarter, it will only thoroughly confuse your readers.

:; The body of the paper will include the following:
::; Experimental: This section contains all of the reagents you used in your experiment, most likely accompanied by any hazard warnings they might carry. If a colleague wants to reproduce your experiment, they need to know what they are getting themselves into. Also described here should be all of the equipment used in your data collection process, including specific equipment names and numbers.
::; Procedure: This section contains the steps taken during your experiment. If you used a procedure previously recorded elsewhere, feel free to simply reference that procedure to save time and precious space for data. If you are using a self-written procedure, you need to meticulously write every step down so that your experiment could be repeated in exactly the same way by a different team of scientists.
::; Results : Here you would record all of the numerical data you generated during your experiment. Refrain from drawing conclusions. Simply enter tables, graphs, and numbers that are pertinent to your conclusions.

; Conclusion : In your conclusion, you should focus on the data you presented. Share and discuss your results. Here you are allowed to give your opinion on what the results mean. Although you are given the freedom to interpret your data how you see fit, avoid linking your findings with other, unexplored subject matter.  If you didn't cover it in your introduction or experiment, leave it out of the conclusion!

; Acknowledgments : Sometimes, but often not, you will need to put this section in. Examples are if you have used a service to run spectra or analysis for you, or someone has given you help by lending some part of their apparatus made for a different experiment. Acknowledgment sections are very appropriate and recommended for academic writing, as all equipment utilized usually belongs to the university. Some scientific service providers &lt;b&gt;require&lt;/b&gt; a specific form of words in the acknowledgment as part of their regulations. These will be provided along with the results of your submitted sample.

; References Cited Page : Follow the specific documentation style chosen or required. If citing, for example, a huge reference book of analytical and preparatory chemistry, give the page or chapter number so the reader stands a chance of finding the text you used. It is a good idea to make sure you cite any important references already cited for you in the laboratory instructions and add some more to show that you have looked further than just reading your assignment brief.

; Appendix: This section is reserved for boring calculations and notes that you made during the actual experimentation process. No one really wants to see your hand written notes, but you are still required to present them to prove that you did observe what you claim in your paper. This section, therefore, usually contains a photocopy of the laboratory notebook page, or pages, that contain data and comments relevant to your paper.

=== Resources to Use ===

Seeing as writing in the natural sciences is technical in nature, you will find that your resources are going to have to be scholarly, comprehensive, and up-to-date (the only time you should use a reference that is several years old is to do comparisons).
The first step is to educate yourself on your topic by locating information through a simple search.  Information and data can be compiled by doing a search and writing down the information you find to familiarize yourself with the subject.  When you feel comfortable with the level of knowledge of this information, you can move on to the next step in the research process.

That next step is finding encyclopedias, textbooks, reference books, and the like to continue filling in the details on your topic.  These resources will be dedicated to the chosen topic.  They will provide more detailed information and help you fill in any holes in your research or to simply answer questions that may have popped up during the information gathering stage. A good way to find if there are newer articles than your favorite reference is to use the ''citing references'' feature of many search systems. These might well give you a link to a more comprehensive and up to date reference.  

Finally, you will turn to review articles, lab reports, and research reports to get the most up-to-date information.  This is the most important resource you will use, and the most challenging.  These articles and reports provide information that reveal the most recent discoveries on the chosen topic.  However, they also tend to be technical in nature and are written in a way that assumes the reader is familiar with technical jargon associated with the field or subject.  While keeping this in mind, review articles and research reports will round out your resource selection nicely.

Don't be afraid to search the Internet for information.  There is a great deal of good stuff out there, but you should be careful in what you use.  Be sure to gather any Internet information from a scholarly source, such as an educational site or a non-profit site. Use the Internet as a ''secondary'' or even better a ''tertiary source'' and preferably cite a review article or a ''journal of record''. The citing of either the Internet or encyclopedias is sometimes expressly forbidden so you need to check on institutional policy here. (Despite this some book series, though they have ''encyclopedia'' in the title, such as Wiley's ''The Encyclopedia of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance'' are actually review journals and are eminently citable.) Internet articles change and so a citation should include the date accessed, for example:

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
EDEXCEL http://www.edexcel.org.uk/Qualifications [accessed 27th October 2004].|caption=Example citation for internet article. Note that the date accessed has been included.}}

===Acronyms and Abbreviations===
Science abounds in acronyms and abbreviations, which can be very irritating if you are not in the know. Even common ones like IR for infrared spectroscopy or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) should be named in full followed by the abbreviation the first time they are mentioned and then the abbreviation used from then on. 
{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
...the first sessions on Computer Aided Design (CAD) come in the General Computing Laboratory in year 1 (GCLy1). Subsequently CAD teaching is embedded in the course work.''|caption=Correct use of an Acronym}}
Acronyms do not always mean the same to different people. A RAS can be either a ''Reusable Asset Specification'', or in a system performance context ''Reliability, Availability and Serviceability'' or many would guess it is a ''Random Access Something-or-other''

Longer reviews in subjects like biochemistry which have to name numerous macromolecules and cell constituents might require a separate ''acronyms glossary'' after the references and bibliography.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Is Punctuation For? ==

&quot;Proper punctuation&quot; shows up repeatedly in discussions about expectations and criteria for what constitutes good academic writing — whether it's administrators, teachers, students, or legislators talking about what should be taught in the first-year writing classroom. But the word &quot;proper&quot; might limit or even mislead our thinking of punctuation. Used knowledgeably and deliberately, punctuation is more than proper;  it's essential to making meaning. Also, there's a faint connotation of &quot;arbitrary&quot; with the word &quot;proper&quot; — and effective punctuation is anything but arbitrary.  

Nor is punctuation merely a reflection of oral behavior, as suggested by the familiar injunctions &quot;Use a comma for a pause&quot; or &quot;Where your voice drops, use a period.&quot; Instead, punctuation functions as a rich set of clues that have emerged specifically for readers working through text on a page or screen, visually and two-dimensionally. 

The nature of reading demands such clues precisely because text is not speech. Speakers have pitch, pace, hand gestures, facial expressions, and other means to let a listener know such things as which points to link to each other and which points should stand on their own, or whether information is necessary in that it restricts meaning or whether it is extraneous. Moreover, ordinary speech usually accommodates a listener's questions, allowing for a more rapid arrival at a joint understanding between speaker and listener. The greater temporal and spatial distance between writer and reader, however, calls for a code that can work to give clues about the writer's intended meaning in the absence of such direct two-way communication.

== Is It Worth the Work? ==

While punctuation does function as a vital part of making meaning within a text, it can’t be denied that it serves another function as well: that of credibility marker. Using punctuation according to the conventions of the academic community does serve as a sort of license into, and within, that community. To take the time and effort to learn and use punctuation conventionally sends the message to readers that “I’m part of your community; I can speak your language (use your code). So, listen to me.” It signals a sort of collegial willingness to hear and to be heard: to use a common code that enhances and expands understandability instead of restricting it to yourself. Codes can exclude and include; by using the code of “correct” punctuation, you’re signaling a willingness to be included in a group of people who’ve agreed on how to use certain dots and squiggles on the page to indicate certain relationships among ideas. For whatever reason you value inclusion in the academic community, subscribing to (buying into) conventional punctuation is one among many certificates of authenticity you can carry.

Why is that? Why should conventional punctuation exert such influence? Part of the answer can be found in the way different punctuation marks support characteristics that the academic community values in its overall discourse. This is another way in which conventional punctuation operates on more than a merely arbitrary level: It serves to indicate relationships among ideas in a sentence or paragraph that echo the very ways in which the academic community organizes and develops its lines of thought. Those ways include segmentation, coordination, subordination, modification, and supplementation -- concepts discussed later in this section.

== What's With All the Jargon? ==

Have you ever tried to complete a task with someone who doesn’t know the names of the objects you’re working with? Think of changing your oil with a person who doesn’t know the terms “dipstick,” “oil pan,” “drain plug,” or “filter wrench.” Or imagine trying to show someone how to make an omelet, and they don’t know what a “whisk” is or what it means to “dice” onions. Chances are, it will take longer than usual for you to get the task done; perhaps you may even decide to start off with a brief vocabulary review before focusing on the task itself. Let’s face it, “that thingy there” takes you only so far.

Like other specialized subjects, punctuation has a specialized vocabulary that allows us to talk about it: a set of terms we use to name parts, describe purposes, explain activities, and identify errors. The attractive thing about a lexicon is that it saves time by eliminating a lot of guesswork and reinvention. While punctuation jargon can sometimes sound unnecessarily inflated (the word “and,” for example, is a “coordinating conjunction”) or even faintly accusatory (an unnecessary comma is called “disruptive”), having a consistent set of terms makes it easier to use punctuation correctly.

In short: Yes, it does help to know some of the jargon when learning punctuation. The good news is, once you learn a few terms, you can plug them into formulas that you can use to quickly get a solid grasp on correct punctuation.

=== OK, which terms do I need to know? ===

The sections below about specific punctuation marks introduce terms as you’ll need them. But there are a few terms it helps to know beforehand.

==== Independent clause ====

This is a group of words that could stand on its own as a complete sentence because it expresses a complete thought. 

How can you tell if a thought or sentence is “complete”? While there are more complicated tests involving more jargon, one simple test that usually works is to read the group of words out loud with extra expressiveness. We almost always can “hear” completeness or incompleteness. Every independent clause must have a subject (even if it is only implied as in a command) and a verb (even if it is only the verb to be). 

When you read an independent clause aloud, it has a sound of being finished. You and any other listener are not waiting for more information. Your voice usually drops with an air of finality when you are done reading an independent clause aloud.

'''Examples:'''
* ''Conflict resolution requires looking first at involved parties collectively.''
* ''One challenge is determining whether all parties truly want to resolve the conflict.''
* ''The conflict may be serving another purpose.''

==== Dependent clause ====

In contrast, when you read a  dependent clause aloud, you or your listener has the feeling of “Well...? What’s next? Finish it up!” A dependent clause is a group of words that can’t stand on its own as a sentence because it does not express a complete thought. It leaves the listener (and reader) hanging.

In addition, there are certain words that make a clause dependent. When the following words appear at the beginning of a clause, that clause is dependent:

''after, although, as, as if, as long as, as soon as, as though, because, before, during, even if, even though, ever since, if, in case, in order that, once, on condition that, provided that, since, so that, then, though, unless, until, what, whatever, when, whenever, whether, which, whichever, while, whomever, whose, why''

'''Examples:'''
* ''Until all parties agree that resolution is a shared priority''
* ''Which allows the process to move forward''
* ''An example being one person who retains power as long as the conflict goes unsolved''

'''Independent clause''' and '''dependent clause''' refer to groups of words. Two more terms it helps to know beforehand are labels for certain individual words.

==== Coordinating conjunctions ====

When these seven short words words link two independent clauses together within one sentence, they are called coordinating conjunctions:

''and, but, for, nor, or, so, yet''

Each coordinating conjunction signals a specific relationship between the independent clauses it joins.

* '''And''' signals addition and extension. Used with a comma between two independent clauses, it tells the reader that the thoughts expressed in those clauses should be considered together and with equal weight.
*: ''Each workplace conflict is unique, and each requires its own assessment.''
* '''But''' expresses contrast. It tells readers that the thought expressed in the second independent clause is in opposition to, or otherwise different from, the thought expressed in the first independent clause.
*: ''Each workplace conflict is unique, but several general principles apply to finding solutions.''
* '''For''' signals that the second thought is a statement of causation relative to the first thought or that the second thought should be considered as significantly informing the first thought. 
*: ''Each workplace conflict is unique, for each context is unique.''
* '''Nor''' links two complete thoughts expressed as negatives, indicating that neither is an option.
*: ''Serious conflicts cannot be solved by ignoring them, nor can they be solved by attempting to legislate past them.''
* '''Or''' conveys option/choice or consequence (as in the sense of “or else”) between the two thoughts.
*: ''Conflicts may be resolved with one mediated discussion, or extended negotiation may be required to bring about consensus.''
* '''So''' signals that the second thought is a statement of effect or consequence relative to the first thought. 
*: ''Workplace conflicts can ultimately be opportunities for growth, so managers should approach them confidently.''
* '''Yet''' &lt;/b&gt; tells the reader that the thought expressed in the second independent clause is in opposition or contrast to the first. It also can indicate simultaneity, in effect saying to the reader, “At the same time, after you’ve read the first thought, you should also consider this thought.” 
*: ''Workplace conflicts can ultimately be opportunities for growth, yet most managers approach them with dread and apprehension.''

==== Conjunctive adverbs ====

These are words expressing a relationship or transition between two independent clauses. Common conjunctive adverbs are:

''so, otherwise, also, consequently, for example, furthermore, however, in addition, in contrast, in fact, instead, likewise, moreover, nevertheless, otherwise, still, then, therefore''

Conjunctive adverbs other than SO or OTHERWISE require either a period or semicolon preceding them and a comma following them. Once you understand these terms, you’re ready to look at punctuation formulas for using commas, semicolons, and colons.

Example #1  The CEO will be attending the lecture; accordingly, the vice president will be available for the luncheon at noon. 

The two clauses are independent. The semicolon replaces a coordinating conjunction and indicates that the two clauses are independent.

Example #2  Jaime wanted to see &quot;Billy Madison&quot;; however, Nick wanted to see &quot;Happy Gilmore.&quot; 

The two clauses are independent. The semicolon replaces a coordinating conjunction and indicates that the two clauses are independent.

===Uses of &quot;That&quot;===

'' That'' in the English language serves five different syntactic functions. They are:

 1. Demonstrative determiner
    example: ''That'' house

 2. Demonstrative pronoun
    example:'' That'' is my car

 3. Functions as a noun
    example: ''That'' works for me.

 4. Complementizer
    example: I know ''that'' she was waiting for me

 5. Relative pronoun 
    example: The book ''that'' I read was interesting

      <text xml:space="preserve">Zoning is an important concept both in real-life town planning, and in the SimCity game.

=== Zoning in Urban Planning ===
Zoning is a system of land use regulation which designates the permitted uses of land based on mapped zones, which separate one part of the community from another. Theoretically, its primary purpose is to segregate uses that are thought to be incompatible. In practice, zoning is used as a permitting system to prevent new development from harming existing residents or businesses. Zoning is commonly controlled by local governments such as counties or municipalities.

Zoning commonly includes regulation of the kinds of activities which will be acceptable on particular lots (such as open space, residential, agricultural, commercial or industrial), the densities at which those activities can be performed (low density housing such as single family homes to high density such as apartment buildings), the height of buildings, the amount of space structures may occupy by limiting how close a building may be from the edge of the lot, the proportions of the types of space on a lot (for example, how much landscaped space and how much paved space), and how much parking must be provided.

Most zoning systems have a procedure for granting variances - exceptions to the zoning rules, usually because of some perceived hardship due to the particular nature of the property in question.

While it is rare that cities are planned from scratch planners are important in managing the growth of cities, applying tools like zoning to manage the uses of land, and growth management to manage the pace of development. When examined historically, many of the cities now thought to be most beautiful are the result of dense, long lasting systems of prohibitions and guidance about building sizes, uses and features. These allowed substantial freedoms, yet enforce styles, safety, and often materials in practical ways. Many conventional planning techniques are being repackaged as smart growth.

There are some cities that have been planned from conception, and while the results often don't turn out quite as planned, evidence of the initial plan often remains. Some of the most successful planned cities consist of cells that include park-space, commerce and housing, and then repeat the cell. Usually cells are separated by streets. Often each cell has unique monuments and gardening in the park, and unique gates or boundary-markers for the edges of the cell. The commercial areas naturally become diverse. These differences help instill a sense of place, while the similarities of the cells make each place in the city familiar.

=== Zoning in SimCity ===
In SimCity, players can chose to zone land as residential, commercial, or industrial. From SC2K onwards, players can also chose the density of various zones in their city.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A key aspect of planning, both in real life urban planning, and in SimCity, is natural disasters.

=== Natural Disasters in real-life Urban Planning ===
Many cities are constructed in places subject to flood, storm surges, extreme weather or war. City planners can cope with these. If the dangers can be localized (for flood or storm surge), the affected regions can be made into parkland or greenbelt, often with lovely results. Another practical method is simply to build the city on ridges, and the parks and farms in valleys.

Extreme weather, flood, war or other emergencies can often be greatly mitigated with secure evacuation routes and emergency operations centers. These are relatively inexpensive and unobtrusive, and many consider them a reasonable precaution for any urban space.

Many cities also have planned, built safety features, such as levees, retaining walls, and shelters.

Some planning methods might help an elite group to control ordinary citizens. This was certainly the case of Rome (Italy), where Fascism in the 1930s created ex novo many new suburbs in order to concentrate criminals and poorer classes away from the elegant town. France currently uses similar methods to control ethnic-Arabic groups on welfare.

In recent years, practitioners have also been expected to maximize the accessibility of an area to people with different abilities, practicing the notion of &quot;inclusive design,&quot; to anticipate criminal behavior and consequently to &quot;design-out crime&quot; and to consider &quot;traffic calming&quot; or &quot;pedestrianization&quot; as ways of making urban life more bearable.

City planning tries to control criminality with structures designed from theories like socio-architecture or environmental determinism. These theories say that an urban environment can influence individuals' obedience to social rules. The theories often say that psychological pressure develops in more densely developed, unadorned areas. This stress causes some crimes and some use of illegal drugs. The antidote is usually more individual space and better, more beautiful design in place of functionalism.

Other social theories point out that in England and most countries since the 18th century, the transformation of societies from rural agriculture to industry caused a difficult adaptation to urban living. These theories emphasize that many planning policies ignore personal tensions, forcing individuals to live in a condition of perpetual extraneity to their cities. Many people therefore lack the comfort of feeling &quot;at home&quot; when at home. Often these theorists seek a reconsideration of commonly used &quot;standards&quot; that rationalize the outcomes of a free (relatively unregulated) market.

===Natural Disasters in SimCity===
The SimCity games also incorporate natural disasters - either recurring randomly (if you so chose), or by your selection. Natural disasters include flooding, tornadoes, fires, riots, earthquakes, etc. Later disasters included lightning strikes, volcanoes, meteors and attack by extra-terrestrial craft. 

Effective planning can be used to limit the impact of natural disasters; for example, building enough Fire Stations (and adequately funding the fire department) can prevent a major fire from engulfing your SimCity.

===Disasters in Simcity===

====Fire====

'''Fires''' can break out at random. They tend to strike areas of forest or industry. They can be prevented, by ensuring comprehensive fire station coverage, but cannot be fought after they break out.

====Flood====

'''Flooding''' results in widespread damage to water front properties. It is unpreventable.

====Monster====

A large, [[w:Godzilla|Godzilla]]esque '''monster''' appears and attacks the city. The monster tends to attack polluted areas such as industrial zones and airports. It destroys whatever it touches. If it happens to reach a garbage dump it will proceed to eat garbage and empty out the dump.

===Disasters in Simcity 2000===

====Air Crash====

'''Air crashes''' happen intermittently, whether &quot;No Disasters&quot; is selected or not. However, with &quot;No Disasters&quot; off, the aeroplane will explode upon collision with the ground, setting fire to surrounding tiles.

====Fire====

'''Fire''' tends to break in industrial or abandoned buildings. It can be fought by using &quot;Fire&quot; dispatches. Fires can be caused by riots, earthquakes, UFO attacks and microwave power station misfire.

====Riot====

'''Riots''' break out in cities with poor police coverage. They can be fought using the &quot;Police&quot; and &quot;Military&quot; dispatches.

====Monster====

A large, floating, '''monster''' appears over the city, zapping targets with a large ray gun. This gun produces either fire, trees or wind turbines to appear at the target, destroying buildings and roads. The monster can be fought by the &quot;Military&quot; dispatch.

====Floods====

'''Floods''' occur at random, and are most dangerous to water front properties. Placing a wall of dispatches represents building sandbag walls and levees, and as such, protects buildings. Larger floods occur on typing of the code &quot;Noah&quot;.

====Chemical cloud====

The ''''chemical cloud''' disaster occurs over polluted areas. The cloud drifts across the city, causing abandonment of buildings beneath. It is unfightable.

====Nuclear meltdown====

The '''nuclear meltdown''' disaster occurs randomly at nuclear power stations, especially during fires and earthquakes. It is unpreventable and renders a large area of the city, marked with radioactive symbols, uninhabitable.

===Disasters in Simcity 3000===

Note: All disasters in Simicity 3000 can be mitigated with the emergency siren.

====Fire====

See above.

====Riots====

See above.

====UFO====

A fleet of UFOs appear and randomly attack the city. They are unfightable and leave circles in corn fields. The swarm can be made larger by the cheat code &quot;UFO swarm&quot;.

====Chemical cloud====

As Simcity 2000, except that the cloud also produces acid rain, which destroys road.

====Whirlpool====

(3000 Unlimited only)

A large '''whirlpool''' appears randomly in the ocean. This destroys waterfront buildings and sinks ships. This disaster is unavoidable.

====Space junk====

(3000 Unlimited only)

'''Space junk''' is the most devastating disaster on Simcity 3000, and is completely unpreventable. It results in most of the map being destroyed and cratered. It is unavoidable and unfightable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Creating a pleasant environment to live in is a concern both of real-life urban planning, as well as in the game SimCity.

=== Environmental planning in real-life Urban Design ===
Environmental concerns have been a growing focus for urban planners. Arcology seeks to unify the fields of ecology and architecture, especially landscape architecture, to achieve a harmonious environment for all living things. On a small scale, the eco-village theory has become popular, as it emphasizes a traditional 100-140 person scale for communities.

In most advanced urban or village planning models, local context is critical. In many, gardening assumes a central role not only in agriculture but in the daily life of citizens. A series of related movements including green anarchism, eco-anarchism, eco-feminism and Slow Food have put this in a political context as part of a focus on smaller systems of resource extraction, and waste disposal, ideally as part of living machines which do such recycling automatically, just as nature does. The modern theory of natural capital emphasizes this as the primary difference between natural and infrastructural capital, and seeks an economic basis for rationalizing a move back towards smaller village units.

=== The Environment in SimCity ===
SimCity provides a number of options for making your city a pleasant place to live for your SimCitizens. This can be done by building parks around your city. In the game, parks reduce pollution and increase land value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Financial considerations are important in both real life Urban planning, and in SimCity.

===Fiscal Policy in real life Government===
Fiscal Policy is the economic term which describes the behavior of governments in raising money to fund current spending and investment for collective social purposes and for transfer payments to citizens and residents of the territory for which the government is responsible. The money may be raised by taxation, by borrowing, by user charges on social assets or services, or by fiat. (On the last, the government declares a particular token to be money and demands that it be accepted in settlement of debts.) Fiscal policy can include deficit spending to stimulate demand for domestic goods and services to rise (to fight unemployment) or efforts to cut deficits or raise the budget surplus to fight inflation.

===Budgets in SimCity===
In the game SimCity, as in real-life, balancing budgets is an important role of the mayor. Financial considerations are important when planning out your city. As the mayor of a SimCity, you raise money for explaining your city through taxes, ordinances, and loans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the start of a Blender/Python manual. At the moment the most useful areas are the optimization guide and the cookbook.

Python is high-level, easy to learn scripting language, that can be applied to various aspects of Blender, and MANY other things. For an introduction, download it. Then google Python Tutorial, and you'll find a wealth of excellent beginner's tutorials. Once you've mastered the basics, you can start learning Blender type stuff.

== Introduction ==

Most Korean dictionaries list verbs ([[wikt:동사|동사]]) in a form that ends in [[wikt:다|다(da)]]:

{|
|-
| valign=top |
* [[wikt:이다|이다]]: to be
* [[wikt:사다|사다]]: to buy
* [[wikt:전화하다|전화하다]]: to call
* [[wikt:만들다|만들다]]: to make/create

* [[wikt:먹다|먹다]]: to eat
* [[wikt:가다|가다]]: to go
* [[wikt:주다|주다]]: to give
* [[wikt:갖다|갖다]]: to have
| valign=top |
* [[wikt:싫어하다|싫어하다]]: to dislike/hate
* [[wikt:알다|알다]]: to know
* [[wikt:배우다|배우다]]: to learn
* [[wikt:좋아하다|좋아하다]]: to like
* [[wikt:사랑하다|사랑하다]]: to love
* [[wikt:듣다|듣다]]: to listen/hear
* [[wikt:움직이다|움직이다]]: to move (around)
* [[wikt:놀다|놀다]]: to play
* [[wikt:읽다|읽다]]: to read

* [[wikt:걷다|걷다]]: to walk
* [[wikt:잠자다|잠자다]]: to sleep
|}

== Verb stems ==

Similar to English verbs, Korean verbs change their endings and take auxiliary words to fit the tense (when an action occurs) and mood (statements vs. commands vs. questions) of the situation.  However, Korean verbs also change form to express [[w:Korean honorifics|honorifics and speech levels]] in order to reflect the social relationships between the speaker, the subject, and the audience. The speech level listed in most books (including dictionaries) is called [[wikt:해라체|해라체]].  It is formal but of low to neutral politeness.  The 해라체 speech level is sometimes used by close friends, relatives of similar age, and young people.  As shown above, the indicative forms of verbs in the 해라체 speech level end in [[wikt:다|다]].  The part of the word preceding 다 is called the &quot;verb stem&quot;.

=== Exercise ===
Identify the verb stem of the following verbs:
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:하다|하다]]
| answer = Stem: 하 }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:마시다|마시다]]
| answer = Stem: 마시 }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:먹다|먹다]]
| answer = Stem: 먹 }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:가다|가다]]
| answer = Stem: 가 }}

== Honorifics ==

Korean grammar expresses the relationship between the speaker, the subject, and the listener by using [[w:Korean honorifics|honorifics and speech levels]] in conjugation and word choice.  Honorifics express the speaker's relationship and politeness or social humility toward the subject of the sentence, and speech levels to express these to the audience. When talking about someone of superior status, one must indicate their superiority by using special honorific affixes. Generally, someone is considered superior in status if he or she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, an employer, a teacher, a customer, or the like.  Someone is looked upon as equal or inferior in status if he or she is a younger stranger, a student, an employee or the like.

Note: If the subject is considered inferior to the listener, the honorific should ''not'' be used, as the misuse of honorifics or the use of inappropriate speech levels is likely to be considered insulting, or hilariously disrespectful.

A few Korean verbs have special honorific equivalents, but most can be converted into an honorific form by adding an honorific affix after the stem and before the ending. 

If the verb stem ends in a vowel, add [[wikt:시|시]], 

but if it ends in a consonant, add [[wikt:으시|으시]].  

Thus, the honorific form of [[wikt:가다|가다]] (&quot;to go&quot;) is 가시다 and the honorific form of [[wikt:걷다|걷다]] (&quot;to walk&quot;) is 걸으시다.

=== Exercise ===

Write the honorific form of the following verbs:

{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:먹다|먹다]] | hint = the stem ends in a consonant
| answer = &lt;big&gt;먹으시다&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:가다|가다]]
| answer = &lt;big&gt;가시다&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = [[wikt:작다|작다]]
| answer = &lt;big&gt;작으시다&lt;/big&gt; }}

Since the 해라체 speech level is not polite enough for many of the initial encounters you might have speaking Korean, we will first learn a polite speech level instead. [[wikt:합쇼체|합쇼체]] is the formal, polite speech level in Korean.  It is used commonly between strangers, among male co-workers, by TV announcers, and to customers.

To create statements (that is, to use the indicative mood of verbs) in the 합쇼체 form, 

⋅Add the honorific affix 시 or 으시 if applicable.  
⋅Then add ㅂ니다 if the result ends in a vowel or 습니다 if it ends in a consonant.  E.g.:

{|
! Verb !! Stem !! Subject !! Add polite ending !! Complete 합쇼체 form
|-
| Verb Stems ending in vowels
|-
| [[wikt:가다|가다]] || 가 || (Non-honorific)
| align=center | 가 ㅂ니다 || 갑니다
|-
| [[wikt:가다|가다]] || 가 || (Honorific) 시
| align=center | 가시 ㅂ니다 || 가십니다
|-
| Verb Stems ending in consonants
|-
| [[wikt:읽다|읽다]] || 읽 || (Non-honorific)
| align=center | 읽 습니다 || 읽습니다
|-
| [[wikt:읽다|읽다]] || 읽 || (Honorific) 으시
| align=center | 읽으시 ㅂ니다 || 읽으십니다
|}

=== Exercise ===

In this exercise, you are talking with a stranger about various subjects.  Determine correct 합쇼체 form for the following verbs based on the given subject:
{{Korean/Question-answer | leader = (an older stranger) goes: | kor = 가다
| answer = (honorific) &lt;big&gt;가십니다&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | leader = (my employee) types: | kor = 타이프하다
| answer = (non-honorific) &lt;big&gt;타이프합니다&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | leader = (my employer) knows: | kor = 알다
| answer = (honorific) &lt;big&gt;아십니다&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | leader = (a younger stranger) buys: | kor = 사다
| answer = (non-honorific) &lt;big&gt;삽니다&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | leader = (a stranger my own age) calls: | kor = 전화하다
| answer = (honorific) &lt;big&gt;전화하십니다&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | leader = (my older uncle) speaks: | kor = 말하다
| answer = (honorific) &lt;big&gt;말하십니다&lt;/big&gt; (Most koreans use the verb &quot;말씀하다&quot; when they talk to an old person. Therefore, &quot;말씀하십니다&quot; is a better answer.) }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | leader = (my teacher) teaches: | kor = 가르치다
| answer = (honorific) &lt;big&gt;가르치십니다&lt;/big&gt; }}

== Informal polite speech level ==
When people of similar age or social standing converse, they often use the informal polite speech level, called [[wikt:해요체|해요체]].  해요체 is appropriately polite for most of the situations you will typically encounter, so it is the next form to learn.

To create the 해요체 form of Korean verbs, do the following:
# Take the stem.
# Add the honorific 시 or 으시 if applicable.
# If the last letter is ㅂ, change it to 우.
# If the result ends in a vowel followed by 르, insert an extra ㄹ, making the end ㄹ르.
# If the last vowel is now ㅡ, change it to ㅏ if the next-to-last vowel is ㅗ or ㅏ. Otherwise, change ㅡ to ㅓ.
# If the last vowel is now ㅗ or ㅏ, add ㅏ요. 
# If the last character is 하, add ㅕ요.
# For others, add ㅓ요.

Korean spelling rules make the above rules seem just a bit more complicated in practice:
* If the result ends in ㅏㅏ요, that collapses to ㅏ요.
* If the result ends in ㅗㅏ요, that collapses to ㅘ요.
* If the result ends in ㅜㅓ요, that collapses to ㅝ요.
* If the result ends in 시ㅓ요, that collapses to 세요.
* If the result ends in ㅣㅓ요, that collapses to ㅕ요.
* If the result ends in 하ㅕ요, that collapses to 해요.

The usual spelling rules also apply, so an ㅏ without an initial consonant is written as 아 and an ㅓ without an initial consonant is written as 어.

| align=center | 써ㅓ요 || 써요
|}

=== Exercise ===

In this exercise, you are talking with a friend about various subjects.  Determine correct 해요체 form for the following verbs in both honorific and non-honorific forms:
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 주다
| answer =(honorific)&lt;big&gt;주세요&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(non-honorific)&lt;big&gt;줘요&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 갖다
| answer =(honorific)&lt;big&gt;갖으세요&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(non-honorific)&lt;big&gt;가져요&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 사랑하다
| answer =(honorific)&lt;big&gt;사랑하세요&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(non-honorific)&lt;big&gt;사랑해요&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 마시다
| answer =(honorific)&lt;big&gt;마시세요&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(non-honorific)&lt;big&gt;마셔요&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 없다
| answer =(honorific)&lt;big&gt;없으세요&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(non-honorific)&lt;big&gt;없어요&lt;/big&gt; }}

== Casual speech level ==
When close friends and relatives talk with each other, they may use a very casual speech level called [[wikt:해체|해체]].  Be careful not to use this 해체 with someone with whom you are not very close, as it can be considered offensive.

Since you already know the 해요체 form, creating the casual 해체 form of Korean verbs is easy, just take the 요 off of the end of the 해요체 form:

{|
! Verb !! 해요체 form !! 해체 form
|-
| [[wikt:가다|가다]]: || 가요 || 가
|-
| [[wikt:오다|오다]]: || 와요 || 와
|-
| [[wikt:덥다|덥다]]: || 더워요 || 더워
|-
| [[wikt:모르다|모르다]] || 몰라요 || 몰라
|}

=== Exercise ===

In this exercise, you are talking with a close friend.  Determine correct 해체 form for the following verbs:

{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 주다
| answer =&lt;big&gt;줘&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 갖다
| answer =&lt;big&gt;가져&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 사랑하다
| answer =&lt;big&gt;사랑해&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 마시다
| answer =&lt;big&gt;마셔&lt;/big&gt; }}
{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 없다
| answer =&lt;big&gt;없어&lt;/big&gt; }}

== Tense ==
Korean verbs can be conjugated into several different tenses to indicate the time when an event occurs.

=== Past tense ===
The past tense of a Korean verb is formed as follows:
# Take the verb stem.
# Add the honorific suffix (시 or 으시) if applicable.
# Add one of the following:
#* If the word now ends in 하, add 였.  Note: 하였 often is contracted as 했.
#* Otherwise, if the preceding vowel of the verb stem is ㅏ or ㅗ, add 았.
#* Otherwise, add 었.
# Add the ending for the appropriate speech level.

{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 하다
| answer =Informal polite speech level:&lt;br /&gt;
(honorific)&lt;big&gt;하셨어요&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(non-honorific)&lt;big&gt;했어요&lt;/big&gt; }}

{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 가다
| answer =Informal polite speech level:&lt;br /&gt;
(honorific)&lt;big&gt;가셨어요&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(non-honorific)&lt;big&gt;갔어요&lt;/big&gt; }}

{{Korean/Question-answer | kor = 읽다
| answer =Informal polite speech level:&lt;br /&gt;
(honorific)&lt;big&gt;읽으셨어요&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(non-honorific)&lt;big&gt;읽었어요&lt;/big&gt; }}

=== Future tense ===
The future tense of a Korean verb is formed as follows:
# Take the verb stem.
# Add the honorific suffix (시 or 으시) if applicable.
# Add the suffix 겠.
# Add the ending for the appropriate speech level.

=== Other tenses ===
Korean also has a remote past tense, used to indicate that an event occurred long ago, a past future tense, and a (rarely-used) remote past future tense.  To form the remote past tense, first form the past tense, then add an extra 었 before the ending for the appropriate speech level.

== Copula and existence verb ==
이다 and 있다:
&lt;!-- Not sure whether this belongs here.  It's an exception that probably doesn't need to be taught until later.  --&gt;
Two Korean words conjugate similar to verbs and are often translated as verbs but are not considered verbs in Korean grammar: [[wikt:이다|이다]] (the copula, often translated as &quot;to be&quot;) and [[wikt:있다|있다]] (the existence particle, often translated as &quot;to exist&quot;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, how dry do the curds have to be?  Could we possibly use Ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese?  It is already considerably drier.
Hi! My family is Russian, and I LOVE sirniki. In answer to your question, we never heard of sirniki with cottage cheese. It is almost always made with tvarog (I think in English that it is called Russian farmer's cheese). Tvarog is very dry. It can also have sweet fillings like jam or dried fruit (often apricots or raisins). The sweeter versions are often used to make sirniki. If you use the plain version, the sirniki are often often served with jam. 
(Unrelated: for some reason when I think about Russian food, or Russian things in general, my English gets messed up. Usually I speak better then this.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thanks for popping into the Chrono Trigger wikibook.

Here's the gamefaqs entry for the game, by the way, it's got a lot of exhaustive FAQs, the problem is they have a lot of conflicting information: http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/game/563538.html

One thing I could really use some help investigating is:

For the trial sequence, which juror voting innocent or guilty corresponds to which action you take, such as the first juror depending on whether you talked to Marle before grabbing her pendant, trying to sell it, etc. Different sites have different theories, and one site even suggests the second juror is just glitched and chooses randomly. If we could settle that one it would be nice.

I'll probably hammer through the walkthrough as I play through the game again myself, anything you could contribute would be welcome.--[[User:BigCow|BigCow]] 15:09, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Peaceman. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Peaceman~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Municipal infrastructure typically includes transportation, sewer, reservoir, potable water supply systems, police stations and local jails, and other infrastructural capital - the built environment - under the jurisdiction of a municipal government or other local government.

The terms urban infrastructure and rural development are often used interchangeably but imply either large cities or developing nations' concerns respectively. The terms public infrastructure or critical infrastructure are also used interchangeably but suggest the inclusion of some facilities like hospitals, banks and concerns like national security and terrorism which are not under the mandate of municipal officials alone.

Typically, infrastructure in the urban context denotes two general groups of support systems: transportation modalities (roads, rail, etc.) and utilities. These typically compose both public and private systems, and some ambiguously held in common.

Infrastructure may also refer to necessary municipal or public services, whether provided by the government or by private companies. If provided by nature, e.g. the flow of a river, they are called nature's services and are distincted (at least in economics) as the product of natural capital. This may be augmented or directed by infrastructural capital, e.g. a dam or canal or irrigation ditch. In general what is called infrastructure tends to be very embedded in the natural landscape and cannot be moved from place to place. Even municipal services rely necessarily on fixed locations, e.g. fire stations in central positions in a city, radio towers on tall buildings, etc.

Beyond transport (which is discussed in another chapter), Urban infrastructure includes:
*Public utilities
**Electricity
**Natural gas
**Coal delivery
**Water supply
**Sewers
**Telephone service
**Radio and television bandwidth allocation
**Cable television service
*Public services
**Fire service or fire department
**Flood protection
**Police protection
**Waste management
*National Services
**Defense
**Monetary systems or currency, including the minting of coins, and printing and backing of banknotes.
**Postal system
*&quot;Soft Infrastructure&quot; is a term that denotes institutions that maintain the health and cultural standards of the population. Principally, this refers to:
**Public education
**Public health systems including public hospitals
**Public libraries
**Social welfare

===In SimCity===
A key aspect of SimCity is building tiles representing different utilities, public services, and soft infrastructure.

I suppose I need to explain why we need two different categories for Linux users: [[w:GNU|GNU]] is not [[w:Linux|Linux]], although most Linux-based operating systems use GNU. It is possible to have an OS using only Linux but not GNU. Plus, some users (like the creator of this page) would never accept to say that they use a &quot;Linux OS&quot; since they actually use a &quot;GNU/Linux OS&quot;. You should understand however that a GNU/Linux user is still a Linux user, as well as a GNU user.

== Wikification ==
I wikified this page to break it up and make it visually more appealing and easier to browse.  I'm not part of the class, just a friendly wikibook fellow stopping by.  If the edits aren't the direction you wanted to go, feel free to revert them. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 18:11, 23 September 2005 (UTC)


Do we really need the section on &quot;And you're off!&quot;? I am confused to why it is there, so if it needed, can someone explain what should go there? thanks. [[User: wost0201|wost0201]] 12/05/05

== Building Common Ground? ==


I don't think this Building Common Ground section belongs in the Drafting section.  I think this section should concentrate on problems and concerns specific to writing drafts, and the importance of drafting.  I've put the information here so that we can find another area for it. 

Building Common Ground
Ask yourself these questions to build common ground and prevent yourself from alienating readers:

Is there anything that is assumed between you and your readers? Explain in detail the ideas or positions being displayed in your writing that you once had to be informed on as well. Never assume your audience will completely understand or share your perspective. Also, watch for language implying bias on your part, language that suggests approval or disapproval, and the ways in which you employ we, you, and they. For example, when you use the word &quot;you&quot; the reader is now included in the paper itself, and if they don't agree with the sentence that the &quot;you&quot; appears in, they will view the usage negatively. 
Have you done away with language that could be perceived as sexist? An effective way to avoid problems with gender is to make things plural: say readers instead of reader to avoid needing he/she. 
Ensure that any references to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. are necessary and pertinent to the discussion. Remember who your audience is. 
Are any terms used in reference to groups acceptable and accurate?

== Matt's Thoughts ==

First off, this chapter seems quote-heavy. I like the idea of having an opening quote to set the tone and mood, but it's overdone here. Let's lose all but the best or most relevant one to cut down on the distraction.

In the overview, I'd like to see some &quot;they&quot; talk, such as &quot;Many beginning writers assume drafting is a straightforward, linear process&quot; or so on; then we could explain that it is often more complex than that. I think the main thing to focus on here is that writers shouldn't be self-critical at this stage; just get some stuff down and worry about editing it later. I would also stress the importance of understanding the assignment and conventions before starting out; it's silly to draft something that will just be rejected out of hand. 

There are plenty of good metaphors to help people understand the drafting process. One is sculpting--start with a lump of clay and work it until you've got the sculpture you want. Another is pencil drawing; even a professional constantly erases and smudges hard lines--not because it was &quot;wrong,&quot; but because those techniques are essential to the craft. 

The &quot;Final Drafting Hints&quot; section has a misleading title; &quot;Final Draft&quot; is a technical term that shouldn't be confused here.

Finally, the example here seems weak. It's fine for a start, but we should see a series of drafts so that people get an idea of how it evolves over subsequent drafts. It'd also be a good idea to link to the sections on editing and revising here. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] ([[User talk:Mattbarton.exe|talk]]) 22:49, 13 January 2011 (UTC)

== Matt H's thoughts ==

I don’t know if some quotes have been removed since Matt B's &quot;quote heavy&quot; comment, but I actually like the quotes and feel that they offer some light-hearted variety.

The tone here works for me—seems really informal, accessible and unintimidating … perfect for college writers who want a quick place to start.

--[[User:Matt.helm|Matt.helm]] ([[User talk:Matt.helm|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Matt.helm|contribs]]) 02:39, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

== Faith's thoughts ==

I don't mind the quotes.  For those who like quotes, they're there and for those who don't, they're easy to simply overlook.  I also like the tone and style and believe that it is very student friendly.  One thing I miss here (and that I hear many students complain of) is writer's block.  There are several ways to adress the problem and drafting seems the most logical place to add it.--[[User:SFaithL|SFaithL]] ([[User talk:SFaithL|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SFaithL|contribs]]) 15:49, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

== Emily's Thoughts ==

This section does seem more accessible, although I do think there are too many quotes.  Is it possible to put them off to the side of the screen and not interfere with the flow of text?

Also, under &quot;Let it flow&quot; it seems like &quot;discouraged&quot; may be a more appropriate word than &quot;distracted.&quot;  
--[[User:Emily.isackson|Emily.isackson]] ([[User talk:Emily.isackson|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Emily.isackson|contribs]]) 20:42, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

== Karl's Thoughts ==

I'm a little confused by Dr. B's comments here, as I found this the most readable section so far. The remaining quotes at least seemed to make this piece feel much more accessible. Rather than talk down to me, it seems to talk &quot;with&quot; me. The fact that they're also in a different background color tells me that if I'm in a hurry I know where to skip. I appreciated that function. I think that Faith makes a good point about writers' block, but that may warrant a section of its own as there are so many approaches to dealing with it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many of the first proof-of-concept fMRI experiments were block designs with two conditions.  In a block design, each condition is presented continuously for a period usually longer than 20 seconds.  In the earliest fMRI studies (see Kwong, 1992, and Ogawa 1992), one commmon paradigm was to alternate between 60 second blocks of a flickering visual stimulus, and blocks without stimulation.  Analysis was done using a simple t-test between values of the MR signal collected in the &quot;on&quot; condition versus the &quot;off&quot; condition.  In addition to comparing &quot;on&quot; versus &quot;off&quot; conditions, block designs have been used to look at differences between more similar conditions as well. (Kanwisher has used block paradigms where the subject is presented with blocks of pictures of faces and blocks of pictures of houses to probe high-level features of the visual system)

These block designs tend to be quite powerful for assessing BOLD signal magnitude differences between conditions.  The length of the blocks of stimulation allows for the HRF to reach maximal values, while the inter-stimulus intervals are long enough for the HRF to return completely to baseline during non-stimulation.  The downside of block designs is that they are not powerful at estimating the shape of the haemodynamic response (aside from its magnitude).  

Block designs are also not as useful with many experimental paradigms  having special requirements.  In the DM paradigm for example, subjects are scanned while they are presented with single words.  After scanning, they are given a list of words composed of words seen earlier mixed with new words, and instructed to mark them as &quot;old&quot; or &quot;new&quot;.  For the old words, the fMRI trials are analyzed according to whether or not the subject remembered them during the second part of the experiment.  In this example, blocks of &quot;remembered&quot; and &quot;forgotten&quot; trials cannot be reliably constructed, because the event categorization depends on a parameter outside the control of the experimenter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Rounding =

== Rounding rules ==

The most commonly used method of rounding numbers is:
* less than five, round down,
* five or more, round up.


To round down, change the appropriate digits on the right to zeros.  Changing a digit to a zero makes the number smaller, rounds it down.
* Changing 72 to 70 yields a smaller number.


To round up, add one to the appropriate digit, and then change the digits on the right to zeros.  Adding 1 makes the number larger, rounds it up.

* Changing 47 to 50 yields a larger number.


If any of these zeros are on the right of the decimal point, they are not written.
* Rounding 3.7238 could change it to 3.724

== To place value ==

Many times rounding is done to a stated place value.  This is accomplished by;
* finding the appropriate place,
* looking one place to the right and deciding whether or not to add one,
* changing all the digits to the right to zeros and deciding whether to write the zeros.

=== Whole numbers ===

Round 47,268 to the hundreds place.
: Find the 2 in the hundreds place.
: Look at the 6.  It is 5 or larger.  Thus add 1 to the 2.
: Write the digits to the left with no change, those to the right as zeros.
:: 47,268 rounded to the hundreds place is 47,300


Round 41,579,243 to the ten millions place.
: Find the 4 in the ten millions place.
: Look at the 1.  It is smaller than 5.  Thus do not add 1 to the 4.
: Write the digits to the left with no change, those to the right as zeros.
:: 41,579,243 rounded to the ten millions place is 40,000,000

=== Decimals ===

Round 7.3158 to the hundredths place.
: Find the 1 in the hundredths place.
: Look at the 5.  It is 5 or larger.  Thus add 1 to the 1.
: Write the digits to the left with no change, those to the right are not written.
:: 7.3158 rounded to the hundredths place is 7.32


Round 0.003961 to the ten thousandths place.
: Find the 9 in the ten thousandths place.
: Look at the 6.  It is 5 or larger.  Thus add 1 to the 9.  But 9 + 1 is 10.  Think 39 + 1 is 40.  This zero is needed because it is in the place that was rounded to.
: The 6 and 1 are changed to zero but not written.
:: 0.003961 to the ten thousandths place is 0.0040

== To significance==
Sometimes rounding is done to a number of significant digits.
Significant digits are those that are not zeros, and the zeros that have non-zero digits on both sides.
: 230,000 has 2 significant digits (2 and 3.)
: 0.00592 has 3 significant digits (5, 9 and 2.)
: 3.142 has 4 significant digits (3, 1, 4 and 2.)
: 50,900 has 3 significant digits.  The zero in the thousands place has non-zero digits on both sides.
: 0.00420086 has 6 significant digits.  The zeros in the hundred thousandths and millionths places have non-zero digits both to the left and to the right.

When rounding to a stated number of significant digits, the ''most significant digits'' are used.  These are the significant digits that are the farthest to the left.



Round 432,749 to 2 significant digits.
: The 4 and 3 are the most significant digits.
: Look at the 2.  It is small.  Do not add.
: Change the digits to the right to zeros.
:: 432,749 rounded to 2 significant digits is 430,000.


Round 68.251 to 3 significant digits.
: The 6, 8 and 2 are the most significant digits.
: Look at the 5.  It is large.  Add 1 onto 2.
: Do not write the digits to the right.
:: 68.251 rounded to 3 significant digits is 68.3


Round 0.008627 to 1 significant digit.
: The 8 is the most significant digit.
: Look at the 6.  It is small.  Add 1 onto 8.

;'''Adding details'''
Having the game include small, even if repetitive details will provide a richer experience, be it a gush of wind, a dust mote, flies over a trashcan, a leaf floating in the wind can be as powerful a more complex effects like dynamic lighting.

==== Water ====
Water is probably the most difficult effect to reproduce in a game, it includes reflections, transparencies and distortions, high details as waves, foam and is a fluid, behaving like a solid and liquid, so depending on the level of detail that ones is aiming for this will become not only a difficult task but will also consume a lot of computational power if done in real-time.

=== Sound ===
For this part of our engine we are going to be using the OpenAL API. Why? For the simple reasons outlined in Choosing an API; It is open-source, cross-platform and powerful while still remaining relatively easy to use. So lets get started...

All objects that can emit sound in our game world have a position (with the exception of background music). Also associated with the sound is some sort of trigger event, so when the player does something to activate the trigger the sound will start to play. Simple hey! So now how are we actually going to implement this? 

Well, OpenAL works on the concept of having a '''source'''(the sound that plays) and a '''listener'''(the person listening), these two objects can be placed anywhere in our 3D environment and given certain properties such as what attenuation model to use, what speed the source is traveling at etc, but we'll get onto that later. You can also have many sources (which makes sense), but only ONE listener (which also makes sense). When you add a sound for OpenAL to play with you first have to do three things; you create a buffer which you use to load your audio data into, you then create a source and then you associate the source with the buffer so that OpenAL knows what audio to play from which source. So taking all that into account we are going to encapsulate each source into a C++ struct. The struct so far, which we will call '''newSource''', will hold the sources positional information as '''sourcePos[3]''', a '''sourceID''' and a '''bufferID''' so that we can uniquely address each source.

Something else we need to take into consideration is that since OpenAL very kindly attenuates sound for us based on distance we need to make the sound start playing when the player reaches the 'outer bounds' of the source (the point at which you can no longer hear the sound play). So well add in an '''activateDistance''' value to our struct as well.

Additionally, we need to take into consideration that sound data cannot load instantaneously from the hard drive since hard drives are pretty slow things in comparison to RAM. So we'll add a '''preloadDistance''' value to our struct as well so that when we move within that value the sound will load into the buffer and when we move within the '''activateDistance''' value the sound will start to play. Cool hey!

And finally, since we are most probably going to have more than one source (would be a pretty boring game if we did not) we are going to shove our structs into a C++ vector (if you do not know what that is, it is just an array but with more functionality) which we will call '''pipeline'''. We also need to add some functionality to remove 'dead' sources from the pipeline and free up memory, but well get onto this later on.

To illustrate how all this fits together.

And this one illustrates an 'in-game' view of how '''preloadDistance''', '''activateDistance''' and '''sourcePos''' fit into the picture.

So, to outline the process:

* When the player moves within the outer red sphere a new '''newSource''' struct is created, the sound is loaded into the buffer and pushed onto the '''pipeline'''. 

* When the player moves within the yellow sphere the sound starts playing and as the player moves closer towards the inner white sphere the sound will get louder until it reaches maximum volume at the white sphere. 

* Going in reverse, as the player moves away from the white sphere the sound will decrease in volume until you move outside the yellow sphere at which point the sound switches off but remains in the '''pipeline'''.

* When the player exits the red sphere the source is removed from the '''pipeline''' and destroyed (culled) so that we do not take up unnecessary memory.

[[File:Pepperoni pizza.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Pepperoni pizza]]
'''Pizza''' generally consists of a crust covered in sauce, layered with toppings and finally with a layer of cheese on top.

==Crust==

A pizza's crust can be made using almost any [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]] or [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] recipe. [[Cookbook:Flour|White flour]] is commonly used for a soft crust that won't crumble, which is usually considered desirable. [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat Flour|Whole wheat]] flour can be used to make a firmer crust. [[Cookbook:Cake Flour|Cake flour]] can be useful if a crumbly crust is desired. Other common ingredients in crusts include [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]] (usually extra virgin), active dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]], [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]. Less often crusts will include ingredients like malt-syrup, vital wheat gluten, and various dough activators to help the yeast ferment and the crust to brown while baking. What type of crust to use is matter of taste.

There are several types of pizza crust that are constructed differently and have (sometimes) wildly different textures, though the taste remains fairly consistent. The most common styles are Neapolitan, thin, New York-style, deep dish, Sicilian, and pan pizza crust.

There are many different techniques for preparing dough, most largely dependent on the type of crust you've decided to make. Because pizza crusts almost always contain yeast they must be allowed to rise at least once, though some recipes recommend improving the flavor and texture of the dough by allowing the crust to rise 2 separate times. Higher quality recipes also often recommend that you deflate the dough after the first rise and refrigerate it overnight to help improve its flavor and texture. Depending on the recipe dough docking or pre-baking might be necessary as well.

*[[Cookbook:Original Pizza|thin-crust pizza without precooking the crust]]
*[[Cookbook:Deep Dish Pizza|deep dish pizza]]

==Sauce==
A simple [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauce]] consists of [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], and [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]]. Using [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato puree]] will give a runny sauce that must be spread thinly to prevent the cheese and toppings from sliding off. Diced, dried, or crushed [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] may be added for extra flavor and texture. A tiny bit of [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]] or [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] can make the sauce more interesting. [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]], [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|pepper]], [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|peppers]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], and [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] are often used as well. [[Cookbook:Herbs and Spices|Spices]] are more flavorful when ground right before use; a bit of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] is helpful when grinding.

[[Cookbook:Bread|Bread]] with cheese baked onto it, without any [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauce]] at all, is sometimes called a white pizza.

*[[Cookbook:Pizza Sauce|a pair of sauce recipes]]
*''(another sauce recipe belongs here; the one above should be split)''

==Cheese==
The basic pizza cheese is [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella]]. [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|Feta]] is often used in combination with a [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] topping. [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Cheddar]] can be used for a more [[Cookbook:Southwestern cuisine|southwestern]] taste.

Commercial pizzerias almost always use a blend of various cheeses, the most common of which are mozzarella, Parmesan, and Romano.

==Toppings==
Toppings go on top. Put plenty of topping near the edges to protect the cheese from burning there. A pizza without toppings will cook much faster than one with toppings.

* [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovies]]
* oil-coated [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]
* [[Cookbook:Black Olive|black olives]]
* [[Cookbook:Pepperoni|pepperoni]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|green peppers]]
* precooked and drained [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]], [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburger]], [[Cookbook:Salami|salami]], or [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* precooked [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]]

== Baking ==

Pizzas are typically baked directly on special surfaces for short periods at temperatures in excess of 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).

Coal and brick ovens are preferred for baking pizza because of their even heat and superior heat-retention. Some pizzerias prefer to use a wire-mesh pan though, as working with pizza peels can be difficult for some.

Home bakers can attempt to duplicate the effects of a brick oven by using a baking stone (also called a pizza stone), a slab of porous stone that evenly heats the pizza and leeches moisture away from the dough, helping it develop a better crust. Baking/pizza stones become &quot;seasoned&quot; after frequent use, a characteristic that is said to improve the flavor of crusts baked on them.

=== Definitions ===
''' Composite '''

:A composite is a whole number that is not a prime. The number 1 is not composite.

''' Coprimes '''

:Two numbers are coprimes if their greatest common divisor (gcd) equals 1.

''' Diophantine Equation (linear) '''

:An equation of the form ''ax'' + ''by'' = ''c''. Where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are integer constants, and ''x'' and ''y'' are unknown integers.

''' Factorisation '''

:Alternatively spelt factorization. A process in which the prime factors of a natural number are found and the number expressed as the product of the individual factors.

''' gcd (greatest common divisor) '''

:The gcd of ''a'' and ''b'' is a number ''d'', such that ''d'' divides ''a'' and ''d'' divides ''b''; and that if ''e'' divides ''a'' and ''b'', then ''e'' &amp;le; ''d''.

''' Inverse '''

:In modular ''m'' arithmetic, the inverse of ''a'' is the number ''b'' such that
::&lt;math&gt;ab \equiv 1 \pmod{m} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:the inverse is unique. Not every number in every arithmetic have an inverse.

''' Modular arithmetic '''

:The arithmetic modulo ''m'' is the arithmetic where each number is represent by a number lying between 0 and m - 1. E.g. consider modulo 7 arithmetic, 11 is represented by 4; and -2 is represented by 5. We say 11 is equivalent to 4 mod 7; and -2 is equivalent to 5 mod 7. It is explained in more detail [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic here].

''' Prime '''

:A prime number (or prime for short) is a whole number that can only be wholly divided by two different numbers, 1 and itself. The number 1 is thus not considered prime.  We do not consider the negative numbers in this chapter.


----

=== Theorems ===
''' Chinese Remainder Theoren '''

In a system of ''n'' congruencies
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_1 \pmod{ m_1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_2 \pmod{ m_2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:...
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_n \pmod{ m_n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
, a solution exists if and only if for i and j with i &amp;ne; j
:gcd(m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,m&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;) divides (a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)

''' Existence of inverse '''

:In modular ''m'' arithmetic, ''a'' has an inverse if and only if gcd(''a'',''m'') = 1.

''' Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic '''

:Any integer (except for 1) can be expressed as the product of primes in one and only one way. 

''' Infinitely many primes '''

:There are infinitely many primes.</text>

== Coding issues ==

While UTF8 is gradually becoming more common as the code/encapsulation for Japanese emails, the most common coding is still ISO-2022-JP (known in the past as JIS). If you  go to the Setting menu, set the &quot;Gmail display language&quot; to Japanese, then go to the bottom of the menu and set the &quot;Outgoing message encoding&quot; to the upper option (Use default text encoding), emails will be in ISO-2022-JP. 

In general it is best to use ISO-2022-JP for Japanese emails, as this can be handled by most mail clients; even old ones. Gmail sends UTF8-coded emails in a Base64 block, which is gibberish to older non-MIME mail clients.

== Words ==
I tried to use Japanese in Gmail to immerse myself. However I found out that only most of the katakana made sense for me :). I thought that the kanjis in Gmail forms a subset of kanjis found in computing, so I thought this guide can also be useful as a specific kanji list. I'm sorry that right now I can only give meaning to the words in katakana. [[User:Agro1986|Agro1986]] 07:49, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
: Almost all these words are used by most email clients and are not specific to Gmail. Should we be making a general email guide?
: I went ahead and filled in the readings and meanings. For the individual kanji, I just added the 'on' reading so they'll be easier to look up. I don't use Gmail, so I wasn't sure what to make of the &quot;introduce a friend to Gmail&quot; vocab. Maybe 紹介(introduce) should be reworded using &quot;invite&quot; or &quot;invitation&quot; here. Feel free to fix the translations up. You could probably get away with just copying the button names from English Gmail.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}

Templates on this page are used to feature links to other books, wikis, websites, etc. that should stand out for some reason.

== Standard ==

A good place to put these are in some &quot;Further reading&quot; type page in a book, the main page of a book and/or on related [[Subject:Major Subjects|subject]] pages.

== Generic links ==

These are generic templates. For example, if there is no template to link to categories at MetaWiki, one can use this. One can also use [[Template:Sister]] to easily create more standard templates, like {{tl|wikisource}} from above.

== Page navigation ==
The MediaWiki software automatically generates a table of contents on pages with several sections. These appear by default right before the first section. Floating these to either side is easy to do using HTML markup, but to simplify matters further Wikibookians can use these templates to automatically generate the necessary code.

The &quot;compact&quot; templates work on pages that have sections with single, upper-case characters.

== Book navigation ==

: ''See [[:Category:Navigational templates]] for a more extensive list.''

While wikibooks are not made of paper, many are read in a linear fashion. Sometimes books create their own navigation templates, but these are a great starting point for creating a link between pages.

{| style=&quot;width: 100%; border:#aaaaaa solid 1px;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5px&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;

See [[Using Wikibooks/Subjects, Categories, and Classifications]] for {{tl|BookCat}} and other templates that help make the entire book more visible to potential contributors.

'''Notes'''
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;* Obviously, celluloid can't be measured absolutely in these terms.  These estimates provide an interesting comparison to the electronic formats. &lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;** Some people may object to these cameras being called &quot;HD Cameras&quot; and may prefer terms such as &quot;Film-style cameras&quot;. &lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;* Constant bitrate unless otherwise stated&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;** b/p/c = bits per pixel per colour channel&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;*** Obviously, these analogue formats can't be measured absolutely in these terms.  These estimates provide an interesting comparison to the electronic formats. &lt;/nowiki&gt;

''Note that wikipedia has some excellent articles on celluloid that we should not try to replicate, instead we should point to these articles''

How celluloid works

* [[w:Super 8mm film|Super 8mm Film]]
* [[w:16mm film|16mm Film]]
* [[w:35mm film|35mm Film]]
* [[w:70mm film|70mm Film]]

==2 perf 35mm==

For a general description of 2-perf 35mm, see here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-perf_pulldown#2-perf

===Suppliers of 2-perf cameras===

* [http://www.solidentertainment.se/filmequipment_cameras.html Solid Entertainment] (based in Malmo in Southern Sweden)
* Mark Hope-Jones, mhope-jones@arrimedia.com (London, UK)

===Costs===

GBP:

 footage per minute:
 1min @ 25fps on 4-perf 35mm = 93.8ft
 1min @ 25fps on 2-perf 35mm = 46.2ft
 1min @ 25fps on s16mm = 37.5ft
 
 stock costs (new):
 400ft of 35mm 5218 (Kodak Vision2 500T) = £142.80
 400ft of 16mm 7218 (Kodak Vision2 500T) =  £80.33
 
 developing (Technicolor):
 16mm = 9p/foot
 35mm = 11.5p/foot
 
 So, the total costs per minute for stock + dev @ 25fps: 
 
 4-perf 35mm = £44.27
 2-perf 35mm = £21.81
 super-16mm  = £10.91

==Uncompressed==
* Post production is often done uncompressed
* It's now becomming possible to capture uncompressed, too

===Preface: data versus video===
Formats like 2k and 4k are considered &quot;data&quot; rather than &quot;video&quot;.  A scanner which produce 2k files from film negative are called &quot;data scanners&quot; as apposed to &quot;telecines&quot;.  Why?  The main difference between &quot;data&quot; and &quot;video&quot; is that &quot;data&quot; doesn't use any [[w:Chroma subsampling|chroma subsampling]] and is always [[w:RGB|RGB]] (as apposed to a video [[w:Color space|colour space]] like [[w:YUV|YUV]]).  I.E. data is always 4:4:4 RGB.

===Advantages of using uncompressed===
* No compression artifacts
* Maintain full latitude (useful if the footage will be graded)
* Very little processing required

===Disadvantages of using uncompressed===
* Requires lots of storage
* Requires very fast hard disk

===Uncompressed formats===

* HD &lt;= 1920x1080
* 2k = 2048x1556
* 4k = 
* 6k =
* 8k =

see [[Movie Making Manual/Cinematography/Cameras and Formats/Table of Formats|Table of Formats]] for more details.

==Film style electronic cameras==

===Viper===

===Arri D-20===
* 1920x1080

===Panavision Genesis===
* 1920x1080

====Films made with the Genesis====
* Scary Movie 4
* Superman Returns

===Kinetta===

===Dalsa Origin===
* 12-stops lattitude
* 4k resolution

==Direct to Disk Recording (DDR)==

===Hard disks for use with DV cameras===
* Formax Oxygen (250GB hard disk, good value for money, plugs into a DV camera)
* FireStore
* DVRack software turns a laptop into a hard disk recorder and [[Movie Making Manual/Monitoring and Measuring Exposure|monitoring]] system

===Hard disks for the JVC GY-HD100 HDV camera===
* JVC DR-HD100 recorder records audio, timecode, video, all over firewire.  40 and 80GB capacities for &gt;3 and &gt;7 hrs of HDV recording.
** HD or SD recording
** SD DV25 as .dv, AVI type 1 or 2, 2 type 24p, QuickTime 30i or 24p (and other AVI formats as well for Matrox etc.), in HD it records 720p24, p25, p30 .m2t files for NLE systems

===Hard disks for the Panasonic HVX200 DVCproHD camera===
* Focus DTE FS100DTE

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}

== Notices ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;
! Markup !! Display
|-
| {{tlx|wrongtitle|&lt;nowiki&gt;title=Title&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
| {{wrongtitle|title=Title|example=yes}}
|}

There is also the {{tl|incomplete}} template. While there may be justified usages for this, be advised against using it whenever text should be expanded on. Be specific in what is lacking to make collaboration easier and inform readers. Maybe you are looking for {{tl|TODO}} or one of the templates listed on [[Help:Stub]]. Some wikibooks have book-specific to-do templates such as {{tl|Japanese todo}}.

The {{tl|spoiler}} and {{tl|endspoiler}} templates came with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] from Wikipedia. While there was a case for using it there (encyclopaedia articles contain various information and some are looking for general information but others synopses) try to do without in your wikibooks. Place spoiling content in separate modules and alert readers before they go there.

== Page details ==
The {{tlx|Displaytitle}} template can set the page title and tab. The former is useful for modifying page titles to something not possible due to technical limitations. The latter is used in the [[Cookbook]] to differentiate between recipes and ingredients. See the template page for documentation.

== Text boxes ==
=== Generic text boxes ===
These text box templates are used to set aside a block of text from the rest of the page.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;
! Markup !! Display
|-
| {{tlx|SideBox|Text}}
*Floats on the right
*Text is centered
*250px wide
| {{SideBox|Text}}
|-
| {{tlx|SideBox|float{{=}}left|Text}}
*Floats on the left
*Text is centered
*250px wide
| {{SideBox|float=left|Text}}
|-
| {{tlx|LeftHalf|Text}}
*Floats on left
*50% of screen width
| {{LeftHalf|Text}}
|-
| {{tlx|RightHalf|Text}}
*Floats on right
*50% of screen width
| {{RightHalf|Text}}
|-
| {{tlx|TextBox|Text}}
*90% of screen width
| {{TextBox|Text}}
|-
| {{tlx|DropBox|Caption|Text}}
*Same format as previous text boxes, but can be shown or hidden
*Adjustable width/floating (see examples at [[Template:DropBox]])
| {{DropBox|Caption|Text}}
|-
| {{tlx|Body note|a short text in the body text}}
| A paragraph {{body note|a short text in the body}} A paragraph of main text
|-
| {{tlx|Side note|a short text on left}}
| {{side note|a short text on left}} A paragraph of main text
|-
| {{tlx|Side note|side&amp;#61;right|a short text on right}}
| {{Side note|side=right|a short text on right}} A paragraph of main text
|}

=== Formatted text boxes ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%&quot;
 ! style=&quot;width:50%&quot; | Markup !! Display
 |-
 | {{tlx|message box|&lt;nowiki&gt;heading=You should contribute to Wikibooks.|message=Wikibooks is a collection of free textbooks that anyone can edit.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 | {{message box|heading=You should contribute to Wikibooks.|message=Wikibooks is a collection of free textbooks that anyone can edit.}}
 |-
 | {{tlx|message box|&lt;nowiki&gt;image=stop_hand.png|alt=stop sign|backgroundcolor=yellow|heading=You can change the image and background color.|message=This template has optional parameters.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 | {{message box| image=stop_hand.svg | alt=stop sign| backgroundcolor=yellow| heading=You can change the image and background color.| message=This template has optional parameters.}}
 |}

=== Special text boxes ===
These templates make it easy to quickly add formatting to your Wikibooks. Should you wish to modify them, please try not to do so in a backwards incompatible fashion as they are used across a number of different books.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
 ! style=&quot;width:50%;&quot; | Markup !! Display
 |-
 | {{tlx|Example|example text}}
 | {{Example|example text}}
 |-
 | {{tlx|Proof|proof text}}
 | {{Proof|proof text}}
 |-
 | {{tlx|Helpful hint|hint=Give a hint here}}
 | {{Helpful hint|hint=Give a hint here}}
 |-
 | {{tlx|Warning|warning text}}
 | {{Warning|warning text}}
 |-
 | {{tlx|Yellow Warning|warning text}}
 | {{Yellow Warning|warning text}}
 |-
 | {{tlx|Info|information}}
 | {{Info|information}}
 |-
 | {{tlx|Sample|&lt;nowiki&gt;caption=Caption|sampletext=Some sample text.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
 | {{Sample|caption=Caption|sampletext=Some sample text.}}
 |}

=== Software Versions ===
Many books are instructional manuals on computer software. It is important to clearly convey which version of the software the book refers to.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
 ! style=&quot;width:30%;&quot; | Markup !! Display
 |-
 | {{tlx|Software header|name&amp;#61;software|version&amp;#61;number|type&amp;#61;&gt;}} &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''See [[Template:Software header|template page]] for more usage information.&lt;/small&gt;
 | {{Software header|name=software|version=number|type=&gt;}}
 |-
 | {{tlx|Software sidebox|name&amp;#61;software|version&amp;#61; number|type&amp;#61;&lt;}}
 | {{Software sidebox|name=software|version=number|type=&lt;}}
 |}

      <text xml:space="preserve">CAT means &quot;Computer Aided Translation&quot;, referring not to machine translation, but to translation done by human translators with specialized software providing functions to increase workflow while providing quality assurance, glossaries and other assistance. 

Wikibooks was chosen for these manuals to be written by translators for translators to make sure the content is open to the public and subject to a continuous quality improvement. Wikibooks also allows FAQs and other useful informational tools.

Expanding this to other languages would of course be welcome. If you see something that should be improved, please jump in. Every bit that improves this content is helpful to everyone else who reads it. It is hoped comparative pages will be added to provide guidance among different CAT programs.

== Contents ==
&lt;!-- NOTE: Please add every new page on this page starting with a '''/'''. This assures that single pages are automatically created as subpages of the current page. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The DVX Editor is the standard evaluation version of the program, but instead of requesting an evaluation code for 30 days, the user should ask for an &quot;Editor code&quot;. These codes are permanent. As for the download please refer to http://www.atril.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Quotes on Writing ~  

I watched her craft with words, her keyboard a palate. Deftly she colored the image, her bold strokes painting hues of mood and thought. I imagined her sitting back to admire her work, head turned to the side, like O'Keeffe, finished with an orchid. -- Billye Belden about Marsha Steed

Jay's saying for the day: 
'Spend less time thinking about what you could be writing, and more time writing about what your thinking,' 

&quot;We all lie exposed to the world or ourselves. It can be both exhilarating and terrifying. Still we bare all for hope, for the chance of finding Soul. Written tapestries cover us like quilted renewal, offering security and safety to the soul beneath as it awaits, wanting wings, but oft times daring not to fly.&quot; -- Sharaya Kai

Writing 1
 
Write, my note says.  Write.  The cursor blinks at me tauntingly.  Write!  it says, Write!  it dares me, as if I had something significant to say.  As if my words should somehow be immortalized.  Who do I think I am, to offer up my thoughts as somehow worthy of record.  Who is anyone?  People have been writing since they discovered they could.  Civilization rests on the ability to preserve other ideas and thoughts considered important.  Writing then, is intrinsic to human nature.   
 
Yet... why me?  I am merely a woman like any other, and still, I am pressed, cajoled by the black against white, the thoughts that seem to prick at me and insist that I express them.  Even then, the mere expression isn't enough.  Writers need an audience.  Someone to read what they write.  Some will tell you that they don't need it.  That the writing is enough, and yet they will eventually show someone.  Unless it is a Journal.  Often that is indeed only for themselves.  Poetry sometimes needs no reader to be lifeblood.  Sometimes it is enough to express what is heaped up inside upon something tangible as paper or pixels.  However, most writing was written, not to be closeted in some dark jar for millions of years, but to be read.  Yet then, the reading isn't enough.  Writers want to know what is thought.  Thoughts are sinew and bone to the framework of a writers craft.  They wish to know what the writing inspired, if it expressed what it was meant to, or if it did not, what thoughts it did inspire.   
 
If it was poorly crafted, or brilliantly on the mark, writers hunger for the answers.  'It was lovely'... is about as helpful as , 'It stunk'.  Neither assist in the betterment of the piece, and both are like watered down soup, broth to a starving man.   
 
If you will tell me something, tell me how you feel.  Tell me what you thought, tell me you thought nothing, but tell me.  For I am... a writer.  
 
---&lt;--{@ Marsha Steed ' 8/2k

MAKING THIS BOOK—
I would seriously like to make this book a reality. The written word is one of humanities greatest achivements. Ill be workin on it, please add whatever you can.
-Basejumper123

I would be interested in contributing something.  It seems like a promising wikibook.  I don't have much time on my hands, and I'm not a very good writer, but I would be willing to do a bit of research.  Please feel free to say hello on my talk page.

== Disappointed in style ==
I think the way this book is written should change. It looks a little too disorganized. (no offense intended) For one thing it does not take fully into account the full history of language. Written word has been around since the ancient Sumerians. Heck, you could write another book on the history of language. 
I suggest:
* Intro
* History
** Ancient Sumer-0 AD
*** Sections under ancient
** Modern 0 AD-Present
*** Sections under modern
* Writing
**Writing exercises
*** Beginner
***Intermediate
*** Advanced
** Fiction
*** Genres under fiction
** Nonfiction
*** Genres under non-fiction
** Historical Fiction
* Summary

      <text xml:space="preserve">Open the file with word (after having created a copy) and then go to the macro-section; there you will find a macro called:

tw4winClean.Main

Execute this macro to delete the original text and the Trados-tags.
There is no need to have Trados Workbench open to execute the macro.

Further question to that theme by LES:&lt;br&gt;
But why would someone want to do that?&lt;br&gt;
--&gt; Sometimes it happens that Trados just won't clean up your document with its normal routine - so you can do it manually. This happens quite frequently with huge files. So it's a workaround and should always be done with a copy of the file. Attention: it does NOT update the TM.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is the sequencer? ==
When I first began using blender, I assumed it was basically a 3D modeling and animation program, but what I didn't know is that it also included a fairly powerful non-linear video editor. With the sequencer you can take your rendered animations and splice them together, chop them apart, add pretty effects, and do all sorts of fun things that most people would go perform in a completely different application... But we're using Blender, so forget about those other programs.

== Why use the sequencer? ==
The sequencer adds a lot of flexibility to your rendering process, using the sequencer you can basically render the same animation as many times as you'd like from different camera angles, and then load the animations back into the Sequence editor and cut 'n' splice them as you desire. You can achieve some nice effects such as blurring that would probably be less efficient if performed during rendering, also an important feature is the ability to add sound clips to your animations. The sequencer also allows you to layer multiple Blender Scenes, which can lead to some very interesting results.

Another feature is the ability to render out sequences in the same renderfarm that you might have set up for rendering the animations.

== Prerequisites == 
The reason this section is near the end of the wikibook, is probably because in order to get any real use out of the Sequencer you'll probably already want to know how to do basic animation and modeling in blender, if you feel fairly comfortable with those subjects, then let's get started on the next page!

==Introduction==

===Overview===

This manual is a work in progress. It is subject to the following language availability:

Language - Status 
Belorussian (be) - Version 1.4.4; update pending
English (en) - Version 1.4.6 (current)
Esperanto (eo) - Version 1.4.4; update pending
French (fr) - Version 1.4.4; update pending
German (de) - New version pending
Italian (it) - New version pending
Japanese (ja) - Version 1.4.4; update pending
Spanish (es) - Version 1.4.4; update pending
Russian (ru) - Version 1.4.4; update pending
Turkish (tr) - New version pending

The two letters in parentheses following the language are the language code for that language.

See the localization section in the credits below for the party responsible for a particular language.

OmegaT is a cross-platform application, so we decided to use UNIX/Linux terminology as it seems to be more common in cross-platform world. This documentation is intended for OmegaT users on all platforms, but some terminology could be a little unfamiliar to Windows users. So when the UNIX/Linux forward slash '/' is encountered, think '\'; and when “directory” is read, mentally translate it to “folder” instead.

For further information above and beyond what is contained in this manual please visit the OmegaT home page at http://www.omegat.org. Should you have any questions or comments on the manual please send them to the author (email: lin4trans@users.sourceforge.net with the subject line &quot;OmegaT documentation&quot;). Feedback is welcome!
What is a Translation Memory?

The term &quot;translation memory&quot; is often used to refer to a program that works with a translation memory and an actual translation memory. So there is a need to differentiate between these uses in practice. A translation memory program, a '''Computer Assisted Translation (CAT)''' tool, is used during the translation of documents from one language to another. It assists translation by storing pieces of text in a database (i.e. the translation memory) so that when the same piece of text (a segment) or a part of it is next encountered it is immediately visible as to how it was translated in the past. In order for translation memory to be very useful it must be used on a large number of document segments to build up a database of sufficient size with the corresponding translations; or sufficiently large pre-made databases must be available.

===What is special about OmegaT?===

There are many translation memory programs on the market. OmegaT's particular features include that it is:

:* '''platform independent'''; uses a Java Runtime Environment for operation, and so can be used on a number of different operating systems including: Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows;
:* '''free''';
:* '''open-source software''', which means that users are free to distribute and modify it;
:* distributed with '''OpenDocument/OpenOffice.org file format support'''.
:* productive in '''website localization of XHMTL or HTML files'''.
:* useful for '''software localization of Java programs'''.

==System Requirements==

OmegaT requires a Java Runtime Environment (also known as JRE). Essentially, if your system will run Java programs it will run OmegaT. Java Runtime Environments are available for the following platforms: Windows 95/98/2000/ME/XP, UNIX, Linux, and Solaris (both x86 and Sun SPARC). Mac OS X comes with one pre-installed.

This OmegaT release requires a JRE version of 1.4 or higher, and we recommend using at least version 1.4.2 for it is the most stable out of 1.4.x JREs.

As far as the OmegaT project team is aware, OmegaT does NOT run on the following platforms:

:* Windows NT; the NT Java implementation contains bugs
:* Mac OS 9; the only Java Runtime Environment available for it (known as MRJ) does not offer the required functionality.

==Installation and Configuration==

===Installation===

Installation involves three stages:

#Java Installation (if not already installed)
#OmegaT Installation
#OmegaT Configuration (UNIX/optional)

Java and OmegaT can be installed in any order. Configuration is not essential on UNIX based platforms, but it will make launching the application more user-friendly for those that require it.


====Java Installation====

The computer being used to run OmegaT must have a Java Runtime Environment(JRE) installed on it--IT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT ONE INSTALLED!

If uncertain as to whether or not a JRE is installed, install OmegaT first and then test to see if it works (see OmegaT Installation). If nothing happens, or error messages are returned, the Java Runtime Environment is almost certainly not installed. In which case, please obtain one and install it first.

Please note that JRE is available in the form of both a standalone product (J2RE) or as part of the Java Software Developer's Kit(J2SDK).

Mac users: On Mac OS X, a JRE is pre-installed and configured. This is the only platform that does not require the user to install a JRE. Depending upon the OS X version installed, an old JRE version may be the only one available. If OmegaT does not work, make sure to run Software Update from the Apple Menu to get the latest JRE available for the OS X version. OmegaT is known to work on OS X from OS X 10.2 to the most recent OS X 10.3.9 update. It has not yet been tested on OS X 10.4 but should work too. In case the system has been updated to OS X 10.3.9 and problems occur, be aware that a special update is necessary to make Java application run on this OS X version. Run Software Update and install the required package. Earlier versions of OmegaT (namely 0.97) are known to run on the MRJ for Macintosh OS 9. OmegaT version 1.4 or greater will not run on this platform. To run an OmegaT 0.97 version, download the MRJ for Mac OS9 from the Apple website at http://www.apple.com. OmegaT 0.97 is an obsolete version and this documentation makes no further reference to it.

UNIX users (includes Linux &amp; Solaris): type java -version at a command prompt in a console or terminal program. The version installed will be returned(if Java is installed as an executeable in your shell path).

Windows users: check which version of JRE, if any, is installed with Start(button)/Windows key &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel. If a JRE is already installed, a control panel dialog labelled &quot;Java(TM)2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition 1.x.y_z” or similar (with x, y, z representing some version numbers) will be present. Note that OmegaT cannot be used on any version before Windows 98 due to the fact that the JREs available on that platform are not recent enough.

For both UNIX and Windows, please note that as of this writing the current Java version is in the 1.5 range (stable version). Please upgrade to a newer version if it is not very recent. A J2RE or J2SDK can be downloaded from the links below. They are free (note the license conditions), but the naming conventions may make finding the right version a little confusing. The correct version for a particular platform (Linux, Solaris, Windows, etc.) is mandatory. The download size and final installation disk space required for a JRE should be taken into consideration before proceeding. The download sizes are approximately 14 MB and 32 MB, for J2RE and J2SDK, respectively. Required disk space for installation may be as much as 2 to 3 times larger than the downloaded installation file or package.

1.4.x versions of OmegaT should work with any JRE version from 1.2 upwards. However, it is recommended to have the latest JRE version installed, older versions of Java may not support certain features.

As an alternative to J2RE the J2SDK can be installed. The J2SDK developer's kit contains its own copy of J2RE, as well as support for Java software development.

UNIX and Windows users can download the Java Runtime Environment from:

Sun (all platforms) at http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html

Blackdown (Linux) at http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html

Installation instructions for JRE can be found on the website where it is downloaded from or accompanying the downloaded file or package once it has been opened or unarchived.
Important Notes:

Sun regularly changes the names of its products--possibly to confuse its customers. So, all JRE above version 1 are known as Java 2, hence the Java Runtime Environment is now J2RE. The Java Runtime Environment is also known as the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM. On Macintosh, it also is known as the MRJ. The developer's kit has been known as the Java Developer's Kit(JDK), Software Developer's Kit(SDK), and now as J2SE, J2EE, and J2ME, according to the version. At least, I think so. But I am among the confused.

Other related (or not so related) forms of Java exist:

    * Java for embedded web browser applications (i.e. via plugins);
    * JavaScript scripting language for webpages (technically unrelated to Java).

Neither of these forms of Java will enable OmegaT to run.


'''&lt;big&gt;OmegaT Installation&lt;/big&gt;'''

All Platforms

A generic OmegaT archive is available for installation. This version of OmegaT works on Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows (and possibly others). See System Requirements also. Simply extract the contents of the archive into a directory. The archive may be in *.zip, *.tgz, or *.tar.bz2 form. UNIX and Mac (Stuffit) users should have no problem with most of these formats; Windows users may not necessarily have a utility for the latter two (recent WinZip versions will probably work with or .tgz file formats; other file compression programs may work also). For more platform specific packages see the relevant sections.
Linux

RPM packages are starting to become available on the sourceforge site.

The RPM should be compatible with all RPM based Linux distributions. By default, the OmegaT package will install itself in the directory /opt/omegat. This is in accord with the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard(FHS) which specifies that all non-essential (non-system related) applications be installed under /opt. If an /opt directory does not exist the installation RPM will create it. Note that system administrator privileges are required to install the package. Contact your system administrator if it cannot be installed. Please note that this differs from the other installation methods in that it is a system-wide installation. As such, each user will have their own OmegaT preferences file in their home directory distinct from all other users. In this way separate users can log in and have their own preferences rather than relying on a single preferences setup for all users.
Mac OS X

OS X users can download a Mac OS X package that automatically installs a Mac OS X bundle into /Applications/. As usual, the final installation directory can be modified if desired.
Windows

Windows users can download a Windows binary installer OmegaT_1.4.x_setup.exe and just run it. In this case, the installer creates a shortcut to launch OmegaT from the Start &gt; Programs menu.
OmegaT Configuration (UNIX only)

If installation on a UNIX based system is done by using the generic archive, and you are not very familiar with the platform, perform the following to make launching of OmegaT more user-friendly:

Save the following Bash shell script content as a text file:
#!/bin/bash
cd &lt;OmegaT&gt;
&lt;java&gt;/java -jar OmegaT.jar

where &lt;OmegaT&gt; is the directory containing the file OmegaT.jar and &lt;java&gt; is the directory containing the J2RE binary (the file named java). If the Java path variable is set, it is not necessary to specify this directory, and java -jar OmegaT.jar is sufficient to launch the program. Specifying the directory is necessary if the Java path variable is not set, and also if the system has more than one version of Java installed and a specific version needs to be used to launch OmegaT.

If Bash is not the default shell program change the first line of the script to reflect this (e.g. for Korn shell use #!/bin/ksh in place of #!/bin/bash )

Save the script as OmegaT, omegat, or under whatever name is preferred. Then set the file permissions of the script to executable (e.g. via $ chmod u+x OmegaT in a shell, or if using Konqueror, context menu &gt; Properties &gt; Permissions &gt; Exec). OmegaT can then be launched from the command line by typing the name given to the script. To launch from the desktop, create an icon and set it to execute the shell script file.
OmegaT Execution
Mac OS X

If the Mac OS X bundle has been installed, simply click on the OmegaT icon located in the install directory. In the case where only the standard Java files have been downloaded and installed, simply click on the OmegaT.jar file in a Finder window. OmegaT can also be launched from the Terminal (in a way similar to the command line under Linux). See the UNIX configuration and execution sections for more information.
UNIX

If a generic archive was used for installation then try these instructions to launch OmegaT. For RPM install under Linux executing OmegaT from a shell is enough to launch the application (no default desktop menu entry is available yet).

Execute java -jar OmegaT.jar from the command line. Observe the exact type case of OmegaT—the capitals are important.

If Java has not been configured to detect the location of the OmegaT files, change directories to the directory containing the file OmegaT.jar.

If the Java path variable is not set, specify the complete path first. If neither of the above have been done, a routine to launch the application might look something like this for installation from the generic archive:
cd /home/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;OmegaT install directory&gt;
&lt;JRE directory&gt;/bin/java -jar OmegaT.jar

for user Joe Blow, archive installation directory OmegaT, and JRE directory
/usr/jre1.5

this would be
cd /home/joeblow/OmegaT
/usr/jre1.5/bin/java -jar OmegaT.jar
Windows

If OmegaT has been installed with the help of the Windows installer (see above), it can be launched by clicking on the OmegaT 1.4.x shortcut from the Start &gt; Programs &gt; OmegaT menu. It is also possible to click on one of the files OmegaT.exe, OmegaT.bat, or OmegaT.jar in the file manager.
Localization

The language used by OmegaT for the user interface and the user manual are set to a default value which depends on your locale and the localizations available. Only the following localizations can be used at present:

    * Belorussian (be)
    * English (en)
    * Esperanto (eo)
    * French (fr)
    * Japanese (ja)
    * Spanish (es)
    * Russian (ru)

If the language desired is not available, the default language will be used. This will default to the system locale, if it is one of the localizations available, or English when nothing else is available.

It is possible to override the default language used by OmegaT by entering the two letter language code, from the list given, to the -Duser.language java option (at the command line or in a shell script). This can be useful when using OmegaT in an environment where the default locale is not supported or is different than the one desired. For instance, starting OmegaT with
java -Duser.language=fr -jar OmegaT.jar

will set the language to French regardless of whether other applications in the windowing environment are in French or not.

More specific locale settings are not supported for the localization of OmegaT at present (i.e. via the -Duser.country and -Duser.variant options passed to java).

Something else to note is the fact that for a language like Japanese it may be necessary to use a specific internationalized version of JRE from Sun to support character encodings properly. This is most likely in the case of Windows installation.
Mac OS X

On Mac OS X, changing the locale can be done from System Preferences in the Apple Menu by selecting the International preference pane. Locales can be added and prioritized according to the way any application should be displayed.

= Getting started =
[[Image:Blender_sequencelayout.png|left|thumb|Figure 1 - a nice layout for sequence editing]]
As you probably know by now, a good window layout in Blender is very important for workflow, Figure 1 provides a good starting layout for Sequencing.

I'll quickly run through the work areas shown in Figure 1, just in case you're unfamiliar with them. Starting at top, going left to right.
* '''IPO Curve Editor''' - set to 'sequence' mode.
* '''Video Sequence Editor''' - with the tiny 'face' icon pressed.
* '''Video Sequence Editor''' - That's right, we've got two of them, I'll explain why in just a moment.
* '''Buttons Window''' - You're probably familiar with this one.

But this is Blender, so you're free to set up your layout however you wish. Now all we need is some media to play with in the sequencer.

== Media preparation ==
[[Image:Blendseq_waveguy.png|left|thumb|Figure 2 - It's waving at you because you look friendly, or it just wants to eat you.]]
For this fairly short example I've created a simple 80 frame animation featuring an asexual humanoid-like thing that waves at you from within Blender, I know it's frightening, but this is for learning purposes. If you view the full sized version of Figure 2, you may notice a few important settings on the button window have been circled.
* ''Output'' - I set the filename to //waveguy so that will be the filename we're looking for when we begin sequence editing.
* ''Frame Range'' - 1 to 80, so we're rendering an 80 frame animation.
* ''Format'' - Notice I've selected a reasonable animation size of '''720x480''', when you render animation clips for sequence editing it's good practice to ''stay consistent with your output resolution'', otherwise you'll end up with funky looking resampling jaggies in the final animation. I also chose '''AVI Jpeg''' since it has a very minimal quality loss and saves a lot of disk space compared to ''AVI Raw'', and is far easier to manage a single AVI file than a huge pile of numbered PNG or JPG images, also blender has no trouble reading this format back in for sequence editing, which is a problem you may run into if you attempt to load some other type of video format directly into blender.
=== Media types ===
You should also know that the Sequencer can handle quite a few different types of content. Here's a rundown:
* '''Audio''' - fairly self explanitory, throw audio clips directly into your sequence, you can also adjust volume and panning. 
* '''Scene''' - include Scenes directly in your sequence, this is extremely useful if you're compositing 3D objects on top of video or pre-rendered backdrops, lightsaber duels, etc.
* '''Image''' - great if you need to key some text over your sequence.
* '''Movie''' - pull in your pre-rendered animations, either numbered image sequences or AVI files.

== Our First Sequence ==
We'll start by loading a clip into the sequence window and then learn how we can manipulate it. From within the sequence window, begin by clicking ''Add'', then ''Movie'', use the file selector to choose our movie file and hit ''Select Movie''.

If the file loaded successfully you should notice a colored bar hovering below your mouse cursor inside the Sequence window. A single click of the left mouse button will drop it down onto the timeline, don't worry if you put it in the wrong spot because you can always move it later by right-clicking the strip and pressing the G key (or just hold RMB and drag), which is probably familiar now that you're becoming a seasoned Blender user.

[[Image:Blenderseq waveguyclip.png|right|thumb|Figure 3 - The clip is visible in the timeline ]]
In Figure 3 the movie strip has been given the name &quot;Wave Guy&quot; by opening up the ''Strip Properties'' mini-window by selecting the strip and pressing the '''N''' key. There's also a couple options in the mini-window such as ''Mul'' which allows you to adjust the brightness of the clip, experiment a little. Also, rolling the mouse wheel adjusts the viewable area of the Sequence window.

If you hold the left mouse button and move the cursor left and right inside the Sequence window you can quickly shuttle around your sequence, notice this also changes the ''current-frame'' adjuster on the Buttons window. As we mentioned earlier, our example window layout contains ''2 Sequence windows'', the difference between them is that one of them has the ''Preview'' button selected ( it looks like a tiny face ), if you have this pressed, you should notice as we shuttle between frames, the preview window will update itself and display our movie clip, it is often a good idea to set your rendering resolution to a lower setting while doing work in the sequencer, you can easily do this by selecting the 50% or 25% buttons located in the ''Render'' mini-window inside the ''Buttons'' window, just be sure to switch it back to 100% before performing your final render.

Now we'll render a single frame of our sequence to see if everything is working properly, shuttle to a position in your sequence where our movie strip should be visible (so the vertical green line is intersecting the movie strip in our timeline), and press '''F12'''. If you don't see your movie, don't be alarm, you probably don't have the ''Do Sequence'' toggle button enabled in your ''Render'' mini-window on the ''Buttons'' window. When this option is enabled, Blender uses your sequence as a rendering source rather than your 3D scene like we're all used to. Enable the button, perform another test render, and your movie clip should be visible.
=== Duplicating the clip ===
Now we'll try duplicating our movie strip and adding an interesting transition effect.

# ''Right click'' the movie strip to select it.
# Press ''Shift-D'' to make a duplicate.
# Move your mouse cursor to place the duplicated movie strip on the line above the original, and also drag it to the right a few frames so it is  offset from the original.

Go ahead and shuttle around again, notice the skip in the animation because when one clip runs out, it switches to the other clip in the Sequence, layers are numbered starting with 1 at the bottom and increase as you go up, ''the lowest layer is always displayed before higher numbered layers, except when the higher layer is an Effect.''

[[Image:Blenderseq waveguyclip2.png|left|thumb|Figure 4 - Two strips, with a ''Cross'' effect between them, notice the effect on the preview.]]
=== Adding a nice transition ===
Next we'll add a ''Cross'' Effect between our two movie strips, this causes a nice dissolve effect from one strip to the other.

# ''Right click'' the strip that comes first in the Sequence.
# ''Hold Control &amp; Right Click'' the second strip, so both strips are selected. ''* note'' - the order in which you select the strips determines which strips our Cross Effect uses as a source and destination. Also, not all Effects require more than 1 strip.
# At the bottom of the Sequence window go to ''Add'', then ''Effect&gt;'', then click ''Cross''.
# A new strip will appear under the mouse cursor, place this above both your movie strips. Notice you cannot change the length of the Effect, only the layer which it is placed, the length of transition effects is determined by the area in which the two related strips overlap each other.

[[Image:Blender hello there rgba.png|right|thumb|Figure 5 - a simple RGBA image made in Gimp, just an example.]]
=== Keying a graphic ===
Our alien-like humanoid is waving at us, so we may as well add some text to the animation that makes sense. When using Blender it's usually a good idea to have a good 2D graphics application within reach for making textures and things, the graphic in Figure 5 was made in Gimp and saved as an RGBA ''(The A stands for Alpha, or Transparency, if you didn't know that)'' PNG.

Next, add the graphic to your current Sequence in the same way you added the movie strip previously. Click ''Add'', then ''Images'', find your image in the file selector and load it. Once again, you should see a differently colored bar hovering under your mouse cursor. This time, place it on the second or third row above our first movie strip. The next step is to use utilize the alpha channel in the image and make it appear above our movie strip. If you haven't figured this out already, you can use the right mouse button to drag the arrows located on either end of the media strips to adjust the number of frames they cover in the Sequence.

[[Image:Blenderseq waveguycliptext1.png|right|thumb|Figure 6 - &quot;Hello There!&quot;, slapping graphics right on top of our Blender animations.]]
We will now add an ''Alpha Under'' Effect using the image and movie strips, this is very similar to what we did previously when adding the ''Cross'' Effect between the two movie strips.

# Select our new image strip ''(Right Mouse Button)''.
# Hold ''Ctrl'' and ''Right Click'' the movie strip below the Image Strip.
# Finally, click ''Add'', then ''Effect&gt;'', and then choose ''Alpha Under'' from the list.
# An Effect strip will appear under the mouse, place it above the Image Strip in the Sequence.

Now shuttle around a bit and notice our text appears above the movie strip in the Sequence preview window as shown in Figure 6.

But you may ask, &quot;What happens when we get so many strips that sequences become unmanagable&quot; or perhaps &quot;But how can I use this Alpha Under effect on a series of movie strips, it seems to only work on one strip at a time?&quot;, and perhaps you didn't ask that, but you're going to get an answer either way.

=== Meta-strips to the rescue ===
Meta-strips add the ability to take a group of strips and smash them into a single strip which we can move, resize, and trim as if it were a single strip, but we keep the ability to enter it at a later time if we need to make changes to its components contained within, or we can expand the meta-strip back into the multiple strips we created it from. Let's get started.

In this step, we'll convert our two movie strips and ''Cross'' effect into a single ''Meta-strip'' so we can apply the ''Alpha Under'' effect to the whole length of our ''Meta-strip'', this feature can be extremely useful and keep Sequences manageable even when they get fairly complex.

Currently, our first movie clip is associated with the ''Alpha Under'' effect so it cannot be part of a Meta-strip without also including that effect, so we will delete the effect ''but not the image strip'', then make our meta-strip, and add the effect back. If it sounds complicated, just take a breath and follow the steps.

# Select the ''Alpha Under'' effect in the sequence, and press '''x''' to delete it.
# Highlight all the strips that will be part of our new Meta-strip, to do this ''Ctrl + Right Click'' each strip we want to add, in this specific case: our first movie strip, the duplicate movie strip, and the ''Cross'' effect strip.
# Once all the strips are selected, press '''m''', a ''Make Meta Strip?'' requester will appear, click ''Ok''.
&lt;small&gt;Alternatively, you can select ''Strip'' from the header, then ''Make Meta Strip'' if you forget the keyboard shortcut.&lt;/small&gt;

[[Image:Blenderseq waveguyclipmeta.png|thumb|right|Figure 7]]

You should now see a very interesting looking strip appear in the place of our three strips. You can press '''n''' and assign our new meta-strip a name if you desire. You may also notice that you can move the meta-strip around the Sequence like any regular strip, you can also add Effects to it, but before we do that, we'll check out a very nice feature of the Meta-strip.

# Select the meta-strip.
# Press '''tab'''.

Notice the background of the sequence editor changes color and we see our original movie strips and ''Cross'' effect. By selecting the Meta-strip and pressing tab, we've essentially entered inside of it and can now make changes to it if we need to, it's probably obvious that this is far superior than rendering out a sequence and then importing it back in as a movie strip to add additional effects to it. Press '''tab''' again to exit the meta-strip. You can also break the meta-strip apart by selecting it and pressing '''Alt + M''', but we don't want to do that now.

Now we'll add our ''Alpha Under'' effect to the &quot;Hello There!&quot; image and our meta strip, this time our graphic can span across the whole length of the meta-strip rather than just over a single movie strip.

# Select the image strip.
# Additionally select the Meta-strip by holding '''ctrl''' while clicking.
# As we did earlier, click ''Add &gt; Effect &gt; Alpha Under''.
# Place the new ''Alpha Under'' effect strip above the image strip.

You can now drag the corners of the image strip as shown to the same length of the meta-strip and our text will be keyed over the length of the whole meta-strip, as shown in Figure 7. This is a very important skill when making complex Sequences in Blender.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Felixpetrar. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Felixpetrar~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

== monolithic versions ==
Hi Panic. I thought you might be interested to see how the [[Computer Science:Data Structures]] book has an [[Computer Science:Data Structures:All Chapters]] view of the book, which gives a monolithic version of the same book. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_Science:Data_Structures:All_Chapters&amp;action=edit As you can see] this is accomplished through transclusion. I've made special _content pages for each chapter, so that way there can be a view of the book that is chapter by chapter with a navigation bar, and a view of the book that is all chapters, without navigation bars. I think it would be a good idea to start doing this for the C++ book, so that the C -/- -/- book won't be necessary. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 21:01, 7 September 2005 (UTC)
== Fork Warning ==
Since this issue has been brought to my attention I have reviewed the
[[Wikibooks:Forking policy|forking policy]]. The separate books [[Programming:C plus plus]] and [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] will be merged into a single book. The monolithic book versus separate chapters conflict shall be resolved by including an All Chapters page that is a transclusion of all of the sub-modules (as I've described above). The book [[Programming:C -/- -/-]] and its subpages will be deleted in two weeks (roughly around September 21, 2005). You can request the material can be available (in some form) for a period longer than the two weeks.

Forking can harm Wikibooks in that it divides the community effort into producing a Wikibook, essentially lengthening the time it creates to finish a Wikibook and creating redundant information. This policy aims to encourage community cooperation, unify contributor effort, and reduce the amount of redundant material on Wikibooks.

It is against policy to fork and any re-creations of the same module (or similar) will become a candidate for speedy deletion. I think it's unfortunate that concensus couldn't have been reached on this issue that had a technical solution. I encourage you to keep on contributing to the C++ book and I appologize that for a long time you have been sent mixed and ambiguous messages from the Wikibooks administration. I hope that we can serve you better by being more consistent with the application of our policies. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:18, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
----
Panic, I appreciate that you are working on the merge, however I must ask you to stop using the name Programming in C -/- -/- or any other name that uses those hyphens and slashes. The correct name to use is &quot;plus plus&quot;. I've move-protected the pages now so you will not be able to revert. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:58, 10 September 2005 (UTC)
==LISP==
BTW, what do you have against Lisp? Both Scheme and CLOS are quite excellent. :-) --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:20, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
----
Lisp is hard to write, the logic is hard to fallow and reading in not so easy also , the major problem is there aren't any good IDEs for the language, as for Scheme I have not used it but have looked at it, it seems to provide more ease of use but again at the time I didn't find a compiler for it, a problem I have with Scheme is that it is being used as an introductory language in many Universities in place of Pascal and C... CLOS I don't know at all... (I'll check it out)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:55, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
:A great Scheme environment is [http://www.plt-scheme.org/ PLT Scheme] (the site also has references to great books, although the real classic book is The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, also available on the web). I've seen some hard to follow Scheme programs, but then again, I've seen hard to follow programs in any language that I've had to work with. I recommend you start reading [http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html SICP]... after the first 150 pages your mind might be blown. :-)
:I think the first undergraduate course in programming ''should'' be Scheme, just as Berkeley, UofChicago, and MIT do. I TAed this introductory Java course last year, and I have to say that most of the time was wasted on little details, such as the difference between while and for, or what break is, or that super-constructors are called by default, or what public, private, and protected are. These are important concepts, but they missed the whole idea of what abstraction was. Learning Scheme, on the other hand, all you really have to work with is abstraction. The language itself is much simpler and that forces you to write better abstractions. I think for the ''second'' course students should learn all of the little details of the current &quot;fad&quot; language. So C++ or Java is appropriate then, but only after they learned abstraction, not Programming Complex Things Through a Bunch of Complex Examples and Exceptions I've Seen.

== Minor Edits ==
Panic,

I have noticed that all your edits are flagged as &quot;minor&quot;. Is that indendet? because i believe adding a new comment to a discussion is not minor. What is your view on minor / non-minor edits? --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 16:44, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
== [[Programming:C plus plus/Charter]] ==
I edited the charter page of the &quot;C plus plus&quot; book to use a table and some fancy-shmancy CSS. This way the text will automatically center in each browser, and doesn't depend on the resolution or the size of the browser window. If you don't like the change, you are free to revert it and it won't hurt my feelings at all. I also just used some simple grayscale coloring, so you can change that as well if you want some more &quot;pizzaz&quot;. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:21, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
== Page renaming ==
I see you are discussing renaming of C++ book. If you want to have a tool making such renaming automatic, please visit [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Naming convention bot]] and sign your support vote. Today we have to move all pages manually and then fix all the links. tsca.bot does it automatically. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:45, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

== Deleting pages ==
When you are attempting to delete pages, I would like to ask you to use the markup template '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|comment}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' instead of blanking the page.  Page blanking is more commonly used by vandals, and it is harder for us to keep track of where everything is at when you do that.  It also allows us to review the content of the page for a second opinion as to if it was legitimate to remove the content.

BTW, thanks for trying to help clean up Wikibooks.  That is appreciated.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:52, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

== [[C++ Programming/All Chapters]] ==

I noticed you reverted my small change and added a print friendly version, however there was one already at '''C++ Programming/Print''' so now there's a duplicate. Your version is more maintainable since it includes from the other page which is good, I was thinking though, one page would make more sense for people who have a slow connection since having to go to yet another page would require long waiting again. Is your issue with the licence and  print template? The print template could be removed and the license could be made to show up only when printed that way on screen it would look just as it does now yet includes the license when printed. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 17:27, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

I use the monolithic version to get the feel of the flow of the work, check the basic format, see duplications, stuff out of order and from time to time run a spell check see that wikipedia links are done only once (and in reading order), if you can remove the toc and the license on a single page and provide the license on printing of the page I don't have any objection...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:49, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

I noticed you readded '''Multi Paradigm''' chapter. Did you not notice that it was removed because I added its contents to '''Programming Paradigms''' once I cleaned up that chapter? So now the contents is on '''All Chapters''' twice. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 04:09, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
----
Sorry its been hard to keep up with your esthetic changes to the book, the chapters are to be split into smaller parts not aggregated, btw I feel very strongly about the use of the phrase &quot;The statically-typed free-form multi-paradigm programming language&quot; it was used in a sub chapter but as your changes have removed the by point explanation, I would like to keep it in the main since C++ is a statically-typed free-form multi-paradigm programming language and chapter one deals in explaining what C++ is...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 10:34, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
----
I have no intension of combining everything into one big page, thats what '''All Chapters''' is for. I do though see no need to split one concept across different pages if there small, as was the case with '''Programming Paradigm''' and '''Multi Paradigm'''. I think &quot;statically-typed free-form multi-paradigm programming language&quot; is a bit long for a chapter/section/part name and only one chapter explains what this is. I used &quot;What is Programming?&quot; because the chapters in this section/part deal for the most part with general programming concepts not tied to a specific programming language. My changes for the most part are esthetic right now, because I'm trying to clean up whats already there, by rearrange, clarifying and removing duplicate explanations, before adding new material.

BTW, I see you didn't like my changes to the names of the appendixes because I used C++ in their names. I did that for people printing out the wikibook, so that on paper it would be easier to tell it belongs to a book on C++. I think &quot;Internal References&quot; and &quot;External References&quot; didn't make much since either. Whats in &quot;External References&quot; isn't references at all, but resources for tools, websites and books, which is why I had changed it to &quot;C++ Resources&quot;, then there was no need to make a distinction between &quot;External&quot; and &quot;Internal&quot;. I changed &quot;Source Code Examples&quot; to &quot;C++ Examples&quot; because I don't think there needs to be emphases on the examples being source code.  I didn't change &quot;Extra Concepts&quot; because I'm not sure that these things should even be part of this wikibook, maybe different wikibooks and linked to from the Resources appendix.
--[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 15:12, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

I haven't said that it was your intention but that was &quot;our&quot; intention (editors) as specified under the conventions, to reduce page sizes, I had done a bit of the indexing of what was on each part to the &quot;main&quot; page, up-to the classes...

I do agree that &quot;statically-typed free-form multi-paradigm programming language&quot; is a bit long and I don't like a separation of the book in Parts like Basic and Advanced, I can live with the separation in parts but I strongly object to the removal of the phrase being evident on the book/toc. It was my intention of voting for the rename of the book in a future stage (there is old cover image)...

The &quot;Internal References&quot; are the reference pages already included on the book, no more no less, they were on an Appendix just to give some logic structure and be easier to see.

&quot;External References&quot; is self evident, it refers to any non wikibook reference, some are real references some are just resources but as people tend to add to that list it's just easier to aggregate all there, I don't like to see IRC channels under Web References as you have done but I can live with it.

I will reformat the changes you made on the examples to preserve the navigation, but they will still exist under the /examples/ ...

As for the use of &quot;C++&quot;, I try to hunt down every extra use of the qualifier since it's self evident that the content is about C++ and removing it can make parts of the book easier to use on other works, and it's just visually UGLY to see it repeated over and over, and saves space in wikibooks :) ...

ie: &quot;the C++ programming language&quot; -&gt; &quot;the programming language&quot;
    &quot;C++ objects&quot; -&gt; &quot;objects&quot;  
etc...

Btw I didn't like your over-simplification of the Paradigms part, you removed some logical steps that exist on the original &quot;wikipedia&quot; article that gives the reader not only the evolution of the concepts but removes the identification of layers of the OOP model that can of use to the coder/reader... In C++ we are free to do as we like, that was the NPOV that the &quot;statically-typed free-form multi-paradigm programming language&quot; phrase transmits, many people argues that we should use only one model, I for one like to mix all as to produce the simpler solution to problems...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:10, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
----
Not all pages listed under &quot;Internal References&quot; are included on some page like is claimed. I didn't add IRC channels to Weblinks, someone else did. I simply think based on how &quot;External References&quot; is currently being used, it makes more sense to refer to the contents as a collection of resources rather then as a reference. I don't have a problem with &quot;C++&quot; being removed from the contents of the pages, I think it just makes sense in the title of the Appendixes. By making the pages under &quot;Getting Started&quot; more general and more of an introduction to general programming concepts less reference to &quot;C++&quot; should be needed to make clear weither whats being discussed is specific to C++ or not.

My intention was to simplify the explanations of the different paradigms used by C++, while waiting to get into the specifics of how C++ implements the OOP layers or other programming concepts until later chapters. I don't have a problem with identifing and explaining different programming modules if they are explained in more general terms in &quot;Programming Paradigms&quot; and/or fully explaining in later chapters, such as in the &quot;Object and Object-Oriented Programming&quot; section, once the C++ OOP concepts thats relied on have been explained. This way concepts aren't explained twice and readers aren't forced to jump around in the text in order to understand whats being said, which just looks ugly to me. I hope you understand my issue was not with the different layers of the OOP model being explained, but with when and where its explained. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 22:04, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

Sorry but all pages listed under &quot;Internal References&quot; are included on some page like is claimed on the index, or they were when I've added and listed them ...&lt;br&gt;
I didn't say you have added non web links to the web resources in the &quot;External References&quot;, but I've noticed that you named them as &quot;web&quot; references in one of your edits...&lt;br&gt;
Is there a technical text that doesn´t involve the readers to jump around in the text in order to understand concepts ? tech. books aren't to be read like a novel, most are used as reference books, some parts are for and needed to beginners and others are needed to refresh even the most experienced user or one that was using a similar technology or just to keep up with need concepts. Of course that a logical structure must be enforced but for instance I really don't agree in moving the debugging concept to the end of the book any beginner needs to know how to do it and for what purpose...&lt;br&gt;
What hirks me is that as you say &quot;I'm trying to clean up whats already there, by rearrange, clarifying and removing duplicate explanations, before adding new material.&quot;, you surely understand that as the only editor that has been contributing to the book in a non-punctual way, I tend to see it as mostly &quot;my&quot; work, and it is with some pain that I see you doing major restructuring without contributing real content or debating the matter, even removing or shuffling parts that I see as important, I agree that this is a community effort but you can also try to see it from my point of view.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:16, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
----
Could you be more specific on what edit(s) involving &quot;External References&quot; your referring to? I'm not sure what you mean and its hard for me to address them without context (a history link would be helpful). I agree technical text books are used by all kinds of audiences from beginners to the more experienced as references, to learn from and to refresh on and are not novels. I was speaking of some logical structure in which concepts are built on one another in some natural flow when speaking of not having to jump around. I think first time readers may have some trouble understanding this wikibook and those readers who are trying to refresh or use this wikibook as a reference may have trouble quickly finding what it is they are looking for. This is why my focus right now is not on adding much in the way of new material. I mean no offense to you and everyone else who has contributed their time, energy and work on this wikibook. I see this as just being a common accurance of an incomplete/unfinished work.

I have added lots of redirects from '''Programming:C plus plus''' that are no longer referenced to speedy deletion in hopes of making it easier to find what remaining information is under this wikibook name, so that it may be moved to the &quot;C++ Programming&quot; wikibook if appropriate. All the redirects make it a bit hard to locate the trees from the forest, so this should make it easier. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 17:47, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
----
The merge is completed, all of the '''Programming:C plus plus''' should have been deleted some time ago at least 2 people said they would do it, it seems none did... but if you can now mark them for deletion at least someone removed the write protection ,see the discussion area for more info... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:53, 21 September 2006 (UTC)
----
Ya I saw some of the discussion area where it said it would be done which seemed dated and I could see they were still present for whatever reason. The discussion area is a bit disoragnized and is hard for me to tell what still applies or not. I decided to go ahead and at lest attempt to get deleted, what looks like could be safely deleted. Some pages are still locked however, perhaps this is the time to try to get that changed. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 20:10, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Plastic pastry bag.JPG|thumb|right|An inexpensive pastry bag, with a variety of plastic tips.]]

A '''pastry bag''' is called for whenever a recipe asks the chef to ''pipe'' semi-solid foods. This is generally a matter of [[Cookbook:Aesthetics|aesthetics]], most famously [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]] decoration.  

Once the proper tip is installed, fill the bag through the end with the wider opening, roll or twist it closed, and then squeeze it like a tube of toothpaste (from the top down, keeping the lower portion bulged out) to pipe its contents. 

Though a circular nozzle is quite useful for making round shapes, many types of tip are available.  The tip shown in the far left of the photo is a hypodermic-shaped one for filling pastries such as [[Cookbook:Cream Puff|cream puffs]], and many other types of nozzle are available for making star, leaf, and flower-petal shapes.

Aside from [[Cookbook:Icing|icing]], pastry bags are commonly used to shape [[Cookbook:Meringue|meringue]] and [[Cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]], and to fill donuts with [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] or [[Cookbook:custard|custard]].  When presentation is especially important, fluted tips can be used to shape savory foods such as filling for deviled [[Cookbook:egg|egg]], whipped [[Cookbook:butter|butter]], and mashed [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]. 

A high-quality bag is often made from waterproofed cloth, with a collection of interchangeable chrome-plated or stainless steel tips.  Each tip is cone-shaped, with a base too large to fit through the small opening in the bag; they are to be inserted through the larger opening before food is spooned in.  Less expensive models are generally of plastic film with screw-on plastic tips, while many foods (including frosting and pressurized &quot;spray can&quot; whipped cream) can be purchased in disposable packaging designed to serve the function of a pastry bag.  

A simple pastry bag can be made by rolling cooking parchment or wax paper into a cone, filling it, folding the wide end several times to close it, and then cutting the tip into whatever shape is desired.  This is especially useful for small quantities of melted [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]], since a very small hole can be cut and the bag can be discarded when it cools and becomes clogged.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called SamuraiClinton. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name SamuraiClinton~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Agent Oriented Programming==
'''Agent-oriented programming is a fairly new programming paradigm that supports a societal view of computation. In AOP, objects known as agents interact to achieve individual goals. Agents can exist in a structure as complex as a global internet or one as simple as a module of a common program. Agents can be autonomous entities, deciding their next step without the interference of a user, or they can be controllable, serving as a mediary between the user and another agent.

An agent, according to (Shoham, 1993) is &quot;an entity whose state is viewed as consisting of mental components such as beliefs, capabilities, choices, and commitments&quot;. This definition is cryptic at best and useless at worst. In his paper, Shoham narrows this definition by applying the criterion of Dennet and McCarthy. Dennet recognized that many simple, inanimate objects can be viewed as falling into this framework (which he calls the intentional stance). McCarthy suggests that mental attributes should be ascribed to objects when they are &quot;useful&quot;.

Consider, for example, the agent 'gravity'. Gravity can be viewed as an entity that is capable of applying force to objects and chooses to do so to every object it encounters. Taking the example even further, we can say that gravity can choose to apply this force in any direction and with any strength; it merely chooses to do so in a 'down' direction at 9.8m/s2 (on Earth when the second object has negligible mass compared with the first). This is not too far from the belief of many individuals before Galileo's experiments. These days, however, this view gains us nothing; it is not useful.

Consider, now, an autonomous rover on the surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa. The robot can be viewed as an agent that believes that the places with the roughest ice patches are the thinnest layers of ice. It might desire to set up drilling in those areas. It might not be capable of navigating very rocky terrain, and might therefore want to avoid such situations. These are reasonable, and possibly useful, ascriptions of mental attributes. Indeed, it might be useful to produce code with this perspective in mind. This is the reasoning behind agent-oriented programming.

Shoham suggests that an AOP system needs each of three elements to be complete :

* A formal language with clear syntax for describing the mental state. This would likely include structure for stating beliefs (e.g. the predicate calculus), passing messages, etc. Most of the research in the field has been on this portion and stresses the semantic issues related to artificial intelligence.
* A programming language in which to define agents. The semantics of this language should be closely related to those of the formal language. In many situations, functionality will be difficult or impossible to implement and further limitations will be introduced. We will see this in more than one case.
* A method for converting neutral applications into agents. This sort of tool would allow an agent to communicate with a non-agent by attributing intentions much the same way as we did with the inter-planetary rover above. This portion of the specification is not related to the language issues and will not be discussed here.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Cuisine of Italy]] | [[Cookbook:Sauces|Sauces]]

'''Marinara''' (mariner's) sauce is a southern Italian [[cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]] usually made with tomatoes, garlic, herbs (such as basil), and onion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/marinara?view=uk Definition of marinara sauce on the Oxford Dictionary website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861628423/marinara.html Definition of marinara sauce on the Encarta website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/marinara Definition of marinara sauce on the Your Dictionary website]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many variations. Some of these include the addition of [[cookbook:caper|capers]], olives and spices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/marinara-sauce-recipe2/index.html Giada Delaurentis' recipe for marinara sauce]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2007/10/mario-batali-recipe-for-marinara-sauce.html Mario Batali's recipe for marinara sauce on the Serious Eats website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional southern Italian cuisine utilizes this sauce to add flavor to pasta, rice, seafood and pizza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/5840/spaghetti%2Bmarinara Spaghetti marinara recipe on the Taste website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/penne-with-marinara-sauce-recipe/index.html Penne marinara recipe on the Foodnetwork website]&lt;/ref&gt; This sauce is also widely used in [[cookbook:Italian-American cuisine|Italian-American cuisine]] which has diverged significantly from its Old World origins.

Italians refer to marinara only in association with other recipes. For instance, ''spaghetti alla marinara'' literally translates to '''mariner's spaghetti'''. However, tomato sauce alone in Italy is called ''salsa al pomodoro'' or ''pummarola''.

==Origin==
There are at least two folk theories as to the origin of this sauce: One says cooks aboard Neapolitan ships invented marinara sauce in the mid-16th century after Spaniards introduced the [[cookbook:tomato|tomato]] (a New World vegetable) to Europe. This meat-free sauce was easy to make and resisted spoiling due to the high acid content of tomatoes. This made it ideal for lengthy sea voyages hundreds of years before refrigeration methods were invented. Another theory states this was a sauce prepared by the wives of Neapolitan sailors upon their return from sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italianchef.com/marinara.html Info on the origin of marinara sauce on the Italian Chef website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, however, we know the first Italian cookbook to include tomato sauce,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth David, ''Italian Food'' (1954, 1999), p 319, and John Dickie, ''Delizia! The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food'', 2008, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;''Lo Scalo alla Moderna'' (''The Modern Steward''), was written by Italian chef Antonio Latini and was published in two volumes in 1692 and 1694. Latini served as the Steward of the First Minister to the Spanish Viceroy of Naples. &lt;ref&gt;Alan Davidson, &quot;Europeans' Wary Encounter with Tomatoes, Potatoes, and Other New World Foods&quot; in ''Chilies to Chocolate: Food the Americas Gave the World'', (University of Arizona Press) 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth David, ''Italian Food'' (1954, 1999), p 319, and John Dickie, ''Delizia! The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food'', 2008, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodsauces.html#tomato Origins of Italian tomato sauce] Foodtimeline.org.

===Point Doubling (1I + 2M + 2S)===
Let (x,y) be a point (unequal to the ''point at infinity'') on the elliptic (prime) curve given by the equation y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. Then the point (x',y') := 2*(x,y) can be computed by

 if (y == 0)
   return POINT_AT_INFINITY
 else
   l = (3*x^2 + a) / (2y)
   x' = l^2 - 2x
   y' = l(x - x') - y
   return (x', y')

===Point Addition (1I + 2M + 1S)===
Let (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) be two points (both unequal to the ''point at infinity''). Then the point (x3,y3) := (x1,y1) + (x2,y2) can be computed by

 if (x1 == x2)
   if (y1 != y2)
     return POINT_AT_INFINITY
   else
     return POINT_DOUBLE(x1, y1)
 l = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
 x3 = l^2 - x1 - x2
 y3 = l(x1 - x3) - y1 = l(x2 - x3) - y2
 return (x3, y3)

===Point decompression===
The following algorithm calculates for a given x a value y, such that (x,y) is a point on the elliptic curve.
 t = x^3 + ax + b
 if (t|p) &gt;= 0
   return y = sqrt(t)  (the result y = -sqrt(t) would be correct, too)
 else 
   return POINT_NOT_EXPANDABLE

Notes: 
# (t|p) denotes the [[Wikipedia:Quadratic_residue_symbol|Legendre symbol]] of t, which decides whether t is a square number or not.
# The square root can be calculated using the Algorithm of Shanks &amp; Tonelli.

===Introduction===
'''Standard Projective Coordinates''' are used to represent elliptic curve points on prime curves y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. Their usage might give a speed benefit over ''Affine Coordinates'' when the cost for field inversions is significantly higher than field multiplications. In ''Standard Projective Coordinates'' the triple (X, Y, Z) represents the affine point (X / Z, Y / Z).

===Point Doubling (7M + 5S or 7M + 3S) ===
Let (X, Y, Z) be a point (unequal to the ''point at infinity'') represented in ''Standard Projective Coordinates''. Then its double (X', Y', Z') can be calculated by
 
 if (Y == 0) 
  return POINT_AT_INFINITY
 W = a*Z^2 + 3*X^2
 S = Y*Z
 B = X*Y*S
 H = W^2 - 8*B
 X' = 2*H*S
 Y' = W*(4*B - H) - 8*Y^2*S^2
 Z' = 8*S^3
 return (X', Y', Z')

Note: if a = -3, then W can also be calculated as W = 3*(X + Z)*(X - Z), saving 2 field squarings.

===Point Addition (12M + 2S) ===
Let (X1, Y1, Z1) and (X2, Y2, Z2) be two points (both unequal to the ''point at infinity'') represented in ''Standard Projective Coordinates''. Then the sum (X3, Y3, Z3) can be calculated by
 U1 = Y2*Z1
 U2 = Y1*Z2
 V1 = X2*Z1
 V2 = X1*Z2
 if (V1 == V2)
   if (U1 != U2)
     return POINT_AT_INFINITY
   else
     return POINT_DOUBLE(X1, Y1, Z1)
 U = U1 - U2
 V = V1 - V2
 W = Z1*Z2
 A = U^2*W - V^3 - 2*V^2*V2
 X3 = V*A
 Y3 = U*(V^2*V2 - A) - V^3*U2
 Z3 = V^3*W
 return (X3, Y3, Z3)

=== Mixed Addition (with affine point) (9M + 2S) ===
Let (X1, Y1, Z1) be a point represented in ''Standard Projective Coordinates'' and (X2, Y2) a point in ''Affine Coordinates'' (both unequal to the ''point at infinity''). A formula to add those points can be readily derived from the regular standard projective point addition by replacing each occurrence of &quot;Z2&quot; by &quot;1&quot; (and thereby dropping three field multiplications).

They give a speed benefit over ''Affine Coordinates'' when the cost for field inversions is significantly higher than field multiplications. In ''Jacobian Coordinates'' the triple (X, Y, Z) represents the affine point (X / Z^2, Y / Z^3).

===Point Doubling (4M + 6S or 4M + 4S) ===
Let (X, Y, Z) be a point (unequal to the ''point at infinity'') represented in ''Jacobian Coordinates''. Then its double (X', Y', Z') can be calculated by
 if (Y == 0)
   return POINT_AT_INFINITY
 S = 4*X*Y^2
 M = 3*X^2 + a*Z^4
 X' = M^2 - 2*S
 Y' = M*(S - X') - 8*Y^4
 Z' = 2*Y*Z
 return (X', Y', Z')

Note: if a = -3, then M can also be calculated as M = 3*(X + Z^2)*(X - Z^2), saving 2 field squarings.

=== Repeated Doubling ((4m-1)M + (4m+2)S) ===
Let P=(X, Y, Z) be a point (unequal to the ''point at infinity'') represented in ''Jacobian Coordinates''. Then, '''in the case a = -3''', its &quot;m-fold double&quot; (2^m)P can be calculated as follows:
 Y = 2*Y
 W = Z^4
 while(m--)
   if (Y == 0)
     return POINT_AT_INFINITY
   A = 3*(X^2 - W)
   B = X*Y^2
   X = A^2 - 2B
   Z = Z*Y
   if (m)
     W = W*Y^4
   Y = 2*A*(B - X) - Y^4
 Y = Y/2
 return (X, Y, Z)

An alternative repeated doubling routine with costs (4m)M + (4m+2)S for any value a can be derived from the [[Modified Jacobian Coordinates|Modified Jacobian]] doubling routine. For small values a (say 0 or -3) the costs reduce to (4m-1)M + (4m+2)S, competing nicely with the algorithm showed above.

===Point Addition (12M + 4S) ===
Let (X1, Y1, Z1) and (X2, Y2, Z2) be two points (both unequal to the ''point at infinity'') represented in ''Jacobian Coordinates''. Then the sum (X3, Y3, Z3) can be calculated by
 U1 = X1*Z2^2
 U2 = X2*Z1^2
 S1 = Y1*Z2^3
 S2 = Y2*Z1^3
 if (U1 == U2)
   if (S1 != S2)
     return POINT_AT_INFINITY
   else 
     return POINT_DOUBLE(X1, Y1, Z1)
 H = U2 - U1
 R = S2 - S1
 X3 = R^2 - H^3 - 2*U1*H^2
 Y3 = R*(U1*H^2 - X3) - S1*H^3
 Z3 = H*Z1*Z2
 return (X3, Y3, Z3)

=== Mixed Addition (with affine point) (8M + 3S) ===
Let (X1, Y1, Z1) be a point represented in ''Jacobian Coordinates'' and (X2, Y2) a point in ''Affine Coordinates'' (both unequal to the ''point at infinity''). A formula to add those points can be readily derived from the regular jacobian point addition by replacing each occurrence of &quot;Z2&quot; by &quot;1&quot; (and thereby dropping four field multiplications and one field squaring).

=== Mixed Addition (with chudnovsky point) (11M + 3S) ===
Let (X1, Y1, Z1) be a point represented in ''Jacobian Coordinates'' and (X2, Y2, Z2, Z2^2, Z2^3) a point in ''Chudnovsky Coordinates'' (both unequal to the ''point at infinity''). Then the sum (X3, Y3, Z3) can be readily calculated using the addition formula given above (saving one field multiplication and one field squaring).

===Introduction===
'''Chudnovsky Coordinates''' are used to represent elliptic curve points on prime curves y^2 = x^3 + ax + b. They give a speed benefit over ''Affine Coordinates'' when the cost for field inversions is significantly higher than field multiplications. In ''Chudnovsky Coordinates'' the quintuple (X, Y, Z, Z^2, Z^3) represents the affine point (X / Z^2, Y / Z^3).

===Point Doubling (5M + 6S or 5M + 4S) ===
Let (X, Y, Z, Z^2, Z^3) be a point (unequal to the ''point at infinity'') represented in ''Chudnovsky Coordinates''. Then its double (X', Y', Z', Z'^2, Z'^3) can be calculated by
 if (Y == 0)
   return POINT_AT_INFINITY
 S = 4*X*Y^2
 M = 3*X^2 + a*(Z^2)^2
 X' = M^2 - 2*S
 Y' = M*(S - X') - 8*Y^4
 Z' = 2*Y*Z
 Z'^2 = Z'^2
 Z'^3 = Z'^2 * Z'
 return (X', Y', Z', Z'^2, Z'^3)

Note: if a = -3, then M can also be calculated as M = 3*(X + Z^2)*(X - Z^2), saving 2 field squarings.

===Point Addition (11M + 3S) ===
Let (X1, Y1, Z1, Z1^2, Z1^3) and (X2, Y2, Z2, Z2^2, Z2^3) be two points (both unequal to the ''point at infinity'') represented in ''Chudnovsky Coordinates''. Then the sum (X3, Y3, Z3, Z3^2, Z3^3) can be calculated by
 U1 = X1*Z2^2
 U2 = X2*Z1^2
 S1 = Y1*Z2^3
 S2 = Y2*Z1^3
 if (U1 == U2)
   if (S1 != S2)
     return POINT_AT_INFINITY
   else 
     return POINT_DOUBLE(X1, Y1, Z1, Z1^2, Z1^3)
 H = U2 - U1
 R = S2 - S1
 X3 = R^2 - H^3 - 2*U1*H^2
 Y3 = R*(U1*H^2 - X3) - S1*H^3
 Z3 = H*Z1*Z2
 Z3^2 = Z3^2
 Z3^3 = Z3^2 * Z3
 return (X3, Y3, Z3)

=== Mixed Addition (with affine point) (8M + 3S) ===
Let (X1, Y1, Z1, Z1^2, Z1^3) be a point represented in ''Chudnovsky Coordinates'' and (X2, Y2) a point in ''Affine Coordinates'' (both unequal to the ''point at infinity''). A formula to add those points can be readily derived from the regular chudnovsky point addition by replacing each occurrence of &quot;Z2&quot; by &quot;1&quot; (and thereby dropping three field multiplications).

=== Mixed Addition (with jacobian point) (11M + 3S) ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">I find the title fairly misguiding, as the text deals very little with war and peace. This is easily demonstrable by the fact that a search for &quot;war&quot; in the text only found it used 9 times, 5 of which is in reference to time periods - all of them in connection with the World Wars (eg. &quot;in the post-World War II era&quot;), 3 of them as parts of words with no direct connection to war (&quot;toward&quot;, &quot;warrant&quot;, &quot;global warming&quot;) and 1 time in reference to the war on Iraq. The same search for &quot;peace&quot; turns up no(!) hits. I suggest a renaming is in order. --[[User:Kissekatt|Kissekatt]] 10:15, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Pronominal verbs ==

Pronominal verbs are verbs that include pronouns. These pronouns are ''me'', ''te'', ''se'', ''nous'', and ''vous'' and are used as either direct objects or indirect objects, depending on the verb that they modify. When pronominal verbs are conjugated in perfect tenses, être is used as the auxiliary verb.

The following table shows which reflexive pronoun to use with each form of the verb:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Subject 
! Reflexive pronoun
|- 
| je || me
|-
| tu || te
|-
| il, elle, on || se
|-
| nous || nous
|-
| vous || vous
|-
| ils, elles || se
|}

=== Reflexive verbs ===
Reflexive verbs reflect the action on the subject.

*Je ''me'' lave. - I wash ''myself''.
*Nous ''nous'' lavons. - We wash ''ourselves''.
*Ils ''se'' lavent. - They wash ''themselves''.

Reflexive verbs can also be used as infinitives.

*Je vais me laver. - I'm going to wash myself.

Either the conjugated verb or the infinitive can be negated each with slightly different meanings.

*Je ne vais pas me laver. - I'm not going to wash myself.
*Je vais ne pas me laver. - I'm going to not wash myself (for some period of time, e.g.).

In perfect tenses, the past participles agree with the direct object pronoun, but not the indirect object pronoun, in gender and plurality. Therefore it would only agree when the reflexive pronoun is the direct object. Also remember that the past participle does not agree with the direct object if it goes after the verb.

*Elle s'est lavée. - She washed herself.
*Nous nous sommes lavé(e)s. - We washed ourselves.
*Elle s'est lavé les mains. - She washed her hands.
*Nous nous sommes lavé les mains. - We washed our hands.

Here is an example conjugation of a reflexive verb:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;
! colspan=3 | '''Se coucher - to go to bed'''
|-
! '''Present'''{{ref|present}}
! '''Passé composé'''{{ref|passé}}
! '''Futur proche'''{{ref|futur}}
|-
| Je '''me''' couche || Je '''me''' suis couché(e) || Je vais '''me''' coucher
|-
| Tu '''te''' couches || Tu '''t''''es couché(e) || Tu vas '''te''' coucher
|-
| Il '''se''' couche || Il '''s''''est couché || Il va '''se''' coucher
|-
| Elle '''se''' couche || Elle '''s''''est couchée || Elle va '''se''' coucher
|-
| On '''se''' couche || On '''s''''est couché || On va '''se''' coucher
|-
| Nous '''nous''' couchons || Nous '''nous''' sommes couché(e)s || Nous allons '''nous''' coucher
|-
| Vous '''vous''' couchez || Vous '''vous''' êtes couché(e)(s) || Vous allez '''vous''' coucher
|-
| Ils '''se''' couchent || Ils '''se''' sont couchés || Ils vont '''se''' coucher
|-
| Elles '''se''' couchent || Elles '''se''' sont couchées || Elles vont '''se''' coucher
|}

{{note|present}}'''1.''' The futur simple, passé simple, imperfect, conditional and subjunctive are all conjugated with the reflexive pronoun in the same position as in the present.

{{note|passé}}'''2.''' All reflexive verbs take être in the passé composé and therefore have an ''e'' added to the past participle for females and an ''s'' for plural.

{{note|futur}}'''3.''' When a reflexive verb is put as an infinitive behind any other verb (e.g. vouloir, pouvoir, aller...) it still takes the appropriate reflexive pronoun.

=== Reciprocal verbs ===
With reciprocal verbs, people perform actions to each other.

: Nous nous aimons. - We like each other.

Like reflexive verbs, the past participle of reciprocal verbs agrees in number and gender with the direct object if it goes before the verb. It therefore agrees with all reciprocal pronouns that function as direct objects.

: Nous nous sommes aimé(e)s. - We liked each other.

The reciprocal pronoun can also function as an indirect object without a direct object pronoun.
: Nous nous sommes parlé. - We spoke to each other.
: Elles se sont téléphoné. - They telephoned one another.
: Vous vous êtes écrit souvent? - You wrote to each other often?

=== Naturally pronominal verbs ===
Some verbs are pronominal without performing a reflexive or reciprocal action.

: Tu te souviens? -  Do you remember?

In perfect tenses, these verbs agree with the direct object if it goes before the verb. Otherwise, the past participle agrees with the subject.

: Elle s'est souvenue. - She remembered.

Some verbs have different meanings as pronominal verbs.

*rendre - to return, to give back
*se rendre (à) - to go (to)

== Negation ==

=== ''ne..pas'' ===
*Simple negation is done by wrapping ''ne...pas'' around the verb.
**Je ne vole pas. - I do not steal.
*In a perfect tense, ''ne...pas'' wraps around the auxiliary verb, not the participle.
**Je n'ai pas volé. - I haven't stolen.
*When an infinitive and conjugated verb are together, ''ne...pas'' usually wraps around the conjugated verb.
**Je ne veux pas voler. - I do not want to steal.
*''ne pas'' can also go directly in front of the infinitive for a different meaning.
**Je veux ne pas voler. - I want not to steal.
*''ne'' goes before any pronoun relating to the verb it affects.
**Je ne l'ai pas volé. - I did not steal it.
**Nous ne nous aimons pas. - We do not love each other.

=== Other negative expressions ===
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
| ne...aucun(e)||not any, none, no
|-
| ne...jamais||never
|-
| ne...ni...ni||neither...nor
|-
| ne...pas du tout||not at all
|-
| ne...pas encore||not yet
|-
| ne...personne||nobody
|-
| ne...plus|| no longer
|-
| ne...guère||hardly
|-
| ne...que||only
|-
| ne...rien||nothing
|-
|}

* ''ne...personne'' wraps around the entire verb set.
** Je ne l'ai donné à personne. - I did not give it to anyone.
** Je ne veux le donner à personne. - I do not want to give it to anybody.
* ''ne...ni...ni'' requires two objects, either direct or indirect, and comes before them.
** Je ne l'ai donné ni à mon frère, ni à ma sœur. - I gave it neither to my brother nor my sister.
** Je ne peux voir ni mon frère ni ma sœur. - I am able to see neither my brother nor my sister.
* In ''ne...aucun(e)'', ''aucun(e) goes before an object.
** Il n'a aucun ami. Aucun. - He has no friend. None.
** Il n'a aucune feuille de papier. Aucune. - He has no sheet of paper. None.
* Il n'a qu'une feuille de papier. - He has only one piece of paper.
* Je ne peux guère voir mon frère et ma sœur - I can hardly see my brother and sister.

=== Spoken French ===
Now, the 'ne' sometimes disappears when one speaks. However, it is always used in written French and for formal conversations. 

* Je ne l'ai donné à personne -&gt; Je l'ai donné à personne (I didn't give it to anyone)
* Je ne sais pas -&gt; Je sais pas (I don't know)

=== Summary ===

To say &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt;, or other negative verbs, you have to 'sandwich' the negative words around a verb.

Example:

*Il '''n''''y a '''pas''' de cinéma. (meaning: &quot;There is '''no''' cinema&quot;)
*On '''ne''' peut '''jamais''' aller en boîte. (meaning: &quot;You can '''never''' go partying&quot;)
*Il '''n'''' y a '''rien''' à faire ici. (meaning: &quot;There is '''nothing''' to do here&quot;)

If &quot; '''ne''' &quot; is before a vowel then it changes to &quot; '''n'''' &quot;.

This template displays the various programming language skill levels associated with a particular programming language, the syntax for adding a userbox to one's user page to indicate one's skill level, and also provides links to jump to a particular skill level in the resulting listing of users proficient in that programming language.

==Usage==
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Usersprogram|language}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; where &quot;language&quot; corresponds to the language code listed at [[Wikibooks:Userboxes/Programming]].

==Example==
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Usersprogram|perl}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

produces the following:

{{Usersprogram|perl|category=}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">--[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 18:38, 25 September 2005 (UTC) This page seems to be coming along well.

This page looks almost there.  I think it's a little heavy on resume/cover letter and a little light on the actualy foundation of business - memos, emails, proposals, reports.  A little &quot;beefing up&quot; there would be good.  Also, it might pay off to do a little editing.  Whoever put this together did a very solid job, but sometimes their claims are a little vague, or their phrasing could be tightened up a little bit. --[[User:tigerrat29|tigerrat29]] 21:35, 11 October 2006 (UTC)


Anyone know what happened to proposals and business plans?

== useless pictues ==

Why are there pictures in this page?  It's possible pictures might make it visually more pleasant but they currently don't, and have little to do with the content. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 19:06, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

I agree. I don't get it. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 21:35, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

I think an example email and more on business proposals would be helpful. --[[User:Brttnyrhea|Brttnyrhea]] 19:10, 4 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">--[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 18:40, 25 September 2005 (UTC) This page would benefit from the addition of section headings like the other pages.

-- 01 Dec Dennis G. Jerz.  What about reorganizing this section to specify the difference between substantive editing and proofreading? Both are editing tasks, but I make a big deal about how substantive editing is vital in the early stages, and proofreading is a waste of time until your paper is in good shape.  I prefer to use the word &quot;revision&quot; when I mean &quot;making big changes in the structure&quot; and &quot;editing&quot; only when I mean proofreading.

I think that's an excellent idea, Dennis. I do the same thing when I teach editing. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 16:47, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

--[[User:Peabody33|Peabody33]] 23:47, 22 February 2007 (UTC)== Nice to see Wiki again... ==

Hello, Wiki.

== Editing vs. Revision ==

I was reading the comment about being sure to define the difference between editing and revising.  I see that there is a section about that difference in the revision section of the book.  I am wondering if students might automatically check out only the editing section rather than the revision section.  My suggestion would be to include the same definition of the difference between editing and revision in BOTH sections...  --[[User:Kyoung|Kyoung]] 00:38, 3 November 2007 (UTC)

I agree, Kim. I also wonder if we shouldn't rearrange the order of topics on the Rhet/Comp homepage. I think &quot;Revision&quot; should follow &quot;Drafting,&quot; and &quot;Editing should follow &quot;Revision.&quot;--[[User:Joshboyd|Joshboyd]] 23:54, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

I was wondering if &quot;Editing Tips&quot; should follow &quot;Macro and Micro Level Editing&quot;  I was also wondering if we could maybe change Macro and Micro-Level Editing&quot; to something like &quot;Proofreading and Editing&quot; or &quot;The Difference Between Proofreading and Editing&quot; or &quot;Editing vs. Proofreading&quot;  Just an idea. --[[User:Faithmarie22|Faithmarie22]] 04:57, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

I also think maybe we should delete that entire paragraph on the &quot;Professor and the Madman.&quot; I don't think it relates because it is really neither about introductions nor editing, but I'm afraid to hit the trigger. Anyone with me?--[[User:Faithmarie22|Faithmarie22]] 18:44, 28 November 2007 (UTC)  Update:  I did delete it, I suppose if anyone is opposed they can bring it back. --[[Special:Contributions/199.17.19.212|199.17.19.212]] 20:27, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

== Macro/micro ==

I agree with you, Faith.  The micro/macro editing section needs some work.  I agree with both of your suggestions.  I'm wondering if some of that first paragraph called micro/macro editing needs to be removed all together.  What do you all think?  It seems like a lot of mumble jumble (kind of like this posting of mine  :-) ).--[[User:Kyoung|Kyoung]] 05:21, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

Also, overall do some sections seem to be more about composing than actually editing. Perhaps we need to rework some of these sections so they focus more on editing.--[[User:Faithmarie22|Faithmarie22]] 00:36, 3 December 2007 (UTC)

--[[User:Joshboyd|Joshboyd]] 23:46, 5 December 2007 (UTC) I think we should move the first sections (i.e. Introductions, thesis statements, etc.) into a section on either composing or revising. When I think of editing, I think of small changes, not rewriting my introduction or even evaluating my introduction to see if it makes sense. Anyone opposed? If not, let's clean out this section.

I am not opposed, I do not think they belong in the editing section -- but I don't think we can ignore overall editing either - the overall structure, meaning, clarity, organization, etc.. Not JUST minor changes. I'm not sure if that's what you meant.--[[User:Faithmarie22|Faithmarie22]] ([[User talk:Faithmarie22|talk]]) 20:23, 13 December 2007 (UTC)

== Matt's Thoughts ==

I'm a bit short on time here, but I've made some changes to this chapter's overview to hopefully better explain the distinction between editing, revising, and reviewing. They are obviously closely related, but it seems worthwhile to consider them independently, since they have different problems associated with them. Briefly:

Editing - going over a document and deciding what should be changed. Usually this is limited in composition textbooks to mean writing style (sentence structure, word choice, tone, etc.), though in the industry it could mean any kind of changes (an editor at a newspaper could ask for a re-write or reject a piece outright). It seems most useful here to go with the traditional understanding, just focusing on how to improve sentences, check for offensive tone, adding helpful examples, reading aloud to eliminate harsh-sounding prose, etc.  

Revising - actually making the changes. I separate this because it is easy to introduce new errors when you are trying to fix old ones. The basic advice is this: If you change one word, re-read the whole sentence and edit accordingly. If you change a sentence, re-read the whole paragraph and edit accordingly; you get the idea. I also like to focus on revising the intro, since most writers introduce new ideas as they draft and forget to go back and include them in the introduction.

Reviewing - editing another writer's work. Most of what is in the editing section will apply here, but it's worth focusing on how to be diplomatic here and not offend someone. It's basically a chapter on how to offer constructive criticism.

Hope this helps!!! --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] ([[User talk:Mattbarton.exe|talk]]) 23:16, 13 January 2011 (UTC)

== Matt H's thoughts ==

“The actual process of changing the introduction is called revising and comes with own set of difficulties.” – should be “with *its* own set of difficulties.” (So is this a potential edit, or revision?)


I would also rewrite the following:

“A book written by Richard Lanham titled Analyzing Prose is a great tool for writers looking to pick up ideas for new styles.”

… as:

“Richard Lanham’s ''Analyzing Prose'' is a great tool for helping writers generate ideas for new styles.”

== Emily's Thought(s) ==

Could the &quot;Editing Checklist&quot; contain links to examples?  

In general, does it make sense to have all the external links at the bottom? Or should they be included throughout the section?
--[[User:Emily.isackson|Emily.isackson]] ([[User talk:Emily.isackson|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Emily.isackson|contribs]]) 20:52, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

== Karl's Thoughts ==

I agree with Emily that the &quot;Editing Checklist&quot; might benefit from links to examples.
In my own case, I prefer external links included throughout each section, links that expand upon a subject if so desired.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Nateji77. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Nateji77~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This book was started for use by anyone wishing to gain background knowledge of criminal law or indeed anyone who is studying criminal law. It is aimed at an A-Level audience, who have prior knowledge of the legal system, to provide a light read along with some of the more precise &amp; heavy books available.

This book uses several conventions which are assumed to be known to the intended audience of this book.

===What constitutes a Crime===
The layman's answer would be something along the lines of actions that are in opposition to the laws (statutes) that govern the country. Law students who begin their studies in Criminal Law will grow to realise that a &quot;crime&quot; constitutes many facets which go beyond the &quot;bad act&quot; itself (the actus reus). In looking at whether a person is a &quot;criminal&quot;, one has to look at the mental state the person had while committing the crime(his &quot;mens rea&quot;). It would be worthwhile to remember that every person charged with a crime is presumed innocent until proven guilty.

==Basic Principles of Criminal Law==

===Procedural Issues===

Criminal law is based on the theory that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty. In the England and Wales it is the job of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to prove the guilt of the accused in most cases.  It is the job of the defendant's solicitor or barrister to prepare and submit a defence. This is done in court by testing the strength of the evidence against the defendant using methods such as discrediting witnesses or challenging the legality of evidence e.g. a stop and search carried out by a police constable was not lawful according to the rules under section 2 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The court must be satisfied that the defendant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt before a conviction can be achieved. All of these elements are derived from the Rule of Law which exists to protect personal liberty, an idea originally conceived by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicey Dicey].

It is obvious to see that in theory, if not entirely in practice, it is hard for the accused to be convicted of a crime; more importantly a crime that the accused did not himself commit. This may seem weighted too far on the side of the accused.  However, it is answered by a basic principle of English criminal law: &quot;it is better to release five criminals than it is to convict one innocent&quot;.

===Actus Reus &amp; Mens Rea===

====Introduction====

In order to establish whether a criminal offence has been committed, we must first establish what the components (often known as &quot;elements&quot;) of that offence are. As an example, Theft is defined in s. 1 Theft Act 1968: A man shall be guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another, with the intention to permanently deprive the other of it, and thief and steal shall be construed accordingly.&quot; We can distinguish five elements to this offence: (1) dishonesty, (2) appropriation, (3) property, (4) belonging to another, and (5) intention to permanently deprive. All five of these elements must be present at the same time (see below) for the offence to be committed.

Every element of an offence falls into one of two categories: actus reus (latin for &quot;guilty act&quot;) and mens rea (Latin for &quot;guilty mind&quot;). Most criminal offences contain both actus reus and mens rea elements. These are known as crimes with fault liability. Other offences, known as strict liability, require no guilty mind, or mens rea element. In these cases, the crime is committed simply by commission of the act. An example of a strict liability offence would be driving without valid insurance.

A crime can only be committed where both actus reus and mens rea occur at the same time. In some circumstances, this rule has been widely interpreted to include offences which the law is clearly intended to protect against. Thus in Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, when the defendant parked his car on the foot of a traffic policeman by accident, he could not be found guilty of a crime, since he did not have the requisite mens rea at the same time as the actus reus. However, the court interpreted his failure to move the car as a 'continuing' act, which coincided with his knowledge and therefore intention to harm the policeman. Fagan was thus guilty of a crime.

====Actus Reus====

Actus reus refers to the physical parts of the crime (the guilty act) We can categorize the actus reus elements of a crime into three types: conduct, consequences, and circumstances.

As an example, consider the definition of theft stated in the introduction. The actus reus elements of theft are &quot;appropriation&quot; &quot;property&quot; and &quot;belonging to another&quot; . As you can see, there is no requirement of a consequence - so it doesn't matter whether, for example, the accused actually managed to get away with the property - theft is committed if there is an appropriation of property belonging to another together with the required mens rea elements.

An example of a crime which does require a consequence is murder - murder is not committed unless the accused's conduct results in a death.

====Causation====

For any defendant to be convicted of any crime, causation must be proved. In practice, this is rarely demonstrated since most causation is obvious and uncontested. If A punches B in the face, there is no necessity for a legal argument to prove that the actual bodily harm suffered by B was caused by A. However, in some cases, it may be questioned whether the acts of the accused did cause the result.

When considering causation, there are five tests to determine whether causation can be established. Two of these are the tests of factual causation (Did the conduct actually cause the result) and the other three are tests of legal causation (Is the defendant to be held legally responsible for the consequences).

=====Factual Causation=====

* The 'But-For' Test
The first test of factual causation poses the question &quot;But for the actions of the defendant, would the result have occurred?&quot;. Paraphrasing, the court is generally trying to discover whether the consequence would have resulted regardless of the accused's actions. If the answer to this question is no, and the result could only have occurred due to the actions of the defendant, factual causation is one step towards established. If the answer is yes, and the result would have occurred anyway, then factual causation is not established.

A case demonstrating this is R v. White, 1910. The defendant in this case, laced his mother's drink of milk with poison, however she did not drink it,but died later anyway. It was later revealed that she died due to a heart attack. Since his mother would have died regardless of the fact that he poisoned her drink, White was acquitted of murder. Factual causation had not been established.

* The 'De-Minimus' Principle
The second test for factual causation is the requirement that the defendant's actions must be more than a minimal cause of the result. An example could be that A pushes B into a main road. C is driving towards B at great speed and B jumps to the kerb and slips, spraining his ankle. A cannot fairly be held liable for the spraining of B's ankle. Though his actions were a direct cause of the result, they were no more than a minimal result. 

A case where the De-Minimus case was used to establish factual causation is R v. Pagett, 1983. Here, Pagett was escaping some armed police whilst also firing back at them. By trying to escape and hide from then he ran up to his flat where his heavily pregnant girlfriend was and used her as a shield against the police. He was found to have factually caused the girls death, as his actions of firing on the police were more than a minimal cause of her death. 

NB- R v. Pagett, 1983, is also a case used to demonstrate the 'But For' Test

=====Legal Causation=====

The three tests for establishing legal causation are the 'Thin Skull' test, Operative and Significant Cause, and Novus Actus Interveniens.

* The 'Thin-Skull' test

Less a test, and closer to a principle, the 'thin skull' test merely applies the doctrine that a defendant must &quot;take his victim as he finds&quot;. The test is called the 'thin skull' test because of the standard example quoted, though it is not known whether the phrase is coined from an actual case.

Where a victim, A, suffers from a condition which renders him more susceptible to injury than a non-suffering counterpart, B, he should not suffer unequal protection from the law. 

Where a victim has a 'thin skull' or other condition or circumstance, it may be the case that he suffers an injury that a person not affected by such a condition would not suffer. Were a defendant to strike someone around the head, for example, a victim with a thin skull may suffer brain damage while the average person might suffer no injury at all. The thin-skull test seeks to attach liability to those defendants who, in terms of public policy, should not escape liability based on the individual's characteristics.

In Regina vs. Blaue, 1975, the defendant, who had entered the victim's house and stabbed her four times, was found guilty of murder when the victim, a Jehovah's witness, refused a blood transfusion which would have saved her life. Though evidence showed that the wounds would not have otherwise proved fatal, Blaue was convicted on the grounds that he had legally caused the victim's death.

*Operative and Significant Cause

*Novus Actus Interveniens

=====Is causation a purely matter of law?=====

As outlined above causation in criminal law is understood as a chain of events linked to each other - it is a link between the defendant’s act and the consequence which occurred as a result of that act. As causation represents an integral element of result crimes - the one to be proved, the law developed certain tests to establish it. They represent a two-stage process or two tests to be applied in succession. The first test is factual causation and the second one is legal causation. 

Thus, it is seen from the outset that causation is effectively a mixture being a question of fact and a question of law at the same time or, in other words, causation is a factual issue to begin the analysis and a legal one to finalise the findings. At the same time, it is arguable that legal causation itself is a facade of a chosen approach to allocating blame. Indeed, it is submitted that criminal law itself is a mechanism for allocating blame. In turn, allocation of blame is a process which is almost inevitably based on moral and policy considerations. 

[http://www.russian-services.com/articles/ Causation in English law: A matter of law, of fact or morals (a way of allocating blame)?]

=====Liability for Omissions=====

Generally, the law of England imposes no criminal liability for omissions - there is no general duty to act. If, for example, a person walking along the beach one day sees a drowning child in the water, he is under no legal duty to intervene, even if it would be easy for him to do so.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule, however. The first of these are that there is a recognisable duty to act imposed by law where there exists a special relationship between the parties, such as a parent's duty to care for his/her child. A duty can arise through contractual relationships (R v. Pittwood, 1902), or can also arise through one's own conduct. For example, in R v. Miller, 1982, the defendant was held liable for the criminal damage to a building caused by fire. Miller, a vagrant, fell asleep in a disused property and dropped a lit cigarette onto a mattress. When he awoke to find the mattress smouldering, he simply moved to another room. Legally, he was bound to act since the dangerous circumstance was of his own creation, and his omission was therefore criminal. Criminal liability for omissions, has in the past, been held to include doctors who have not acted after taking the Hippocratic Oath.

====Mens Rea====

The mens rea of a crime is made up of those elements which relate to the state of mind of the accused. In our example of theft, the mens rea elements are &quot;dishonesty&quot; and &quot;intention to permanently deprive&quot;. Mens rea elements are often harder to spot in legislation as the words are adjectives, generally non-standard and emotive. Examples might include &quot;dishonest&quot;, &quot;intentionally&quot;, &quot;fraudulently&quot;, or &quot;knowingly&quot;. The three types of accepted mens rea elements are intention, recklessness or negligence.

=====Intention=====
Criminal intention can be further broken into two groups, direct and oblique. A direct intention is the willful desire to commit an act. It must be understood that the intention sufficient to amount to mens rea is only the intention to perform the required criminal act, not an intention for the result to occur. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (Section 47 of the Offences Against The Person Act 1861) is a good example here. The requisite mens rea is intention to cause assault. If A intentionally assaults B and harm results, he is guilty of the offence. The fact that he does not intend harm is irrelevant. He intended to do the act, and harm is simply a by-product.

Oblique intention, also known as indirect intention, refers to a knowledge or belief that a consequence is a virtual certainty, and acting with this in mind, although the result may not be intended. To explain further: A intends to punch B, but they are separated by a pane of glass. His intention to punch B is direct as he desires to perform this act. Breaking the glass in pursuance of his goal amounts to the actus reus of criminal damage, but A does not desire for this to take place. Since punching B will inevitably result in breaking the glass, it is a virtual certainty. therefore, in punching B, A had oblique intention for criminal damage - He appreciates that it will happen, and although does not desire it, continues to act regardless.

=====Recklessness=====
Intention will be more clear from an example: suppose that a man has many desires, some of which are deemed to be too visionary, some he lacks the energy to implement. But if he decides to achieve his desires, and begins to start to act ''to that end'', the desire becomes the intention with which he acts.

=====Negligence=====

=====Transferred Malice=====

The doctrine of 'transferred malice' operates when there is an unexpected divergence between the defendant's mental state and the occurrence of the actus reus. The mens rea is regarded as transferred when this divergence is immaterial to the definition of the offence. Thus, if D fires a gun intending to kill T but misses and kills V instead, the fact that V's death was unintended does not preclude D's liability for murder. It is sufficient that D intended to kill a person — the identity of that person is irrelevant to the offence definition. Compare this with the situation where D's bullet, instead of hitting T, breaks a window of the nearby house. Here the intention to kill a person cannot be 'transferred' to make D guilty of criminal damage — an offence with a different mens rea requirement.

==Strict Liability==

Sometimes the legislature departs from the maxim ''actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea'' by creating offences of strict liability. The liability is said to be ‘strict’ when there is no mens rea requirement in relation to one or more elements of the actus reus. For example, under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 the offences involving children under 13 do not require any mens rea on the part of the defendant as to the age of the child (R v. G [2006] 2 Cr App R 17). Here the prosecution needs only to prove that the defendant intentionally committed the relevant acts and that the victim was under 13; his genuine or otherwise reasonable belief that the child was older is irrelevant. 

In English law most strict liability offences are statutory, with few common law exceptions such as contempt of the court and criminal libel.

==Complicity==

==The Criminal Liability of Corporations==
Corporate criminal liability occurs either through direct liability or vicarious liability.Direct liability needs a directing mind and will. Direct liability tends to focus on more serious offences requiring the establishment of mens rea, including secondary offences of aiding and abetting, counselling and procuring. Vicarious liability occurs on the basis of 'respondeat superior' or 'let the master answer'.

The recent statute enacted on July 26, 2007 , Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act v2007, is the criminalisation of corporate liability, especially with regard to health and safety offences.An organisation will be guilty of an offence if the way in which its activities are managed or organised causes a person's death, and amounts to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed by the organisation to the deceased. 


The new Act brings in tough penalties for companies causing deaths of workers by negligent management in industry, or fatalities and injuries to passengers in public transport. Deaths in prison and police cells is part of the new corporate manslaughter measures and organisations such as the Police Authority are classed as corporations.

Before the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007, there have been cases in the UK courts in which the issue of criminal liability of companies were decided upon. One such case is as follows:


----
Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass (1972) HL
----
The appellant company was charged with an offence under the trade descriptions legislation of displaying inaccurate price information in one of its stores.  The company was convicted and fined but appealed on the basis that the company had not committed the offence - it had in place a management and supervisory system designed to prevent this type of offence and the failure that resulted in the offence being committed was the failure of the store supervisor, which should not be attributed to the company.
Held The appeal succeeded.  Because the store supervisory manager could not be said to be part of the ‘directing mind and will’ of the company his acts could not be said to be those of the company.  The House of Lords stressed the fictional nature of the corporate legal person and the need to distinguish between:
acts which were actually those of the company; and
acts which were those of an agent or servant of the company but for which the company has some statutory or vicarious liability.
The former category are usually those acts committed by the board of directors or senior management of a company who speak and act for it.  They are its ‘brain’ or its ‘nerve centre’.

==Inchoate Offences==

==Specific Offences==

====Murder====
The crime of murder is committed where a person of sound mind and discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being, and under the queens peace, with intent unlawfully to kill or cause grevious bodily harm.

====Voluntary Manslaughter====
There are three kinds of voluntary manslaughter.  They are provocation, diminished responsibility and suicide pacts.  Voluntary manslaughter is essentially a defence to murder.  A person cannot be charged with voluntary manslaughter, they have to be charged with murder and then raise one of these defences, which reduces the crime to manslaughter.  In the case of provocation, the requirement is that the person was provoked by words or conduct, and that the provocation would have provoked a reasonable person to do the same. The requirement for diminished responsibility is that the defendant was operating under such abnormality of mind  as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions  in committing or being party to a killing. The defence that the killing was a suicide pact requires that the defendant was a party to a suicide pact, and that they killed the victim in pursuance to that suicide pact.  A suicide pact is an agreement between two or more people, having for its object the death of them all, whether or not each is to take his own life. Nothing may be treated as being done in pursuance of a suicide pact, unless when done the person doing the act has the settled intention of dying in  pursuance of the pact.

====Involuntary Manslaughter====
In common law the term ‘involuntary manslaughter’ refers to those instances where the defendant causes death intending neither to kill nor to cause grievous bodily harm. There are currently three types of involuntary manslaughter - manslaughter by gross negligence, constructive manslaughter and killing with subjective recklessness

#Constructive manslaughter
The defendant must have committed an illegal act that resulted in the death of the victim

##Gross Negligence Manslaughter
Must owe a duty of care to the victim.

===Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person===
''Assault''- causing the victim to apprehend immediate unlawful force R v Ireland and Barstow (Section 39 of the criminal justice act '88)

''Battery''- the application of unlawful force, which can be any touching the victim does not consent to- R v Thomas (Section 39 of the criminal justice act '88)

''Assault occasioning Actual Bodily Harm''- any assault or battery which amounts to ABH. This can be psychriatric and physical. Physical ABH must be more than trivial damage, and psychriatric ABH must be more than mere fear and distress, and was defining in the case Chan Fook as 'any injury not so trivial as to be wholly insignificant'. (Section 47 of the Offences Against a Persons Act 1861)

''Malicious wounding or causing grevious bodily harm'' (Section 20 of the Offences Against a Persons Act 1861)

''Malicious wounding or inflicting grevious bodily harm with intent'' (Section 18 of the Offences Against a Persons Act 1861)

===Theft and Related Property Offences===

==Defences==

===Mistake===
===Intoxication===

'''Voluntary Intoxication''' is generally not a defense to the commission of crime.

'''Involuntary Intoxication''', on the other hand, is an affirmative defense on which a defendant bears the burden of proof.  The defendant's burden of proof typically by a preponderance of the evidence, less than the prosecutions burden to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

===Duress===

Duress must be to ones property, family or ones self.

__TOC__

== Description ==

X'Identity is an Ada [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] where X is any task. This attribute returns a unique identifying string (of type &quot;Task_ID&quot;). This string is used in some Ada tasking libraries for task identification. It may also be used directly by the user for output purposes, to determine if two tasks are the same task, etc.

== Example ==

 {{Ada/kw|task}} My_Task;
 {{Ada/kw|task}} My_Other_Task;
 ...
 {{Ada/kw|if}} My_Task'Identity = My_Other_Task'Identity {{Ada/kw|then}}
   {{Ada/--|Do something}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 25x80 related to 0 means success ==
There should be some clarification on how these two rules are related:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''This recommended practice relates also to the 0 means success convention for functions, that we will cover on the Functions Section of this book.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I suspect the original author was implying that short functions generally encourage having only one exit point, but this relationship is not very clear from the text itself (and furthermore, &quot;0 means success&quot; and &quot;one exit point&quot; seem like notably different rules to me).  If someone wants to revise the text to clarify this relationship, please do so; otherwise, I'm tempted to remove it to avoid confusion.

== Links to Style Guides ==

I've edited the introduction with links to style guides, and the got the following reply: [[User:Maxberger|Max]] 22:45, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
----
if in place of adding references to other pages (your last edits on Conventions (Source Code Style)), we created a section on Code Style pages in the external the references and point to it ?
PS: Some of them are of C and Java ?!?
----
Ok, I guess you're right, the links should not go here, but in the reference section. However, the most comon styles should still be named here.

As for they are in C and Java: Yes, unfortunately they are for C and Java, but they are still the most widely used. (at least K&amp;R, GNU and Java). Do you know of any equivalents in c++?

there are more I have one that is very good but it's in PDF and I can't remember were I've put my copy or were did I get it... most can be mined without infringing copyright by simply changing the wording and simplifying, see the talk page on how to avoid abusing (and the limits of) copyrights, other we can contact the authors and get a license to use them I have done so as time allowed on some of the works I've added references, I've kept the emails so to have proof if any problem arises. see also my urls on my page (del.icio.us) btw if you also have a url page I would like to &quot;monitor&quot; it :) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]]

Just looked at these links. They are all nice, but most of them go into a different direction. When I talk about coding style (especially to beginners), it I mean indentation, naming, comments, things like that (just as are on the page). Stroustrup recommends K&amp;R style (and so do I :) ).

Here's an idea: We mention coding styles, give the list in the reference section, and during the explanation, recommend to use K&amp;R style (maybe as a note: We will recoomend K&amp;R, and then another note: We recommend using 2 chars as indentation), but emphasize that persistence is the most important key. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 20:37, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

:I would instead call that &quot;formatting&quot; which is only a minor piece of style. (To me, style implies more questions like: how are things communicated, what gets communicated, what doesn't get communicated?) I go with mostly K&amp;R, except I put the &quot;else {&quot; on its own line instead of sharing it with the &quot;then&quot;s close curly (as in &quot;} else {&quot;) --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:46, 26 September 2005 (UTC)
----
We should agree that we will never agree about the content of this section we should just say what can be done and leave it to the users interpretation, focusing in, as [[User:Maxberger|Max]] said  on the persistence and common agreement,(ie:I could comment code in Mandarin if I would be the only reader), I don't think we should try to sell our tastes or interpretation today that is pointless there are code beautifiers out there, it's like debating the use of tabs or spaces, just pointless, spaces should be used as most of today editors will convert them easily to tabs, another point is the divergence with the use of single char vars names (i,z etc) they can lead to var shadowing and in &quot;running code&quot; (not optimized) can be very hard to find the problem.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:55, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

== C style comments ==
I wanted to change this coloring is awful:

int function() /* This is a comment /*
{              
 return 0;  
}              and this is the same comment */
               so this isn't in the comment, and will give an error*/
The &quot;isn't&quot; starts a red line for some reason, is this a wiki issue?  [[Special:Contributions/203.214.123.244|203.214.123.244]] ([[User talk:203.214.123.244|talk]]) 13:21, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

:I've opened some time ago a similar bug report also on the code highlight filter that Wikibooks use (at sourceforge) IIRC this was not the same bug you have detected now. Go to [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance]] and ask where to place the bug report (I can't remember the project's name). Thanks for detecting and reporting it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:10, 20 January 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Yes/no questions are those questions which can be answered with either a yes or a no in English. For example &quot;Did you go to school today?&quot;. That was a yes/no question because someone answering could answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; and be perfectly understood. An example of a non-yes/no question is: &quot;How was school today?&quot;. If your friend asked you that question and you answered &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; your friend would think you did not hear him.

So how do yes/no questions work. In English yes/no questions start with an auxiliary verb. There are many of these. In English yes/no questions can start with &quot;have&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;did&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, or other auxiliary verbs.
*&quot;have&quot;  ex. Have they come?
*&quot;do&quot;   ex. Do they sleep?
*&quot;did&quot; ex. Did they jump? 
*&quot;will&quot; ex. will you go away?

In Arabic yes/no questions are much simpler to understand, and to make. Every &quot;yes/no&quot; question usually starts with one of two words/semi-words. So

&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;هل &lt;/font&gt;(hal)
*a hamza (either a &quot;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;أ &lt;/font&gt;&quot; (a) OR &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;ء  &lt;/font&gt; (a))
&lt;br&gt;

Both of these work the same way. Both go at the beginning of a question sentence. 

The difference in meaning between هل(hal) and hamza:
#For making &quot;X=Y&quot; sentences into questions. 
*هل (hal) is put at the beginning.
#For making &quot;X!=Y&quot; sentences into questions.
*ء (a) hamza is put at the beginning.
#For &quot;X does (something)&quot; sentences
*A hamza is used when talking about the present
**A hamza would start this sentence: &quot;Are you crying?&quot;.
*hal is used when talking in the non present tense.
**هل (hal) would start this sentence: &quot;Do you cry?&quot;.

So how do we make a question. In Arabic a question can easily be made from a statement(a sentence, that is not a command, nor an exclamation, nor a question).
==X=Y Sentences==
For example, how do we transform the following sentence into a yes/no question.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;الولد صغير&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;al-waladu Sagheer(un)
&lt;br&gt;al-wa-la-du-Sa-gheer
&lt;br&gt;The boy is small.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Simple, just add &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt; هل &lt;/font&gt;(hal) to the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;هل الولد صغير؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;hal al-waladu Sagheer
&lt;br&gt;hal-al-wa-la-du-Sa-gheer
&lt;br&gt;Is the boy small?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now don't forget the basic Arabic word for yes is نعم (na`am) and the basic word for no is لا (laa).


==X!=Y==
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;أليس كذلك؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a laisa ka''dh''aalik
&lt;br&gt;a-lai-sa-ka-''dh''aa-lik
&lt;br&gt;Isn't it like that? OR Right?

==X does (something)==
&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;هل تعمل؟
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;hal ta`mal
&lt;br&gt;hal-ta`-mal
&lt;br&gt;Do you work?

== {{French/Section||The definite article|L'article défini}} ==

The definite article agrees with a specific noun in gender and number. Like other articles (indefinite, partitive) they present a noun. In English, the definite article is always ''the'' (the noun). Unlike English, the French definite article is used also in a general sense, a general statement, or feeling about an idea or thing.

In French, the definite article is dependent on the noun's:
# gender
# plurality
# first letter being a vowel
There are three definite articles and an abbreviation. ''Le'' is used for masculine nouns, ''La'' is used for feminine nouns, ''Les'' is used for plural nouns (both masculine or feminine), and ''L''' is used when the noun begins with a vowel or silent ''h'' (both masculine or feminine). It is similar to English, where ''a'' changes to ''an'' before a vowel.

|-
| les enfants || {{French/Section}} (''lay-zah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;-fah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')|| the children
|}

== {{French/Section||The indefinite article|L'article indéfini}} ==

In English, the indefinite articles are ''a'' and ''an''. While ''some'' is used as a plural article. In French, indefinite articles take on the gender of the noun it precedes if singular, but also has a plural form that is used for either gender. 

{| {{French/Table|audio=French Grammar - The Indefinite Article.ogg|columns=6}}
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | singular
| feminine
! une
| {{fr/IPA|/yn/|approx=ewn}} || une fille || a daughter
|-
| masculine
! un
| {{fr/IPA|/œ̃/|approx=uh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;}} || un fils || a son
|-

! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | des
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | {{fr/IPA|/de/|approx=day}}
| des filles || some daughters
|-
| des fils || some sons

Note that ''des'', like ''les'', is used in French before plural nouns when no article is used in English. For example, you are looking at photographs in an album. The English statement &quot;I am looking at photographs.&quot; cannot be translated to French as &quot;Je regarde photographies&quot; because an article is required to tell which photographs are being looked at. If it is a set of ''specific'' pictures, the French statement should be &quot;Je regarde ''les'' photographies.&quot; (&quot;I am looking at ''the'' photographs.&quot;) . On the other hand, if the person is just randomly browsing the album, the French translation is &quot;Je regarde ''des'' photographies.&quot; (&quot;I am looking at ''some'' photographs.&quot;)

== Partitive article ==

The partitive article ''de'' indicates, among other things, the word ''some''. As for prepositions, ''de le'' contracts (combines) into ''du'', and ''de les'' contracts into ''des''. Also, ''de l''' is used in front of words starting with vowels.

When speaking about food, the partitive article is used sometimes, while the definite article (''le, la, les'') is used at other times, and the indefinite article (''un, une'') in yet another set of situations. In general &quot;de&quot; refers to a ''part'' of food (a ''piece'' of pie) whereas the definite article (le) refers to a food in general (I like pie (in general)). The indefinite article refers to an ''entire unit'' of a food (I would like a (''whole'') pie).

When speaking about preferences, use the definite article:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|J'aime ''la'' glace.||I like ice cream.
|-
|Nous préférons le steak.||We prefer steak.
|-
|Vous aimez les frites||You like French fries.
|}
When speaking about eating or drinking an item, there are specific situations for the use of each article.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
!Def. art.!!specific/whole items
|-
|J'ai mangé ''la'' tarte.||I ate the (whole) pie.
|-
!Ind. art.||known quantity
|-
|J'ai mangé ''une'' tarte.||I ate a pie.
|-
!Part. art.||unknown quantity
|-
|J'ai mangé ''de la'' tarte.||I ate some pie.
|-
|J'ai mangé beaucoup de tarte.||I ate a lot of pie.
|-
|Je n'ai pas mangé les tranches de tarte !||I didn't eat the slices of pie!
|-
!Part. art.||known quantity
|-
|J'ai mangé deux des tartes.||I ate two of the pies.
|}

If the noun taken in a partitive sense happens to be preceded by a qualifying adjective, or a negative verb, then ''de'' is used alone.
* ''un'', ''une'', ''du'', ''de la'', ''des'' change to ''de''.
* for specific quantities;however, the quantity rather than ''de'' is used.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|Nous avons mangé ''une'' tarte.||We ate a pie.
|-
|Nous n'avons pas mangé ''de'' tarte.||We did not eat a pie/ We did not eat any pie.
|-
|Nous n'avons pas mangé deux tartes.||We did not eat two pies
|-
|Nous avons mangé ''de la'' tarte.||We ate some pie.
|-
|Nous n'avons pas mangé de tarte.||We did not eat some pie/ We did not eat any pie.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Smalltalk==
Here is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk wikipedia entry].
===Type===
Smalltalk is a full procedural object oriented language.

All arguments are conceptually references to objects.  All implementations, however, represent small integers within the pointer rather than allocating a physical object for each.

The language does not require implementations to support proper tail recursion, and none of them do.

It was in connection with Smalltalk that the term &quot;object-oriented&quot; first appeared, although the first object-oriented language was Simula 67.

===Execution Entry Point===
Smalltalk programs typically don't have a single entry point but are saved as image files (object memory snapshots). When started, such image files just continue to do whatever they were doing when they were saved.

===General Syntax===
Smalltalk expressions consist of message sends and variable assignments.
 a := b := c + 2 * (x even ifTrue: [y] ifFalse: [z negated]).
Message sends can be either
* unary (in example above: even, negated)
* binary (+, -, etc.)
* keyword (ifTrue:ifFalse:)
Unary messages bind most strongly, then come binary messages, then keyword messages.
Binary messages are evaluated from left to right, there is no operator precedence.
Assignments are evaluated right to left.
Message expressions can be parenthesized.
Angle brackets [] denote blocks. Blocks are first-level objects and can be assigned and passed as parameters.

===Comments===
Smalltalk comments are delimited with the double quote character:
 &quot;This is a comment&quot;
They can span multiple lines.

===Variable Declarations===
Variables have to be declared, but they don't have type information. Method arguments often have their intended role or the expected class in their name.

Temporary variables:
 | x y total subtotal |
Method arguments:
 addAmount: aDecimalNumber purpose: aString
Block arguments:
 [:a :b | a &lt; b]
Block execution:
 [:a :b | a &lt; b] value:1 value: 2
Instance and class variables are declared within the class definition message (details vary between implementations):
 Object subclass: #MyClass
   instanceVariableNames: 'name owner additionalData'
   classVariableNames: 'DataRepository'
Statically scoped variables (globals and class variables) are declared by executing expressions which create them in the system. Examples for this are the class definition messages.

===Method Declaration/Implementation===
Programmers write methods on &lt;i&gt;classes&lt;/i&gt;.  A &lt;i&gt;class&lt;/i&gt; is a Platonic pattern of which objects can be made as instances.  In Smalltalk, each class is also realized as an object, supporting the protocol to make and return a new instance (new).  Classes have global names; all global names start with capital letters.

Note that programming language Self inherits many of the good features of Smalltalk but is conceptually simpler by eliminating the concept of a class.

===Scope===
Smalltalk has global variables, instance variables, temporary variables (to methods), and parameters (to methods).  Blocks also can have parameters.  In most modern implementations, blocks can also have their own temporary variables.  There is also something called pool variables, they have the same lifetime as global variables, but just aren't accessible except in classes that explicitly include the pools (and in hiers of those classes).  Instance variables are not accessible outside the object they belong to; however, programmers often provide access methods, even to variables intended to be private.

In practice, pool and global &quot;variables&quot; are often used for constants.

===Conditional Statements===
Conditional statuements are normal message expressions.
The message receiver is a Boolean value (true or false), and the arguments are blocks.
 a &lt; 10 ifTrue: [self handleSmallValue]. 

 self hasValidInput
   ifTrue: [self processInput]
   ifFalse: [self displayInputFormatError]

===Looping Statements===
Loops are done by sending messages to blocks:
 [stream atEnd] whileFalse: [self process: stream nextLine]

 [a &lt; limit] whileTrue: [a := a + 1]

Iterations over collections are performed with 'do:'
 anArray do: [:each | self doSomethingWith: each]

Counting loops look like this:
 1 to: 10 do: [:i | Transcript show: i printString; cr]

===Output Statements===
As most Smalltalk systems are not command-line oriented, output to &quot;stdout&quot; as such is not normally used.
However, Smalltalk systems normally have a logging window (the Transcript) into which output can be written:
 Transcript show: 'Hello, world!'; cr

===Containers===
The standard Smalltalk library includes an extensive collection of classes of mutable collections: Array, OrderedCollection (in which it is efficient to append or delete from either end, and in which storage is economical (as an array rather than a linked list or a tree), Set, Bag, Dictionary, IdentityDictionary, SortedCollection.  Collections support useful second-order functions collect: (like map in Lisp), select:, detect:, and reject:, and the second-order procedure do:.

Since Smalltalk is dynamically typed, so are its containers; they may point to any mix of objects of any types.

===Algorithms===
&lt;List algorithms or references to lists of algorithms available natively for this language.  List ways to incorporate algorithms if they are not native to the language.  Or, if not available, describe that.&gt;
===Garbage collection===
Garbage collection is automatic.

Some implementations support weak references.

===Physical Structure===
Traditional Smalltalk-80 systems consist of:
* runtime engine (interpreter or JIT plus primitives and platform interfaces)
* image file
* 'changes' file (log of source code and evaluated expressions)
* 'sources' file (source code for the methods in the initial image)

More modern systems often split up the runtime engine into an executable plus shared libraries, and may have additional files for version control systems etc.

===Tips===
Don't try too hard to keep your old habits. You can write Pascal-style programs in Smalltalk, but they won't be good Smalltalk programs.

Keep behavior with those objects most central to it. It's often good to anthropomorphize your objects and write comments in the first person such as:

 addEntry: anEntry
   &quot;Add anEntry to my list of entries. If the entry conflicts with another entry, I will drop the older one.&quot;
   
   entries removeAllSuchThat: [:oldEntry | anEntry conflictsWith: oldEntry].
   entries add: anEntry

===Web References===
A great resource of Free Books on Smalltalk [http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/]

===Books and Articles===
&lt;List additional books and articles that may be helpful. Please include for what level reader the references are appropriate. (beginner/intermediate/advanced)&gt;

This is half a dile que no (or cross body), followed by a sharp right turn for
the followers under the leader's left arm, to return to where it started.

This is a fast right turn, and feels strange to followers who are used to either
Cuban or New York style salsa, so the leaders need to be clear, and patient.
The follower's footwork is similar to a right turn in New York style, or a
right-handed hammerlock in Cuban.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the User Guide for [http://exelearning.net eXeLearning], a program for creating courses for electronic distribution. The program can be found at http://exelearning.org and new releases from http://exelearning.net

== Chapter 1 Introducing eXe ==

=== Backgrounding eXe ===

The eLearning XHTML editor (eXe) is a web-based authoring environment designed to assist teachers and academics in the design, development and publishing of web-based learning and teaching materials without the need to become proficient in HTML, XML or complicated web-publishing applications.

The Web is a revolutionary educational tool because it presents teachers and learners with a technology that simultaneously provides something to talk about (content) and the means to hold the conversation (interaction). Unfortunately, the power of this hypertext medium is constrained in educational settings because the vast majority of teachers and academics do not have the technical skills to build their own web pages, and must therefore rely on the availability of web developers to generate professional looking online content. The eXe is being developed to overcome a number of identified limitations:

* Traditionally web-authoring software entails a steep learning curve; it is not intuitive and &lt;br&gt; the applications were not designed for publishing learning content. Consequently teachers and&lt;br&gt; academics have not adopted these technologies for publishing online learning content.&lt;br&gt; eXe aims to provide an intuitive, easy-to-use tool that will enable teachers to publish professional &lt;br&gt;web pages for learning;
* Currently, learning management systems do not offer sophisticated authoring tools for web content (when compared to the capabilities of web-authoring software or the skills of an experienced web developer). eXe is a tool that provides professional web-publishing capabilities that will be easily referenced or imported by standards compliant learning management systems;
* Most content management and learning management systems utilize a centralized web server model thus requiring connectivity for authoring. This is limiting for authors with low bandwidth connectivity or no connectivity at all. eXe will be developed as an offline authoring tool without the requirement for connectivity.
* Many content management and learning management systems do not provide an intuitive wysiwyg environment where authors can see what their content will look like in a browser when published, especially when working offline. eXe will mimic wysiwig functionality enabling users to see what the content will look like when published online.

=== Overview of eXe tools ===

With the eXe, users can develop a learning structure that suits their content delivery needs and build a resource that is flexible and easily updated. The Outline pane of the eXe Control Panel enables users to design an outline that reflects their own preferred hierarchical structure and taxonomy, i.e. topics-sections-units, or books-chapters-verses, etc. This can be established at the outset or can develop as the resource is built.

The iDevice (instructional device) pane consists of a collection of structural elements that describe learning content. Some of these include, objectives, pre-knowledge, case studies, free text. Learning content is compiled by selecting iDevices from the iDevice menu and entering your learning content. A learning resource may consist of as few or as many iDevices as required to deliver the learning content effectively. New iDevices are in development and recommendations for additional iDevices are being sought from the wider learning community. An iDevice editor enabling users to design their own iDevices and templates has been released in an experimental format as work continues on its development.

eXe offers the ability for users to customise their published content by selecting from a range of graphical style sheets.
 
eXe’s Export facility allows content to be packaged in two ways. Learning resources can be packaged as a self contained web site for publishing to a web server, or as a SCORM Content Package which will enable the resource to be imported into any SCORM enabled learning management system (LMS).

== Chapter 2 Starting exe ==

=== Windows ===

To start the eXe, double-click the eXe icon that should have appeared on your desktop after installation. If you don't have an eXe icon on your desktop you will need to find the application's icon in your Windows start menu under Programs.  You should probably maximise the eXe window to utilise all the space you have available to work in.

=== Linux ===

Type run-exe.sh (all lower case) from the command line. This will launch eXe.


== Chapter 3 - Building a resource ==

This chapter is designed to guide you through using the tools in this application to produce your own learning resources.
Submit

=== Objectives ===

At the conclusion of this tutorial you will be able to:

* Use the outline tool set to structure a resource
* Select iDevices and add content to a resource
* Apply a new style to a resource.

=== Section 1 - Defining Properties ===

The Properties tab allows you to record general details about your project e.g. Title, Author, and Description. It also allows you to define the taxonomy you may prefer to use to describe the different components or levels within the resource.

==== Activity ====

To begin this activity with eXe open (see Chapter 3- Starting eXe).

1. Select the Properties tab (at the top of the authoring workspace)
2. Type a title for this resource in the Title field e.g. eXe Tutorial.
3. Type in the author details and a brief description of the resource in the space provided
4. Change the taxonomy to Module, Section, Map. (The taxonomy determines the naming convention for the different levels in the outline.)
5. Click &lt;Done&gt;
6. Return to the Authoring tab.

=== Section 2 - Defining an outline ===

==== Preknowledge ====

You should have completed Section 1 - Defining Properties and set the properties for your package.

The Outline tool set allows you to define the structure your project will take. This is particularly useful for large or complex projects that contain many parts or topics. On startup the authoring pane displays to the right of the eXe sidebar. The outline pane displays two defaultdnodes, draft and home.

===== Home =====

The Home node is the first page displayed when the project is exported to the web or an LMS. This is a parent node and additional child level nodes can be added under this node.

===== Adding nodes =====

To add additional nodes select the parent node by highlighting the parent level and click the Add Child button (on some systems this is shown as &quot;Add Page&quot;).

===== Delete nodes =====

To delete a node select the node you want to delete and click the delete button. A dialogue message displays to check this action. Click OK to continue.

===== Renaming nodes =====

Select the node you want to rename and double click. A dialogue message prompts you to enter the new name. Enter the name and click OK. This action can also be done using the Rename button

===== Promote/Demote arrows =====

The promote/demote arrows are located beneath the outline pane. Selecting a node and clicking on one of the arrows will change the position of that node with the outline structure.

==== Activity ====

Now try adding a new Module to your project. To do this click on the parent node you want the new &quot;child&quot; module to be associated with and click the &lt;Add Child&gt; button. Select the new module and double click or click &lt;Rename&gt;. Add a title, in this case call it eXe Tutorial.

=== Section 3 - Selecting iDevices ===

==== Preknowledge ====

You should have completed Section 2 - Defining an outline.

iDevices are instructional elements that provide a framework within which to set your content.
{|
| Activity || An activity can be defined as a task or set of tasks a learner must complete. Provide a clear statement of the task and consider any conditions that may help or hinder the learner in the performance of the task.
|-
| Attachment || The Attachment iDevice allows you to place files, e.g. pdf, ppt, etc., within your content that you want learners to be able to access.
|-
| Case Study || A case study is a story that conveys an educational message. A case study can be used to present a realistic situation that enables learners to apply their own knowledge and experience to. When designing a case study you might want to consider the following:
* What educational points are conveyed in the story
* What preparation will the learners need to do prior to working on the case study
* Where the case study fits into the rest of the course
* How the learners will interact with the materials and each other e.g. if run in a classroom situation can teams be setup to work on different aspects of the case and if so how are ideas feed back to the class.
|-
| Free Text Area || The majority of a learning resource will be establishing context, delivering instructions and providing general information. This provides the framework within which the learning activities are built and delivered.
|-
| Image with Text || Graphic representations with explanation can provide emotional (affective) and learning task (cognitive) dimensions to the learning.
|-
| Multiple choice choice Question
| Although more often used in formal testing situations MCQs can be used as a testing tool to stimulate thought and discussion on topics students may feel a little reticent in responding to.
When designing a MCQ test consider the following:
* What are the learning outcomes are the questions testing
* What intellectual skills are being tested
* What are the language skills of the audience
* Gender and cultural issues
* Avoid grammar language and question structures that might provide clues
|-
| Objectives || Objectives describe the expected outcomes of the learning and should define what the learners will be able to do when they have completed the learning tasks.
|-
| Preknowledge
| Prerequisite knowledge refers to the knowledge learners should already have in order to be able to effectively complete the learning. Examples of pre-knowledge can be:
* Learners must have level 4 English
* Learners must be able to assemble standard power tools
|-
| Reading Activity || Provide learners with structure to their reading activity. This helps put the activity in context for the learner. It is also important to correctly reference any reading materials you refer to as this models best practice to the learners.

=Acoustic transducer=


The purpose of an acoustic transducer is to convert electrical energy into acoustic energy. Many variations of acoustic transducers exist, such as electrostatic, balanced armature and moving-coil loudspeakers. This article focuses on moving-coil loudspeakers since they are the most commonly used type of acoustic transducer. First, the physical construction and principle of a typical moving coil transducer are discussed briefly. Second, electro-mechano-acoustical modeling of each element composing the loudspeaker is presented in a tutorial way to reinforce and supplement the theory on [[Engineering_Acoustics/Electro-Mechanical_Analogies|electro-mechanical analogies]] and [[Engineering_Acoustics/Electro-acoustic_analogies|electro-acoustic analogies]] previously seen in other sections. Third, the equivalent circuit is analyzed to introduce the theory behind Thiele-Small parameters, which are very useful when designing loudspeaker enclosures. A method to experimentally determine Thiele-Small parameters is also included.


==Moving-coil loudspeaker construction and principle==

The classic moving-coil loudspeaker driver can be divided into three key components:


1) The magnet motor drive system, comprising the permanent magnet, the center pole and the voice coil acting together to produce a mechanical force on the diaphragm from an electrical current.


2) The loudspeaker cone system, comprising the diaphragm and dust cap, permitting mechanical force to be translated into acoustic pressure;


3) The loudspeaker suspension, comprising the spider and surround, preventing the diaphragm from breaking due to over excursion, allowing only translational movement and tending to bring the diaphragm back to its rest position. 


The following illustration shows a cut-away view of a typical moving coil-permanent magnet loudspeaker. A coil is mechanically coupled to a diaphragm, also called cone, and rests in a fixed magnetic field produced by a magnet. When an electrical current flows through the coil, a corresponding magnetic field is emitted, interacting with the fixed field of the magnet and thus applying a force to the coil, pushing it away or towards the magnet. Since the cone is mechanically coupled to the coil, it will push or pull the air it is facing, causing pressure changes and emitting a sound wave. 


&lt;center&gt; [[Image:MovingCoilLoudspeaker.png|800px]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 1: A cross-sectional view of a typical moving-coil loudspeaker &lt;/center&gt;


An equivalent circuit can be obtained to model the loudspeaker as a lumped system.  This circuit can be used to drive the design of a complete loudspeaker system, including an enclosure and sometimes even an amplifier that is matched to the properties of the driver. The following section shows how such an equivalent circuit can be obtained.

==Electro-mechano-acoustical equivalent circuit==

Electro-mechanico-acoustical systems such as loudspeakers can be modeled as equivalent electrical circuits as long as each element moves as a whole. This is usually the case at low frequencies or at frequencies where the dimensions of the system are small compared to the wavelength of interest. To obtain a complete model of the loudspeaker, the interactions and properties of electrical, mechanical, and acoustical subsystems composing the loudspeaker driver must each be modeled. The following sections detail how the circuit may be obtained starting with the amplifier and ending with the acoustical load presented by air. A similar development can be found in [1] or [2].

===Electrical subsystem===

The electrical part of the system is composed of a driving amplifier and a voice coil. Most amplifiers can be approximated as a perfect voltage source in series with the amplifier output impedance. The voice coil exhibits an inductance and a resistance that may be directly modeled as a circuit.


&lt;center&gt; [[Image:ElectricalSubsystemLoudspeaker.png|400px]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 2: The amplifier and loudspeaker electrical elements modeled as a circuit &lt;/center&gt;


===Electrical to mechanical subsystem===

When the loudspeaker is fed an electrical signal, the voice coil and magnet convert current to force. Similarly, voltage is related to the velocity. This relationship between the electrical side and the mechanical side can be modeled by a transformer.


&lt;math&gt; \tilde{f_c} = Bl \tilde{i} &lt;/math&gt;;          &lt;math&gt; \tilde{u_c} = \dfrac{\tilde{e}}{Bl} &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;center&gt; [[Image: ElectricalToMechanicalLoudspeaker.png]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 3: A transformer modeling transduction from the electrical impedance to mechanical mobility analogy &lt;/center&gt;


===Mechanical subsystem===

In a first approximation, a moving coil loudspeaker may be thought of as a mass-spring system where the diaphragm and the voice coil constitute the mass and the spider and surround constitute the spring element. Losses in the suspension can be modeled as a resistor. 


&lt;center&gt; [[Image:MechanicalSubsystemModelingLoudspeaker.png|1000px]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt; Figure 4: Mass spring system and associated circuit analogies of the impedance and mobility type.&lt;/center&gt;


The equation of motion gives us :


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \tilde{f_c} = R_m \tilde{u_c} + \dfrac{\tilde{u_c}}{ j \omega C_{MS}} + j \omega M_{MD} \tilde{u_c} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \dfrac{\tilde{f_c} }{\tilde{u_c}}= R_m+\dfrac{1}{ j \omega C_{MS}}+ j\omega M_{MD} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Which yields the mechanical impedance type analogy in the form of a series RLC circuit. A parallel RLC circuit may also be obtained to get the mobility analog following mathematical manipulation: 


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \dfrac{\tilde{u_c} }{\tilde{f_c}}= \dfrac{1}{R_m+\dfrac{1}{ j \omega C_{MS}}+ j\omega M_{MD} }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \dfrac{\tilde{u_c} }{\tilde{f_c}}= \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{1}{G_m}+\dfrac{1}{ j \omega C_{MS}} + \dfrac{1}{\dfrac{1}{j \omega M_{MD}}}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Which expresses the mechanical mobility type analogy in the form of a parallel RLC circuit where the denominator elements are respectively a parallel conductance, inductance, and compliance.


===Mechanical to acoustical subsystem===

A loudspeaker’s diaphragm may be thought of as a piston that pushes and pulls on the air facing it, converting mechanical force and velocity into acoustic pressure and volume velocity. The equations are as follow:


&lt;math&gt; \tilde{P_d} = \dfrac{\tilde{f_c}}{\tilde{S_D}} &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; \tilde{U_c} = \tilde{u_c}{S_D}&lt;/math&gt;


These equations can be modeled by a transformer.


&lt;center&gt; [[Image:MechanicalToAcousticalLoudspeaker.png]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 5: A transformer modeling the transduction from mechanical mobility to acoustical mobility analogy performed by a loudspeaker's diaphragm &lt;/center&gt;


===Acoustical subsystem===

The impedance presented by the air load on the loudspeaker's diaphragm is both resistive due to sound radiation and reactive due to the air mass that is being pushed radially but does not contribute to sound radiation to the far field. The air load on the diaphragm can be modeled as an impedance or an admittance. Specific values and approximations can be found in [1], [2] or [3]. Note that the air load depends on the mounting conditions of the loudspeaker. If the loudspeaker is mounted in a baffle, the air load will be the same on each side of the diaphragm. Then, if the air load on one side is &lt;math&gt; Y_{AR} &lt;/math&gt; in the admittance analogy, then the total air load is &lt;math&gt; Y_{AR}/2 &lt;/math&gt; as both loads are in parallel.

===Complete electro-mechano-acoustical equivalent circuit===

Using electrical impedance, mechanical mobility and acoustical admittance yield the following equivalent circuit, modeling the entire loudspeaker drive unit.


&lt;center&gt; [[Image: LoudspeakerEquivalentCircuit.png|1000px]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 6: A complete electro-mechano-acoustical equivalent circuit of a loudspeaker drive unit&lt;/center&gt;


This circuit can be reduced by substituting the transformers and connected loads by an equivalent loading that would present the same impedance as the loaded transformer. An example of this is shown on figure 7, where acoustical and electrical loads and sources have been &quot;brought over&quot; to the mechanical side.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:LoudspeakerEquivalentCircuitMechanical.png|900px]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 7: Mechanical equivalent circuit modeling of a loudspeaker drive unit&lt;/center&gt;


The advantage of doing such manipulations is that we can then directly relate electrical measurements with elements in the circuit. This will later allow us to obtain values for the different components of the model and match this model to real loudspeaker drivers. We can further simplify this circuit by using Norton's theorem and converting the series electrical components and voltage source into an equivalent current source and parallel electrical components. Then, using a technique called the Dot method, presented in section [[Engineering_Acoustics/Solution_Methods:_Electro-Mechanical_Analogies|Solution Methods: Electro-Mechanical Analogies]], we can obtain a single loop series circuit which is the dual of the parallel circuit previously obtained with Norton's theorem. If we are mainly interested in the low frequency behavior of the loudspeaker, as should be the case when using lumped element modeling, we can neglect the effect of the voice coil inductance, which has an effect only at high frequencies. Furthermore, the air load impedance at low frequencies is mass-like and can be modeled by a simple inductance &lt;math&gt;M_{M1}&lt;/math&gt;. This results in a simplified low frequency model equivalent circuit, shown of figure 8, which is easier to manipulate than the circuit of figure 7. Note that the analogy used for this circuit is of the impedance type.


&lt;center&gt; [[Image:LowFrequencyLoudspeakerEquivalentCircuitMechanical.png|800px]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 8: Low frequency approximation mechanical equivalent circuit of a loudspeaker drive unit&lt;/center&gt;


Where &lt;math&gt;M_{M1} = 2.67 a^3 \rho &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the loudspeaker and &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt;, the density of air. Mass elements, in this case the mass of the diaphragm and voice coil &lt;math&gt;M_{MS}&lt;/math&gt; and the air mass loading the diaphragm &lt;math&gt;2M_{M1}&lt;/math&gt; can be regrouped in a single element:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; M_{MS} = M_{MD}+2M_{M1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


==Thiele-Small Parameters==

===Theory===

The complete low frequency behavior of a loudspeaker drive unit can be modeled with just six parameters, called Thiele-Small parameters. Most of these parameters result from algebraic manipulation of the equations of the circuit of figure 8. Loudspeaker driver manufacturers seldom provide electro-mechano-acoustical parameters directly and rather provide Thiele-Small parameters in datasheets, but conversion from one to the other is quite simple. The Thiele-Small parameters are as follow:


1. &lt;math&gt; R_e &lt;/math&gt;, the voice coil DC resistance;

2. &lt;math&gt; Q_{ES} &lt;/math&gt;, the electrical Q factor;

3. &lt;math&gt; Q_{MS} &lt;/math&gt;, the mechanical Q factor;

4. &lt;math&gt; f_s &lt;/math&gt;, the loudspeaker resonance frequency;

5. &lt;math&gt; S_D &lt;/math&gt;, the effective surface area of the diaphragm;

6. &lt;math&gt; V_{AS} &lt;/math&gt;, the equivalent suspension volume: the volume of air that has the same acoustic compliance as the suspension of the loudspeaker driver.


These parameters can be related directly from the low frequency approximation circuit of figure 8, with &lt;math&gt; R_e &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S_D &lt;/math&gt; being explicit.


&lt;math&gt; Q_{MS} = \dfrac{1}{R_{MS}} \sqrt{\dfrac{M_{MS}}{C_{MS}}} &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; Q_{ES} = \dfrac{R_g + R_e }{(Bl)^2} \sqrt{\dfrac{M_{MS}}{C_{MS}}} &lt;/math&gt; ; &lt;math&gt;f_s= \dfrac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{M_{MS}C_{MS}}}&lt;/math&gt;;  &lt;math&gt;V_{AS}= C_{MS}S_D^2\rho c^2&lt;/math&gt;


Where &lt;math&gt;\rho c^2&lt;/math&gt; is the Bulk modulus of air. It follows that, if given Thiele-Small parameters, one can extract the values of each component of the circuit of figure 8 using the following equations :


&lt;math&gt; C_{MS} = \dfrac{V_{AS}}{S_D^2 \rho c^2} &lt;/math&gt;;  &lt;math&gt;M_{MS}= \dfrac{1}{(2 \pi f_s)^2 C_{MS}}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;R_{MS} = \dfrac{1}{Q_{MS}}\sqrt{\dfrac{M_{MS}}{C_{MS}}}&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;Bl = \sqrt{\dfrac{R_e}{2 \pi f_s Q_{ES} C_{MS} } }&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;M_{MD}= M_{MS}-2M_{M1}&lt;/math&gt;;

===Measurement===

Many methods can be used to measure Thiele-Small parameters of drivers. Measurement of Thiele-Small parameters is sometimes necessary if a manufacturer does not provide them. Also, the actual Thiele-Small parameters of a given loudspeaker can differ from nominal values significantly. The method described in this section comes from [2]. Note that for this method, the loudspeaker is considered to be mounted in an infinite baffle. In practice, a baffle with a diameter of four times that of the loudspeaker is sufficient. Measurements without a baffle are also possible: the air mass loading will simply be halved and can be easily accounted for. The setup for this method includes an FFT analyzer or a mean to obtain an impedance curve. A signal generator of variable frequency and an AC meter can also be used.


&lt;center&gt; [[Image:Setup to measure impedance of loudspeakers.png |300px]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 9: Simple experimental setup to measure the impedance of a loudspeaker drive unit&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; Z_{spk}= R\dfrac{V_{spk}}{V_s \left( 1-\dfrac{V_{spk}}{V_s} \right)} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt; [[Image:ImpedanceCurveLoudspeaker.png |600px]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 10: A typical loudspeaker drive unit impedance curve&lt;/center&gt;


Once the impedance curve of the loudspeaker is measured, &lt;math&gt; R_e &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f_s &lt;/math&gt; can be directly identified by looking at the low frequency asymptote of the impedance value and the center frequency of the resonance peak. If the frequencies where &lt;math&gt;Z_{spk}=\sqrt{R_e R_c}&lt;/math&gt; are identified as &lt;math&gt;f_l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_h&lt;/math&gt;, Q factors can be calculated.


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; Q_{MS}= \dfrac{f_s}{f_h-f_l} \sqrt{\dfrac{R_c}{R_e}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; Q_{ES} = \dfrac{Q_{MS}}{\dfrac{R_c}{R_e}-1} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;math&gt;S_D&lt;/math&gt; can simply be approximated by &lt;math&gt;\pi a^2 &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the loudspeaker driver. The last remaining Thiele-Small parameter, &lt;math&gt;V_{AS}&lt;/math&gt; is slightly trickier to measure. The idea is to either increase mass or reduce compliance of the loudspeaker drive unit and note the shift in resonance frequency. If a known mass &lt;math&gt;M_x&lt;/math&gt; is added to the loudspeaker diaphragm, the new resonance frequency will be:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f^'_s= \dfrac{1}{2 \pi \sqrt{(M_{MS} + M_x) C_{MS} } }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


And the equivalent suspension volume may be obtained with:


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;V_{AS} =  \left( 1- \dfrac{f^{'2}_s}{f_s^2} \right) \dfrac{S_D^2 \rho c^2}{(2 \pi f^'_s)^2 M_x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Hence, all Thiele-Small parameters modeling the low frequency behavior of the loudspeaker drive unit can be obtained from a fairly simple setup. These parameters are of tremendous help in loudspeaker enclosure design.

===Numerical example===

This section presents a numerical example of obtaining Thiele-Small parameters from impedance curves. The impedance curves presented in this section have been obtained from simulations using nominal Thiele-Small parameters of a real woofer loudspeaker. Firsy, these Thiele-Small parameters have been transformed into an electro-mechano-acoustical circuit using the equation presented before. Second, the circuit was treated as a black box and the method to extract Thiele-Small parameters was used. The purpose of this simulation is to present the method, step by step, using realistic values so that the reader can get more familiar with the process, the magnitude of the values and with what to expect when performing such measurements.


For this simulation, a loudspeaker of radius &lt;math&gt;a=6.55cm&lt;/math&gt; is mounted on a baffle sufficiently large to act as an infinite baffle. Its impedance is obtained and plotted in figure 11, where important cursors have already been placed.



&lt;center&gt; [[Image:SimulatedImpedanceWoofer.png |1000px]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 11: Simulated measurement of an impedance curve for a woofer loudspeaker&lt;/center&gt;


The low frequency asymptote is immediately identified as &lt;math&gt;Re=6.6\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. The resonance is clear and centered at &lt;math&gt;fs=33Hz&lt;/math&gt;. The value of the impedance at this frequency is about &lt;math&gt;66\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. This yields &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{R_eR_c}=20.8\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, which occurs at &lt;math&gt;f_l=19.5 Hz&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_h= 52.5 Hz&lt;/math&gt;. With this information, we can compute some of the Thiele-Small parameters.


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; Q_{MS}= \dfrac{f_s}{f_h-f_l}\sqrt{\dfrac{R_c}{R_e}}=\dfrac{33}{52.5-19.5}*\sqrt{\dfrac{66}{6.6}}= 3.1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; Q_{ES} = \dfrac{Q_{MS}}{\dfrac{R_c}{R_e}-1} = \dfrac{3.1}{\dfrac{66}{6.6}-1} = 0.35&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


As a next step, a mass of &lt;math&gt;M_x=10g&lt;/math&gt; is fixed to the loudspeaker diaphragm. This shifts the resonance frequency and yields a new impedance curve, as shown on figure 12.


&lt;center&gt; [[Image:SimulatedImpedanceWooferAddedMass.png |1000px]]&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;Figure 12: Simulated measurement of an impedance curve for a woofer loudspeaker&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S_{D} =  \pi a^2 = 0.0135 m^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;V_{AS} =  \left( 1- \dfrac{27.5^2}{33^2} \right) \dfrac{0.0135^2*1.18*344^2}{(2 \pi 27.5)^2*0.01}= 0.0272 m^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Once all six Thiele-Small parameters have been obtained, it is possible to calculate values for the electro-mechano-acoustical circuit modeling elements of figure 6 or 7. From then, the design of an enclosure can start. This is discussed in application sections [[Engineering_Acoustics/Sealed_Box_Subwoofer_Design|Sealed box subwoofer design]] and [[Engineering Acoustics/Bass Reflex Enclosure Design|Bass reflex enclosure design]].

This is Old Word Wolf, again:  I added a long, detailed section with genuine, classroom-tested strategies for finding a topic as part of the prewriting stage.  My contribution was summarily deleted withing seconds without comment or notice as to why -- apparently a unilateral decision by one wikipedian.  My contribution directly addressed the &quot;dry&quot; quality noted below, as well as getting quickly into the meat of the matter -- helping college students at the prewriting stage of locating a topic. 

Further, the suggestion, later in the same section, of sending the freshman composition class writer to the library to research scholarly articles on Shakespeare would be laughable if it weren't so misguided. There is no faster way to discourage independent thinking and create a complete &quot;writer's block&quot; than by having a freshman try to sort out the gazillions of articles on just Hamlet or Julius Caesar or Midsummer Night's Dream, much less all the rest of the plays and sonnets.  Modern freshman-composition classes are designed to help more than just the budding English major, as many of my deleted examples attempted to show. 

I've taught Freshman writing for nearly 30 years, have half that number of years as a practicing journalist, and have ghost written memoirs, and edited scores of theses and dissertations.



-----

I have an uncomfortable feeling that the first few pages are all rather dry, and reflect what an old-school textbook or instructor would say (or be afraid not to say). I have a few ideas but they're not terribly well thought through yet. I'll throw them out here while my impressions are fresh and hope to get some feedback.

1. Regarding presentation, I think graphics are necessary. Maybe to start with a chart of the writing process as you/we/whoever set up the present outline see(s) it. If MediaWiki can't handle graphics then, troublesome though it may be, a switch to WikkaWiki or any other that handles graphics may be in order.

2. Also regarding presentation, as I see it the collaborative editability of wikis is being exploited nicely, but their radical hypertextuality isn't. Although a reader can click on any of the headings or subheadings, at the moment this is very much a linear-hierarchical textbook. I think we need to provide multiple entry points. For example, when I am working on a paper I have quite a few vague ideas but feel intimidated to actually start writing. I also get very tense. So a nice method for me is to get a very large sheet of paper and some colored pens and do some mind mapping. So I would like to be taken to a section on that right away, rather than have to search for a tiny mention of clustering at the bottom of a page fairly deep in. (I guess I'm conflating my argument about presentation with my preferences on approach.) Without some kind of preferred linear path, some people might get lost. But a little bit of &quot;random access&quot; or multiple paths might be useful, too (something beyond the random module feature).

3. The content does seem very neutral and somewhat dull. I think this is a result of a very healthy desire not to make a general textbook too quirky. But I think it might be possible to make something that can be individual while covering all the expected bases by addressing my point 2.

4. Meta-discussions like this can get lost very easily when attached to a single page. There needs to be a separate space provided, and by default a wiki doesn't do that. Could there be a &quot;Debating the overall structure&quot; page or something along those lines? This point has been addressed briefly on Matt's blog, too. Without explicitly encouraging and supporting that kind of debate, the only way to change overall structure is to just go ahead and do it, possibly upsetting a lot of people. Because people are reluctant to mess up already good work, there's a high possibility that whoever had the initiative to come up with some kind of structure at the beginning will end up unwittingly dictating the ultimate shape of the whole book. And it's not just a question of reticence. I think when we see a structure already in place we subconsciously assume that is the optimal structure and censor out alternatives from our own mind.

I don't know how much sense this makes, but I hope it sparks a debate soon, because I do sense that a great opportunity could be missed here without it. [RickL]

I'd like to see examples here of brainstorming and freewriting. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 20:00, 8 December 2005 (UTC)

----
I see a few things that need to be addressed here. I deleted the rather archaic &quot;writing steps&quot; section, since that's long been discredited in the literature. The chapter also appears to need editing for tone and style to make it more consistent. Compare the language in the overview with the advice for free writing. Lots to do here:
* Add links or reference to the research chapter. 
* Talking about mind mapping and finding topics by talking to peers
* Burke's pentad is often used as a way to generate ideas for writing --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 20:13, 1 November 2007 (UTC)

This is Old Word Wolf speaking.  Off topic: I've tried to &quot;log in&quot; several times but after being told I'm in, when I get to the page I'm told I'm not. 

On Topic:  The planning and prewriting section is weak because it spends too much time discussing the fact that it's hard to start.  Students know this.  The section needs dive into ways to solve the problem and stop swimming around in the morass of experiencing the problem.

I've also deleted some references to &quot;the author.&quot;  The stated audience of this composition text is first-year college students, and I think the text should -- esp. on first references -- reinforce this connection. In this spirit, I deleted from this section three or four long sentences in the first graf describing an author's query letter to a publisher. Wrong audience. Apologies to the original writer; no offense intended.

More later.

==Outline==

Let me try to sum up the outline as it currently stands, to help structuring the page.

* Overview of Planning and Prewriting
** Finding a '''Topic'''
** Discovering '''Ideas''' (Generating ideas?)
*** Brainstorming
**** Postpone criticism
*** Clustering
*** Freewriting
**** Welcome petty mistakes
** Dealing with '''Writing Anxiety'''
** Determining Your '''Audience'''
** Developing an '''Outline'''

The outline is structured not as the page is but as the topics covered are structured, or so I tried. A futher detail can be added, picking the points from the body text. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:30, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

== Matt's Thoughts on This Section ==

Just reading over the overview part, I was reminded of the book They Say, I Say by Graff, Birkenstein, and Durst. They talk a lot about how students struggle because they don't see scholarship as a big conversation they can take part in. Instead they think in terms of originality or personal opinions about a &quot;hot-button&quot; issue. I'd like to see this chapter advising students to see their essays in a context of other works of scholarship; as a contribution to an existing discourse. If a student becomes aware of a discourse and its points of contention, finding a topic becomes much easier. Furthermore, it makes it easier to select sources, tone, style, and so on.

I'd be okay with losing the &quot;generating ideas&quot; section altogether. I don't know any professional writers who use brainstorming, clustering, or freewriting. Again, the problem of finding a topic goes away once a student becomes aware of a discourse and isn't writing in a vacuum. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] ([[User talk:Mattbarton.exe|talk]]) 22:00, 13 January 2011 (UTC)

== Matt H's thoughts ==

	“''A relatively new way to get feedback is through the Internet. Numerous discussion boards, forums and blog sites provide an opportunity to compose a sentence, paragraph or even longer &quot;draft&quot; about your ideas''.” – Some hyperlinked examples of such sites would be helpful.


	“''Without a concrete plan, writers may find themselves repeating information, referring the reader to nonexistent passages, or begin stating incomplete passages to a hopelessly confused reader''.” – To achieve present participle consistency (if I said that correctly), shouldn’t it be, “… ''or beginning to state'' [write?] ''incomplete passages to a hopelessly confused reader''”? Come to think of it, if I understand the aforementioned sentence correctly, it might be clearer to say, “… ''or offering incomplete passages that confuse the reader''.”


	“''Fortunately, there are sound strategies that can help to solve these problems''.” – “to” can be omitted.


	“''The discussion will begin with some prewriting strategies that can help you discover the best topics for your papers''.” – I think it would sound better to say either “''This discussion'' …” or even “''This section'' …”


	“''Next, some strategies will be given to help you reduce writer's block or writing anxiety. Finally, you will be given tips on how to best plan your draft and reduce the likelihood of composing confusing or incoherent documents''.” – I am not vehemently opposed to passive voice, but I think it deflates the effectiveness of the above two sentences. What do you think about writing this entry at least partly in first person?


	“''Keeping these questions in mind while you are writing will help you to develop and produce your ideas efficiently in a limited period of time''.” – I prefer, “''While you are writing, keeping these questions in mind will help you develop and produce'' [is there a better word?] ''your ideas quickly and efficiently''.&quot;


	This wiki book was written mostly by students, correct? Regarding the general tone, would it be acceptable, then, for the tone to be inconsistent among the different sections? Additionally, will this book, or has it already been, promoted as the work of students, and if so, what are the potential pros and cons of virtually publishing a book that many may disregard because of the perceived amateur status of its authors?


	“''Developing an outline, such as the examples below, can be helpful because you can keep an overview of what you want to say, check whether you have covered everything, and find what is out of scope and should be excluded. The outline can grow during the process of writing the body text as you extend it with new points coming to mind during the process''.” – “''Developing an outline, such as the examples below, can be helpful because'' …” 

This feels grammatically incorrect. How about this instead:

	“''Outlines allow you to create, and reference, an overview of what you want to say, check whether you have covered everything, and determine what is out of scope and should therefore be excluded. The outline can grow during the process of writing the body text as you extend it with new points coming to mind during the process'' [I think this last sentence needs rewording]. ''Below are two examples of simple and effective outlines'':”

== Emily's Thoughts ==

I agree that this section does not offer what students really want to hear when writing. Dr. Barton's suggestion to replace this section with a more proactive stance regarding contributions to the academic community would be extremely beneficial for anyone to hear.  

If this section should stay put, I would suggest condensing it. Speaking from a personal standpoint, when reading text on a computer I tend to read the first screen. Anything I must scroll to I end up skimming.  If the ideas in this sections stay, could they be briefly mentioned with links elsewhere if students want more information?  For example, the section could give a brief intro with a list of &quot;Prewriting Tips&quot; that would link to more specific examples?

== Karl's Thoughts ==

As per the meeting with Dr. Barton on Feb 2nd, during the semester for my part of the assignment, among other things, I will change the following: Convert topic headings into questions. Reorder the table of contents. Compress certain sections that seem overly long/verbose. 

What strikes me most with this wiki is that much of it remains as two dimensional as any traditional hardbound paper text. This approach fails to take advantage of the multi dimensionality of web documentts with in-text links. The advantage of this approach would more empower the reader to get what they need most, when they need it,  and without the traditional constraints of a hardbound text's ROM format. On the other hand, if a section is too generalized, web links could provide additional information.</text>

	Before reading this tutorial, one should introduce themself to the ((http://wiki.mojavi.org:81/159.html)(Global Templating Tutorial)).

Decorator profiling is a simple idea: Separate your different arrangements of Decorator template, and populators, into scripts that make those calls automatically. 
	Decorator profiling is a simple idea: Separate your different arrangements of Decorator template, and populators, into scripts that make those calls automatically. To begin, let us take a look, evolutionarily, how one might separate the different display modes, or profiles, from the actual views.

++ Stage 1: Hardcode

In this example, a simple example of direct decoration of templates, does it's job. But it fails to provide a simple means for replicating this pattern of decorator/slot population in other Views without a copy/paste.

=Example 1: Hardcoded decorator information=

&lt;code&gt;

class IndexSuccessView extends PHPView
{

public function execute ()
{

// set our template
$this-&gt;setTemplate('IndexSuccess.php');

//setup our decorator template
$this-&gt;setDecoratorDirectory(MO_TEMPLATE_DIR);
$this-&gt;setDecoratorTemplate('myGlobalTemplate.php');

//setup our slots
//(SlotName, Module, Action)
$this-&gt;setSlot('menu', 'Content', 'PopulateMenu');
$this-&gt;setSlot('css', 'Content', 'PopulateCss');

// set the title
$this-&gt;setAttribute('title', 'Default Action');

}

}

&lt;/code&gt;

++ Step 2: Include

The second stage of abstraction is to create a separate script (a separate php file) and directly include it into your Views - eliminating copied code.

=Example 2: Included decorator information=

&lt;code&gt;

class IndexSuccessView extends PHPView
{

public function execute ()
{

// set our template
$this-&gt;setTemplate('IndexSuccess.php');

// set the title
$this-&gt;setAttribute('title', 'Default Action');

//get our profile
require(MO_TEMPLATE_DIR . '/profiles/Default.profile.php');

}

}

&lt;/code&gt;

As you can see, all the decorator calls have been removed, and an include place in their stead. The include file is below:

=Example Profile: Default.profile.php=

&lt;code&gt;
&lt;?php

//setup our decorator template
$this-&gt;setDecoratorDirectory(MO_TEMPLATE_DIR);
$this-&gt;setDecoratorTemplate('myGlobalTemplate.php');

//setup our slots
$this-&gt;setSlot('menu', 'Content', 'PopulateMenu');
$this-&gt;setSlot('css', 'Content', 'PopulateCss');

?&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

++ Step 3: =setProfile()=

The last stage, or what I would propose, is to create a simple method that loads our profiles for us, and perhaps provides with a few other utility functions such as

&lt;code&gt;
hasProfile()
loadProfile() or setProfile()
&lt;/code&gt;

=Example 3: Included decorator information=

&lt;code&gt;

class IndexSuccessView extends PHPView
{

public function execute ()
{

// set our template
$this-&gt;setTemplate('IndexSuccess.php');

// set the title
$this-&gt;setAttribute('title', 'Default Action');

//get our profile
$this-&gt;setProfile('Default');

}

}

&lt;/code&gt;

++ The =setProfile()= Method

Don't be decieved, the =setProfile()= method and the include method are, in the end, equivalent. One requires one more function call than the other, but I believe that the simplicity of the =setProfile()= makes it superior, along with providing automatic detection of profiles, and automatically searching in the proper directories (The directories that would store profiles, I suppose, would be MO_TEMPLATE_DIR/templates/profiles/).

=Example 4: The setProfile() method=

&lt;code&gt;
Note: This function is untested and may contain errors.


public function setProfile($name, $module = null)
{

//is the module null?
if($module === null)
{

//set the directory to the global profile directory
$dir = MO_TEMPLATE_DIR . '/profiles';

}
else
{

//set the directory to the module profile directory
$dir = MO_MODULE_DIR . '/' . $module . '/templates/profiles';

}

//setup the profile path
$profile = $dir . '/' . $name . '.profile.php';

//can we read it?
if(is_readable($profile))
{

//get the file
require($profile);

//set the profile up
$this-&gt;profile = $name;
return true;

}
else
{

//profile failed, set null
$this-&gt;profile = null;
return false;

}

}

&lt;/code&gt;

The member variable =$profile= will allow for a check to be run during View's preRenderCheck()

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== A brief overview ===

A little back ground is necessary to understand how to put a security system together. First there is the User class. It represents a visitor on a website Click here is for the User overview. You have SecurityUser classes that extend the User class. You can use this class to set and test the credentials of a visitor. In the Action class there is getCredential() method that is used by a SecurityFilter to compare the required credentials of an action to the credentials of a vistior. 

=== Credentials ===

Credentials can take on any form necessary to fit the needs of a particular website. It could be as simple as having only defined VISITOR and ADMIN creditials or a full blown CMS with users, roles and groups. A credential can be any legal php data type. This means it could be a STRING, an INTEGER, an ARRAY or an OBJECT. Figuring out the specifics of your credential is part of the planning you need to do for the specific site. I will show you both extremes.

The first step in using the security system is to authenticate the visitor. This is usally done through a login form that looks in a database to find a visitor to see if they have registered and have permission to be authenticated in the system. The next step is to set the credentials for the visitor. This can also be loaded from a database. This has your visitor ready to use the website to the fullest potential.

Each action, should be set with the allowed credentials for that action. You can also set up an action to not need any checking for credentials using the isSecure() method.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The User is an object to represent a visitor in a website using the Mojavi system. Each unqiue visit to the website is represented by a separate instance of the User class and that object is persistant for the life of that visitor's session. This is a great advantange in the Mojavi system in that you can maintain information pertaining to that session in an organized and logical way.

The User object is special in that is uses a Storage object to obtain data persistence. Because of this, you can store data specific to that visitor. You can do this by making a call to the User method setAttribute() and store the data there. This could be information about the user, such as their name, address or occupation. Or it would be information specific to that session, such as storing data from a multipage form. At any point during that visitor's session you can retrieve that same data by calling getAttribute(). 

The User can also be used to set up security for the website. Using a SecurityUser class, you can check the credentials of a visitor to see if they have permissions to be in restricted sections of the website.

In the User class you also have parameters that you can set to initialize custom implementations of the User class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Prerequisites ==

You should have a decent grasp of Mojavi2 and PHP5 before trying to upgrade to Mojavi3.

If you want a quick crash course of Mojavi 3, see Creating Your First Module.

== First Things First ==

Before you begin transferring your applications over from Mojavi2, make sure whatever host you're using supports PHP5. You can figure out if your host supports PHP5 by running 

 phpinfo();

Furthermore, you need to download and install the Mojavi3 package, which can be attained by going to this location.

== The Context ==

Probably the most important new and powerful aspect of Mojavi3 is the Context object. Once I figured out what this thing did, I fell in love with it. Basically, it is a sort of catalyst/storage object that allows you to access:
* The $request object via getRequest()
* The $controller object via getController()
* The $user object via getUser()
* The Current Action/Module names via getModuleName() and getActionName()
* And finally the Current module's directory

More or less, most classes that are exposed to the user/developer (you) are going to have a getContext() function, which will allow you to access this object. And with the recent addition of cascading calls, you can perform operations that you were unable to in php4, for example:

The Old Way:

 $obj        =&amp; $request-&gt;getAttribute('myobj');
 $anotherobj =&amp; $obj-&gt;doSomethingSpecial();
 $anotherobj -&gt; execute();

The New Way:

 $this-&gt;getContext()-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;getAttribute('myobj')-&gt;doSomethingSpecial()-&gt;execute();

Okay, so maybe that wasn't the best example, as it is rather lengthy, but you get my point, 1 line vs 3 lines, and no possible mistakes when dealing with large objects like copying them over without references, etc.

This subsection is to be continued....

== Translating your Renderer ==

Mojavi2 used 'renderers' to translate the API of one templating system into a generic API that would easily allow a developer to switch out one templating system for another. For example, the Smarty templating engine uses $smarty-&gt;assign() to allow you to set a variable, while patTemplate, another templating system, uses $pat-&gt;addVar(). In Mojavi 2, you would then write or use an existing renderer, which you would then invoke to display your output.

Note: This was done typically through a filter, which would create the renderer object, then assign it to your $request via

 $request-&gt;setAttribute('MyRenderer',$rendererObj))

Mojavi3 uses largely the same methodology, but instead of getting the renderer directly from the $request object within each of your views, it simply extends the View class.

For example:


 abstract class SmartyView extends View
 {
 .....
 
 function __construct()
 {
    $this-&gt;engine = $this-&gt;getContext()-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;getAttribute('MySmartyObj');
 }
, $value)
 {
    $this-&gt;engine-&gt;assign($name, $value);
 }
 
 .....
 }

Note: the use of

 $this-&gt;engine = $this-&gt;getContext()-&gt;getRequest()-&gt;getAttribute('MySmartyObj');

was simply the best solution I could come up with for getting any object from within the view, you could also have done the following just as easily:

 $this-&gt;engine = new Smarty();

== View ==

The Mojavi3 View is mostly an abstract class, which provides a skeleton of functions to work with, thus providing the unified API as was achieved in Mojavi2 (It's unified because you are forced to comply with the naming conventions implemented by the abstract class View.)

Now, instead of intitializing your Renderer object (as you would in Mojavi2) you simply extend View, and initialize that. Like shown above:

 abstract class SmartyView extends View
 {
 ...

is what our new View would look like. To put this new View type into action, we extend it when declaring views for our modules. For example:

 class DoSomeActionSuccessView extends SmartyView
 {
 ...
 }

As you can see, this is much more fluid than pulling the renderer out of $request with every new View, it's also a lot less code that you have to copy and paste, and thus less code to maintain. You may also have noticed that the naming scheme is different for the Views, instead of naming the file DoSomeActionView_success.class.php you would now name it DoSomeActionSuccessView.class.php, and name the class likewise(In Mojavi2 we just named our view classes DoSomeActionView, in Mojavi3 it's DoSomeActionSuccessView replacing 'Success' with your application's state).

This subsection is to be continued....

== Actions ==

Actions in Mojavi3 are fairly similiar to those of Mojavi2, with a few enhancement and semantic tweaks here and there. Listed Below:
* When returning a VIEW_SUCCESS in Mojavi2, now return the View class constant corresponding to your application state, ie: View::Success, or View::Error
* When checking for view types supporting execution (getRequestMethods) instead of returning REQ_POST etc, return Request::Post etc.
* There is a new return type for getRequestMethods(), Request::All, which serves all request methods.
* The root Action class which all your actions extend now has a getContext() method, which allows you access to the context object.

== Configuration ==

Mojavi3 configurations are done, by default, using .ini files. This simple and straightforward configuration makes configuring mojavi very easy. The base syntax of these ini files is as follows:

 [SECTION]
 
     ; a comment.....
     ConfigKey           = &quot;%MO_APP_DIR%/my/config/value&quot;

Because some people might not like ini files, Mojavi3 was created in such a way that you could write your own configuration handlers. For example, if you wanted to use xml files to configure your mojavi, you could write a configuration handler, plug it in, and start using your custom configuration styles.

This subsection is to be continued....

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Ever since Mojavi 3 was released earlier this year, people have been looking to create a flexible global templating solution. From using post filters to page controllers, people have been looking for a way to create simple and manageable global templates that will allow for a great deal of flexibility without compromising the need for larges amount of duplicated code.

++ Enter Decorator

The Decorator design pattern, like every other pattern, is nothing more than a way to talk about a resuable concept, or pattern, that a programmer might encounter while coding applications. The Decorator pattern's strength is it's ability to serve as a wrapper for that particular object, while leaving objects like it in tact.

The Decorator pattern has been implemented in the =View= class, providing a number of new methods:

&lt;code&gt;
public function setSlot ($attributeName, $moduleName, $actionName)
public function setDecoratorDirectory ($directory)
public function isDecorator ()
protected function &amp; getSlots ()
public function getDecoratorTemplate ()
public function getDecoratorDirectory ()
protected function &amp; decorate (&amp;$content)
&lt;/code&gt;

Now a brief explanation of what each of these do:

* =setSlot= - Creates a slot entry based upon the results of a specially controlled controller-&gt;forward()
* =setDecoratorTemplate= - Sets the template that you're going to use for your decorator. This method also automatically turns the decorator switch to =true=
* =isDecorator= - returns true is setDecoratorTemplate has been called, otherwise false.
* =getSlots= - Returns an array of the slots.
* =getDecoratorTemplate= - Returns the decorator template.
* =getDecoratorDirectory= - Returns the decorator directory.
* =decorate= - A method that must be implemented in derivate Views.
Note: these functions are in View, so all derivates of View (i.e. PHPView) have access.

++ Insert Here: Slots

Slots is a new name for an old concept. More or less, slots serve as placeholders that can be populated by the results of a =$controller-&gt;forward($mod, $act)= call. And, as you can see, the =setSlot= method takes three parameters:

&lt;code&gt;
public function setSlot ($attributeName, $moduleName, $actionName)
&lt;/code&gt;

The first parameter, $attributeName, serves as the name of the slot. The next two parameters will be used to get the results of that Action, put it in a buffer, and place it into the internal =$slots= member variable.

++ Let's Decorate!

The usage pattern of Views changes little with the implementation of the decorator pattern at the module level (though secondary View authors, i.e. SmartyView ''et al.'', do have a few things to play with).

Now let's look at what you're going to need to do implement the new, and NEW decorator features of Mojavi.

+++ Creating a Global Template

First off, we're going to need a great big christma..ehh..template to decorate. While I won't get into breaking down and factoring our global template, keep in mind that this is not the only way to do this.
=Example 2: The Christmas Tree (myGlobalTemplate.php)=
&lt;code&gt;
Side note: Sometimes you'll have issues with that &lt;?xml [....] ?&gt; declaration, an easy
workaround is to disable short tags in your php.ini file, or to use ini_set() to disable
it.
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en-us&quot;&gt;

&lt;head&gt;

&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php echo $template['title']; ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;application/xhtml+xml; charset=utf-8&quot;/&gt;
&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot; media=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

&lt;!--Css slot--&gt;
&lt;?php echo $template['css']; ?&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

&lt;!--menu slot--&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;menu&quot;&gt;

&lt;?php echo $template['menu']; ?&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!--main content slot--&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&gt;

&lt;?php echo $template['content']; ?&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;

+++ Putting the ornaments up
So now that we have our decorator template, we need to decorate it. The decorating process is fairly simple, and consists of the following simple steps:
* Setting the decorator directory using =setDecoratorDirectory()= (Optional)
* Setting the decorator template using =setDecoratorTemplate()=
* Setting slots =setSlot()=

For example,
=Example 3: In the View (IndexSuccessView.class.php)=
&lt;code&gt;

class IndexSuccessView extends PHPView
{

public function execute ()
{

// set our template
$this-&gt;setTemplate('IndexSuccess.php');

//setup our decorator template
$this-&gt;setDecoratorDirectory(MO_TEMPLATE_DIR);
$this-&gt;setDecoratorTemplate('myGlobalTemplate.php');

//setup our slots
//(SlotName, Module, Action)
$this-&gt;setSlot('menu', 'Content', 'PopulateMenu');
$this-&gt;setSlot('css', 'Content', 'PopulateCss');
// set the title
$this-&gt;setAttribute('title', 'Default Action');

}

}

&lt;/code&gt;

Now you might be wondering where the =content= slot is being populated. Well, =content= is a reserved slot that is automatically populated with the output of the originally requested Action/View pair.

Great idea - however - you jump right in without giving newcomers any context.  A new section needs to be added at the top, telling us exactly what buttons to press and options to choose to get our first program running.  A &quot;Hello World&quot; example, in other words :-)

==Recipes Wanted==
Good start.  Of course the information I want isn't there :-)  Would it be worthwhile adding a list of recipes wanted here?  Well I'll add one anyway; formatted as a definition list.  Anyone who has a better idea is, of course, free to fix it.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:08, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

;Resize Range: I need a routine that will resize a range by inserting or deleting rows as necessary.  I have a template sheet that includes named ranges. I need to resize them, moving all the rows that are below up or down as necessary. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:08, 26 September 2005 (UTC)

== Protect/unprotect; if certain cells un empty or null ==

---Excellent work!---
I need to protect certain cells depending on a condition. Input is allowed in either column G9,H9,I9,J9,K9 and rest all cell must be protect . For example if user has input in G9 column then H9,I9,J9,K9 must be protect; same is with rest columns.  Any single column  used for input. How can i achieve this task.

== Comparing values in 2 columns in excel ==

I would like to write (or insert) a program what will sequentially compare a value in cell b1 to all cells in column A.  I want this to repeat for the value in b2, and so on until all values in column B have been compared to all values in column A.  If a value in column b=value in column a, then I want the program to return a &quot;1&quot; in that row of column C. 
How do I do this?

== LibreOffice ==

Suggest create a &quot;translation&quot; to the free suite [[LibreOffice]]. --[[User:Diamondland|Diamondland]] ([[User talk:Diamondland|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Diamondland|contribs]]) 08:27, 12 June 2012 (UTC)

== Book name ==

I have renamed the book from Microsoft Excel Programming Recipes to Excel VBA. The book was only about VBA; for C++, there were just two links and no other info. &quot;Microsoft&quot; is unneeded in the book name. &quot;Recipes&quot; was okay but not strictly needed; removing it makes the book title nicely short and focused. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 07:25, 13 July 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm &quot;umming&quot; and &quot;erring&quot; a bit about this section.  I'm happy with the way the table of cameras links to the table of contents, although using anchors would be nice.  I'm thinking about setting up links from the table of cameras to separate pages for each camera.

To do:
* Anchors
* Investigate automated ways to duplicate the info from the table of cameras to the camera pages

      <text xml:space="preserve">(I have trouble understanding this information.  Is Limestone carbon dioxide?  If so, would the following arrangement of words better convey the information?)

* Limestone is one form of carbon sink as it consists largly of carbon dioxide and calcium.  Limestone is generated as the ocean organisms generated their microscopic shells, which eventually collect on the ocean bottom and are pressed into the rock-like substance.  

(If the foregoing is true, then some explanation is needed here as to how removal of carbon dioxide and calcium from sea water causes the following to occur.  Does more carbon dioxide content require more calcium content?  Does less oxygen content require more calcium?) 

As the ocean get more carbon dioxide mixed in it, rather than oxygen, then it tends to re-dissolve the limestone back into carbon dioxide and dissolved calcium.

* Soil humus and peat is another form of carbon sink.  Though it has been noted that in some types of warmer climate conditions soil humus is broken down faster than it forms.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Cases ==

Croatian language has 7 cases: nominativ, genitiv, dativ, akuzativ, vokativ, lokativ, instrumental.

e.g. ''mačka'' (cat)

Nominative: mačka 

Genitive : mačke

Dativ : mački

Akuzativ : mačku

Vokativ : mačko

Lokativ : (o) mački

Instrumental : (s) mačkom


==== More About Cases ====

'''Nominative''': The subject of a clause is in the nominative. 

'''Genitive''': The genitive expresses possession. This case is also used after certain prepositions. 

'''Dative''': Indirect objects take the dative. The dative is also used in certain other expressions. 

'''Accusative''': The direct object of a clause is put into the accusative. Also, the objects 
of certain prepositions take the accusative. Verbs of motion take the accusative. 

'''Vocative''': The vocative is sometimes used when addressing people directly. 

'''Locative''': The locative indicates location, and is used to describe position with such prepositions as na and u. 

'''Instrumental''': The instrumental is used with prepostions s (with).

During [[Rueda de Casino/Para el Medio|Para el Medio]], you start to 'scoop' with your left arm as you go
into the middle, and lift your arm over your head as you come out.

A variant is [[Rueda de Casino/El Pozo Con Ducha|El Pozo Con Ducha]] (The well, with a shower), where the hand that comes over your head wriggles to emulate a shower.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is aimed at those who want to improve their numeracy and arithmetic skills. It presents a wide range of techniques to simplify numerical calculations (to the point where many can be performed mentally without writing down any working). As well as describing these techniques, this book promotes a different way of approaching arithmetic problems than the traditional one taught in most schools. Specifically, the book promotes the idea that it is better to learn a wide range of techniques to solve a problem, (each technique optimised for a particular problem type), rather than learn just one general purpose technique to solve all problems in a particular class. Learning multiple techniques may initially seem like more work, but it will be seen that most of these techniques are very simple, making many seemingly difficult problems much easier to solve (by taking advantage of specific properties that are not present in the general case). Perhaps even more important than the more efficient arithmetic techniques is the deeper understanding gained by being aware of multiple approaches to the solution of any particular problem.

----&lt;br /&gt;

Welcome to the wonderful world of &quot;Vedic&quot; mathematics, a science that its founder claims was lost due to the advent of modern mathematics. Vedic mathematics is said by its founder to be a gift given to this world by the ancient sages of India, though there is no historical evidence whatsoever for this claim. It is a system for limited arithmetic and polynomial calculation which is simpler and more enjoyable than the equivalent algorithms of modern mathematics. 

'''Vedic Mathematics''' is the name given to a supposedly ancient system of calculation which was &quot;rediscovered&quot; from the Vedas between 1911 and 1918 by Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji Maharaj (1884-1960). According to Tirthaji, all of Vedic mathematics is based on sixteen Sutras, or word-formulae. For example, &quot;Vertically and Crosswise&quot; is one of these Sutras. These formulae are intended to describe the way the mind naturally works, and are therefore supposed to be a great help in directing the student to the appropriate method of solution. None of these sutras has ever been found in Vedic literature, nor are its methods consistent with known mathematical knowledge from the Vedic era.

Perhaps the most striking feature of the Tirthaji system is its coherence. The whole system is interrelated and unified: the general multiplication method, for example, is easily reversed to allow one-line divisions, and the simple squaring method can be reversed to give one-line square roots. And, these are all easily understood. This unifying quality is very satisfying, it makes arithmetic easy and enjoyable, and it encourages innovation.

Difficult arithmetic problems and huge sums can often be solved immediately by Tirthaji's methods. These striking and beautiful methods are a part of a system of arithmetic which Tirthaji claims to be far more methodical than the modern system. &quot;Vedic&quot; Mathematics is said to manifest the coherent and unified structure of arithmetic, and its methods are complementary, direct and easy.

The simplicity of the Tirthaji system means that calculations can be carried out mentally, though the methods can also be written down. There are many advantages in using a flexible, mental system. Pupils can invent their own methods; they are not limited to one method. This leads to more creative, interested and intelligent pupils.

Interest in the Tirthaji's system is growing in education, where mathematics teachers are looking for something better and finding the Vedic system is the answer. Research is being carried out in many areas including the effects learning the Tirthaji system has on children; developing new, powerful but easy applications of these Sutras in arithmetic and algebra.

The real beauty and effectiveness of the Tirthaji system cannot be fully appreciated without practising the system. One can then see why its enthusiasts claim that it is the most refined and efficient calculating system known.

&quot;Vedic Mathematics&quot; refers to a technique of calculation based on a set of 16 Sutras, or aphorisms, as algorithms and their upa-sutras or corollaries derived from these Sutras. Its enthusiasts advance the claim that any mathematical problem can be solved mentally with these sutras.&lt;br /&gt;

The old adage says practice makes perfect. That´s true of everything in life, so too for a student. Too often it happens that we study hard for some time, attain a peak level of mastery and feel we have attained it once and for all. Then we stop practicing confident that we have it. Sadly that´s not true for anything. Things have a tendency of slipping away if you don't practice. So practice, revise in case of changes in theory. Keep solving repeatedly in case of problems.

Once we have practiced something a sufficient number of times, it seems that our bodies remember the correct responses much better than our minds do. This is what makes us able to, for example, drive a car and carry on a conversation at the same time.</text>

&lt;!-- ============ PLEASE EDIT BELOW ================== --&gt;

== What is the problem with Imamat or Successorship After the Last Prophet of God? ==

Hi there,
I saw that you have tagged this book for deletion, But I don't understand why you don't consider it as a NPOV. 
Of course there is some muslim-POV in it but it is assumed that muslims are going to read it not anyone who doesn't know what Islam is, right?

If you think it should be moved elsewhere then suggest me a place to move it.
I personally don't think that deletion of documents be a good Idea, instead correcting them may be better. Spoiling one's contributions is not a good idea.

Thanks,
I am looking forward for your comments.

I moved the book titled Imamat myself. I will work on it offline and put it there later, I have only left the subjects.

== Porn vandalism ==

Thanks for blocking him. Could you also revert the moves [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Slickfifty] ? Only a sysop can do this because the destination page has an history. Thanks. [[User:Guillom|guillom]] 09:34, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
:Someone came on IRC requesting help, I couldn't block but I have reverted what I could :) [[User:Guillom|guillom]] 09:36, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

== re:BOTM &amp; COTM ==

Done. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:09, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

== Image copyright problem with Image:MFSG-CH1-Galaxy-irreg.jpg ==

Derbeth,

Maybe you can help me out with this Go-NoGo decision. You see my ebook: Morphological Flows and Sustainable Growth is already up (www.mbscientific.com), under the banner Evolutionary Philosophy. It touches all manners of disciplines from physics to chemistry to biology,..

To make the subject matters intuitive I have used all manners of pictorials, and media in general. Therein is the problem. Most have been gathered from .gov and .edu resources. Though I have tried to get the copyright status from as many sources as I could, I have to admit I couldn't do it for them all to the amount of scpecifity that wikibooks apparently requires.

As far as I can tell all of these .gov, .edu images can come under the fairuse policy (I added the tag to this particular image). After all they are from scholarly, free articles on the net, explicitly writen for scholarly work. To be further on the safe side, I have added a hyperlink in the text preceding the image, referencing the net location of the original.

To be honest, I really don't think I can take it any further. To be expected to accertain the ownership of every single image to a particular individual and then get a certified licence.. whell I have to hire a team of researchers to do that?

So here is the go-nogo decision, can scholarly resources be used in wikibooks (while referenced) and be acceptable under the wiki-fairuse criteria?

--[[User:Mikebaharmast|Mikebaharmast]] 15:37, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

== Image Copyright ==

Well, then apparently there is an inherent contradiction in the logic of wikibook philosophy. On one hand it promotes an open educational platform, which inherenetly promotes past academic expressions of thought (referenced). Yet if that academic expression is rendered in an image then it is barred, unless licenced. So an academic expression in text is ok, but, image, media, not so much.

There is one way to remedy this. If the browser code the you use in wiki article presentation space could interpret:

&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.sobemike.com/mike.jpg&quot;&gt;

i.e. render a remote image or media, like any browser, or even the original mozilla code, then the problem is solved.

Till then wikibooks requires an image to be uploaded, thereby marked as open source, which may or may not be in conflict with the original intent of the image author (whatever that maybe in an academic setting.. how would you even find out, these images are bounced around and modified countless trimes as a rule).

So again the ultimate solution would be the rendering of remote media in the wiki presentation code.. just implement the existing mozilla code.

Is that doable?

== Vandalism ==
Thanks for the revert on my user page.--[[User:Az1568|Az1568]] 07:37, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[WB:RFA]] ==

I have nominated [[User:Swift]] for adminship. He currently only has 3 votes (myself, sbjohnny, and withinfocus). Since I nominated him, I don't think I should be the one to make the final decision, so I will leave that up to you. 

Also, I have nominated by bot for the bot flag, and currently have a small number of votes for that. When the time comes, could you decide on that one way or the other? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:26, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

==Could I ask you for a vote of support?==

One more thing to smooth out the transwiki process... [[Wikibooks:Request_for_enabling_special:import#Additional_request]]. We're asking that &quot;Transwiki:&quot; be given namespace status so we can import to it directly. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:03, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

== Religious Texts ==

Given the number of texts on the topic of religion that have appeared on [[WB:VFD]] lately, I think it might be wise of us to specifically define what kinds of writing on the topic are allowed, and what kinds of writing are not allowed. If you let me know specifically what your objections are on the subject, I could start writing a draft at [[Wikibooks:Religion texts]] (or something similar). I'm still of the opinion that some books on the topic can remain, so long as they don't violte NPOV (or they violate it as little as most other books do). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:55, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[User:HDBot]] ==

I've temporarily given this bot the bot flag. It is a bot that will tag all the unlicensed images (there are approximately 3000 of them, i think) as being unlicensed. In a few weeks (2 or 3, at the least), [[User:SBJohnny]], myself, and a few other people are going to move to delete all the untagged images that are older then September of this year. After this bot marks the images as untagged (which will neatly categorize them), we can block the bot, and have the flag removed (pending an RfA to keep the flag). I hope you don't mind. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:50, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== darklama ==

He's got full support now (even from Panic). Whiteknight nominated him, so would you mind doing the deed? We need him. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:21, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

== Email... ==

I just sent you an email containing the code for my bot, and a few explanations on how to use it. I sent it to the email address you provided for the textbook-l mailing list, so I hope that is the right one to use. I've been using these programs alot in the past few days, so I know they work correctly with no bad side effects. Let me know if you need any other information to me.

PS, I've been working on fixing up the code to make it more readable and presentable. I want to release the source code to the general public soonish, when I figure out what license to use, and how, precisely, i want to host it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:09, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

:I got your email, and I figured I would send you a reply on here so I don't tempt your spam filter. I have two versions of the regexp program: The one that I didn't send you addressed all your concerns, but it only allows the user to target a single page. It allows you to post a custom edit summary, preview the changes, and even save your regular expressions into standalone modules. I could send you that version if you would like. Generally, this program is intended only for users who are familiar with perl, so I haven't done much with syntax checking (although I could definately try to do something).
:Second, thank you for making any changes to improve the readability/portability of my code. I find that I get a little sloppy when I program on windows (i ignore case sensitivity, etc), and I don't currently have a linux box to play with. Again, thank you very much for all your help and comments. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:08, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

== CC-NC ==

I didn't realize noncommercial licenses were not allowed. I think that was the only template I created with that license. Is that mentioned in the [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|copyrights policy]]? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:21, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

== Simple book move ==

Hi Derbeth... I do watch that page, I just don't know how to help them (it seemed to be addressed to Robert). We don't have [[Special:Export]], and I'm not an admin on simple (they only have 2, in fact). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:09, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

:If it's working then I have no idea how it works... doesn't look anything like the import dialog. How would you designate a destination project? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:46, 12 November 2006 (UTC)

== Acetone peroxide synthesis ==

I have proposed the acetone peroxide synthesis for deletion. What do you think? [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 14:14, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== Bot flag ==

Thanks derbeth! I'll keep you posted if I make any big changes. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:29, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

== AWB ==
Hi Derbeth - I was going to put this on WK's page but I see he is away &amp; I'll feel happier when one of you knows.

Thought I should probably bring this to your attention.  I'm now making more use of [[w:WP:AWB]] and there is plenty of work ahead.  It is a powerful tool for cleanup, categorisation, re-cats plus typos etc.  It is not a bot but does have an &quot;auto&quot; option (I'm not and would not use that).  My concern is that on WP you have to be vetted to use it (min 500 main space edits to be considered), here so long as you have an account you can run it.  I do feel that there is a possibility for misuse by novices or vandals (it can do quite a bit [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;limit=250&amp;target=Herbythyme&amp;namespace=0] quickly).  As far as I am aware Az1568 and myself are the only users on Wikibooks currently.  You may not see it as an issue but I would prefer you to know now rather than ask later.

Hope you don't mind me bringing it to you Derbeth - let me know if you need any further info --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:07, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

== Username change ==

Hello.  I recently changed by name on the English Wikipedia to Karl Dickman.  I was wondering if you could do the same for me here (change my username from [[User:Ingoolemo]] to [[User:Karl Dickman]]).

::OK let's start this with &quot;I was very tired&quot;.  However when Johnny asked if I minded being checkusered, the answer was fine (&amp; I actually think doing it on any RfA is a good idea).  However I got no answer as to why and knew the above had been posted I really did feel that giving me the rights with the checkuser pending was inappropriate - I was too tired to do anything more rational - hopefully you will understand. 
::Add to that the fact that I had created the staff account (I've mailed the password to WK and you are welcome to it) and people started getting shirty about it because they hadn't read the rationale and again hopefully you will understand.

== IP block info ==
Hi Derbeth - sorry to bug you, some advice if/when you have a minute.  The IP I &quot;underblocked&quot; yesterday, I can't easily see where ''DNSstuff says it might be an &quot;exploitable server&quot;'' - am I missing something obvious (or doing the wrong search)?  While I'm at it am I &quot;safe&quot; using the default checked boxes on blocking? Be good to learn - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Hum - equally - how do I (can I) unblock?  There was a forum spam type one today, I checked contributions and there were none so I blocked for a day.  Then checked DNS stuff and found it was a Russian IP, using your logic of yesterday I decided at least a month was more appropriate but could see a way to unblock? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:30, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
:Thanks for the advice.  I am trying to think before I do things.  I did check WP on todays one and there was nothing there (even contribs).  I've changed it to 1 month based on the fact that it is (apparently) an ad bot from Russia [http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ip4r.ch?ip=81.195.11.107] - hadn't thought to use the spam test - sorry --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

Could I get your comments on the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism_in_progress#Another_mumfun|mumfum]] issue. Several user accounts have had similarities so it is likely that it is the same person. My understanding of check-user is that you can look up the IP addresses which these users have used. Is this correct? Can you also see if there are other users that come from that IP address? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 20:22, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:IRC channels]] ==

autoconfirmed mean (when I'm right) only registed user can move, but thats default on the Wikimedia servers.

I think it makes more sens when you change it to move=sysop.

Or is autoconfirmed her also &quot;against&quot; new users?

I don't know how this stuff is in the EN Wikis (many things are different, example you can Import, but where on DE.Wikibooks not), but better ask then again some thing like mumfuns moving vandalism ...

:The last thing is very nice :-)
:About autoconfirmed:
:I try it out ([http://de.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Spielwiese&amp;action=history])
:No, autoconfirmed allow normall users to move the page.

(x posted Whiteknight/Derbeth)

One of those &quot;you shouldn't assume things&quot;.  Each morning (to me) I deal with the day's mumfun but post it on ViP.  I reckon that is informing the community and that one of you folk will checkuser the latest one when you get on and take appropriate action?  Is this the case/worthwhile?

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

I notice you've tried to edit common.css and then reverted your changes because they didn't work. I may be able to help. Which skin are you using?

Ok I believe I've fixed it.

:Looks like I'm wrong. Its got something to do with the monobook skin though. I'll keep working at it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:37, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

:Ok what seems to be happening is printable just removes a few things from pages and skips javascript files, but continues to use the stylesheets for whatever skin a person has set. Since printable is still considered to be screen rather then print media there seems to be no way to effect the printable version without effecting how things look in general. Wikipedia has a similar issue from what I've seen. I think a bug report would be needed to fix this problem, such as suggesting that there should be something like MediaWiki:Printable.css that is used when printable=yes is true and not including any other stylesheets when that is the case. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:20, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

== Help! I'm new. Can this be a wikibook?  ==

Hi. I've been putting together a wiki-version of an academic art book called New Media Art, by Mark Tribe. Mark teaches an entire course based on the book at Brown University, and I know it is used in classes at other institutions. I started to put it up on wikibooks, since that seemed to be where it fit best (rather than wikipedia or wikiversity). You can see the content so far at: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/New_Media_Art. I was soon warned by two editors that it was not appropriate content -- that it was encyclopedic/macropedic and thus not a &quot;textbook.&quot; Though the content of the book is structured in an encyclopedic way (a series of sections, each on a particular artist or artist group), it can still be considered an art historical text. The introduction, for instance, gives a broad overview of the New Media art tradition and ties together the artists discussed in the rest of the book. I've already been told that the content I've put up so far will probably be deleted. Where does this book belong, if not in wikibooks? 

Your help is greatly appreciated! I'm new to the whole wiki communication thing, but I think you can leave me a comment on my &quot;talk&quot; page: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Lblissett

Thanks again.

#I should not have edited [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]]. Thank you for reverting my edit, I was away all weekend and could not do it myself.
#[[Wikibooks:Image use policy]] and [[Wikibooks:Fair use policy]] are both proposals, not policy. [[User:Iamunknown]] has moved my changed on the fair use policy to an unstable branch, but I do not intend to revert my changes to the image use page. 
Also, it is just as likely that you are misterpreting Kat's message as I am. I dont see any evidence in that post that the WMF is interested in keeping Fair Use materials on the projects, except in a very small number of exception cases. I don't think it's good form for you to be accusing me of misinterpretation, especially not until the WMF comes out with an official clarification on the matter. Assuming good faith means admitting that I might be right about this, just as you might be right. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:59, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks for your response. I'm sorry (again) for my haste. I think it's still a good idea for us to plan for the possibility that Fair Use will be severely limited or even banned completely. It can never hurt to plan. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:25, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

==Main page ==

I agree with your comments on the staff lounge. The change to the Main Page that has turned it into a Library Catalogue looks like a retrograde step. It needs an admin to change it to something more relevant (See [[Main Page/test]]) [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:46, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

== Your block ==

I notice you have blocked [[User:85.14.73.190]] for two years.  I can find no real trace of the IP on Wikipedia or Commons - I'd be interested to know where you found out about the vandalism.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 21:09, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

:I appreciate the information - it goes along the lines of some work I've been looking at recently which would be more consistent crosswiki blocks on real vandals.  So
:# Would you advise blocking that IP on Commons?
:# This one is not blocked with us - [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Vandalism_reports#User:66.240.221.36] - should it be?
:# Can I ask you to review your block on this one - [[User talk:72.177.68.38]] - indef now on WP &amp; Commons (the Wp page is entertaining and they have appealed on both Commons &amp; Books and been rejected).  I would consider indef appropriate?
:# Finally could I have your views on this one [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Vandalism_reports#User:71.234.9.178], blocked 1 month on Books and 3 months on Commons.  I am not asking you to change my block (I will do that) but I would appreciate your views (and probably on whether I should change the block on Commons?).

:My thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:40, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

::Advice appreciated.  I've blocked &quot;yours&quot; on Commons (&amp; I'm asking the blocking admin to review the other one there - if I get no response I'll do it myself).  I've re-blocked the one here as your suggestion.  Feel free to let me know of any other cross wiki ones (I do keep my eyes on that page on meta too). --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:23, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
::BTW amazing the fuss meta made about the CU request, I fail to see what the issue is with such a request over vandalism - if you need an extra voice anytime let me know --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:34, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

== Cross wiki vandals ==

Hi Derbeth - I seem to be seeing more of vandals who have now got serious blocks (&amp; records) on Wikipedia moving on to other wikis.  Not looking for policy here at all but are you happy that a &quot;record&quot; on WP can and should be taken into account in deciding the length of block or am I being a little harsh there?  To me they are &quot;blatant vandals&quot; who are well aware of what they were doing on another wiki and should be treated as though the record was a common one to other wiki's.  

It seems rather pointless to me, when someone is blocked for months on WP, to start with days, or even hours on here or on other wikis. Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:06, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

== Kudos ==

Some time back you pointed out that CU data really doesn't last long.  I paid attention!  2nd spammer (user) from 1 IP over a 6 week period found thanks to your comments - thanks and regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:34, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

== Greetings from a new user ;-) ==

Hi Derbeth, the en and pl versions of Wikibooks cross sometimes, like in the [http://pl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fa%C5%82szywi_przyjaciele_slawisty False friends] project, hence some confusion. Anyway, thanks for your notice. The English version of my welcome text is available now. All the best, [[User:Grzegorj|Grzegorj]] 13:47, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

I'm not the author, I'm creating the wikibook for the author. He gave me the content and I should do the rest.

== Boring maybe ==

But more kudos Derbeth.  I've started some crosswiki vandal work which seems worthwhile.  Picking up CU info, black lists, WP blocks and the like.  When I come to block the IPs here they are mostly already done by you!  If I can work out how to do it you should get on the CU list in a day or so &lt;g&gt;. Hope all is well, regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:22, 31 May 2007 (UTC)

== Asian Fan Dance 2  ==

Hi Derbeth,

I appreciate your correction.  As you can see by a review of my interactions with the wikibooks community, I am not a vandal.  Besides that, I am not exactly &quot;well-versed&quot; in copyright law.  However, this situation could serve as a very valuable learning experience for me to share with the students in the undergrad. course in which I serve as a grad. assistant -- the course whose [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education|primary textbook]] uses the Asian Fan Dance image as its cover.  

Could you tell me where I can find an explanation of the copyright laws that I could understand without a law degree?  In conversations with [[User:Whiteknight]] and [[User:SBJohnny]], they've made it clear that copyright violations are a huge problem for the wikibooks community.  If you could point me toward a source, I'd love to re-tool the pages that discuss this issue here in Wikibooks.  

Last, what (specifically) can I do to the Asian Fan Dance image to render it compliant with the pertinent copyright laws?  Once an image is uploaded, can one change the its copyright status?  How?

Thanks for your help, Derbeth.  I've seen your name all over this place and am proud to have communicated with you -- even under imperfect conditions.  :)

== Rename to Zachary ==

I would like to rename ZJH to [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AListusers&amp;username=Zachary&amp;group=&amp;limit=1 Zachary], to avoid confusion with having different account names (this is one of only two of my many non-bot accounts that don't share a common username, see [[m:User:Zachary]]).

:Just to clarify, you will need to first rename Zachary to something else to make way for a rename for my account. The account does pass the criteria for usurpation per Wikipedia's policy. [[User:ZJH|ZJH]] 07:18, 8 September 2007 (UTC)

== Another Upload ==

Hi Derbeth,

I have recently uploaded a modified image.  The original image is from the Wikimedia Commons, and the author released it into the public domain, unconditionally.  I added text to the original image for use as a wikibook cover.  A few months ago, you asked me to make sure that I use the same license as the original author.  The original author, [[User:Gorgo]] licensed the image as &quot;own work; public domain,&quot; so keeping this license required me to claim that the image was my own work.  

This is confusing, and I certainly don't want to abuse the wiki community, so I wonder if you could tell me whether or not I am ok this time.

Thanks for your help, and have a great day!

Sorry, I forgot to mention that the name of the newly uploaded image is &quot;Derived from Moraine Lake 17092005.JPG&quot;

== Usurpation Mania ==

I'm sending this message to all our current bureaucrats, [[User:SB Johnny]], [[User:Derbeth]], [[User:Withinfocus]] (and myself).

If you take a look at [[WB:AN]], you'll notice that we've been swamped with username usurpation requests because of SUL. This isn't even the half of it, [[User talk:Whiteknight|my user talk page]] as well as [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard's]] are being loaded with them as well. I've been handling the majority of them, I've seen [[User:Withinfocus]] handle a couple as well. This volume of requests is likely to stay steady at least, and may rise as more users find naming conflicts.

I'm thinking that we need a more organized way to do this, at least temporarily. en.wikipedia has a nice model to follow, they have a dedicated rename requests page (several, actually), and they use a series of templates to create a lot of links to help the bcrats out. [[w:WP:USURP]] is the page, I believe. I would like to create a discussion page ([[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance/Renames]] is an option) where all rename and usurpation requests can be directed. The page can contain some basic instructions about how to request a rename, and maybe a few basic rules about it. I know we don't have any &quot;official&quot; rules yet, but maybe it's something that we can think about doing. This is another page on your watchlist, and more procedure, but it would help to ease the work flow a little, I think.

[[User:Withinfocus]] and I have already had at least one disagreement about a rename (it was very minor), but maybe it's worth coming up with some guidelines as a group? If we have a few points of consistency, that might help to streamline things a little. 

Also, considering that bcrat-related activity is in a spike, and some of our current bcrats are less active here then they used to be, I think I would like to seriously field some new candidates for the position. If anybody has any comments or suggestions about this, I would love to hear them. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 05:30, 2 June 2008 (UTC)

: Thank you, and thank you for the explanation on my talk page. I personally think that the cover pages with a picture are of little use, and that the main page should better feature table of contents, just like it does with, say, [[LaTeX]] or [[Rhetoric and Composition]]. For a printed book, a cover makes sense, but I estimate that online books are mostly accessed in a reference manner, meaning that the readers have a specific question in mind to which they seek an answer; and for this use case, table of contents and index are of most use. Cover on the main page to the exclusion of index increases the click-distance to the useful content. That said, a kind of cover can be present alongside the TOC, as currently seen at [[Rhetoric and Composition]]. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 19:08, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

Can you show the original message from Flickr?

thanks for your quick response. how about this one? http://www.flickr.com/photos/crystalflickr/1618832555/
i got it from the category of Creative Commons Attribution License from Flickr. But there is no sign of Creative Commons License from the site of the photograph. Can I use it? And, can you give me some suggestions of where to find free images for the wikibook? i'm a new user. Many thanks!

You are so::: helpful, and efficient too!!! Oh, another thing. Could you delete all these images from the server so that nobody will use them by mistake? I will delete them from my wikibook. Thanks!

== JavaScript/Cover ==

[[Image:Wikibooks-javascript.png|right|250px]] I would really like to see the cover image with the ladybug removed from the TOC of [[JavaScript]]. The image has no bearing on JavaScript, and it contains the pretentious text &quot;A great book&quot;. That is intellectually dishonest; I've rarely ever seen anything of the sort in commercial publishing, if at all. Also, &quot;WikibookS&quot; is obviously a misspelling of the project name &quot;Wikibooks&quot;; &quot;Javascript&quot; is a misspelling too, so is &quot;WikimediA&quot;. And a book on JavaScript would need a portrait format, not a landscape one. I have explained that at the talk page of JavaScript.

My disagreement pertains to what I have stated above; the place where you placed the image is IMHO perfect, combining the quick availability of TOC with the presence of eye candy. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 13:34, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

&lt;noinclude&gt;
This is the Cuban version of the cross-body step.  It is pretty much the same,
but doesn't have to move through 180 degrees like the cross-body step does.
This move takes us from [[Rueda de Casino/Para el Medio|para el medio]] position into the Cuban basics, i.e.,
it makes the leaders face clockwise instead of anticlockwise.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

A [[w:chroma subsampling|full bandwidth (4:4:4)]] HD [[w:Serial Digital Interface|SDI]] camera with improved [[w:colorimetry|colorimetry]] and [[w:sensitometry|sensitometry]]-related specs and a [[w:Super 35|Super 35]]-sized recording area, thus making it compatible with regular Cine Primo lenses and 35 mm [[w:depth of field|depth of field]]. Unlike the 2/3&quot; 3-CCD RGB imaging system used in the CineAlta, the Genesis uses a single 12 megapixel CCD chip with the same width (but not the same height) as a standard 35mm film frame. The main imaging module of the Genesis is made by Sony, but the exact relationship between the two companies is unclear, since the abovementioned joint partnership was dissolved in 2004 with Panavision's re-purchase of the 8% shareholding Sony bought in 2000. 

The '''Genesis''' is [[Panavision]]'s high-end [[digital]] [[movie camera]], which uses a [[proprietary]], full frame [[35mm]]-width, 1.78 (16:9) [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], 12.4-megapixel [[RGB]] [[CCD]]. It is being used for the first time to shoot [[Bryan Singer]]'s ''[[Superman Returns]]'' and was shortly followed up by the [[British]] [[WWI]] film ''[[Flyboys]]''. However, the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-heavy nature of these two movies meant that ultimately the comedy ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'' was the first theatrically released feature sourced primarily from the Genesis camera. Genesis has since been used by cinematographer Dean Semler for shooting ''[[Click]]'' and ''[[Apocalypto]]''.


Unlike the 2/3&quot; 3-CCD RGB imaging system used in the CineAlta HD-900F (used in ''[[Attack of the Clones]]''), the Genesis uses a single 12.4 megapixel CCD chip with the same width (but not the same height) as a standard 35mm film frame. The CineAlta presented a number of unwelcome compromises, as the [[Holy_grail#Casual_metaphor|holy grail]] had always been to produce an electronic camera that could utilize Panavision's existing film-type lenses that their customers were already familiar with, producing similar on-screen images with an equivalent depth-of-field characteristic.  

Unfortunately, most [[lenses]] designed for [[film]] cameras cannot be adapted to work on 3-chip (or 3-tube) video cameras, because of the need to allow room for a [[dichroic]] color separation [[prism (optics)|prism]]. On a typical 2/3&quot; 3-CCD video camera the clearance between the [[rear lens element]] and the [[focal plane]] needs to be at least 50mm (2&quot;). Most cine lenses have far less clearance than this, as they have only ever needed to allow room for the [[shutter]], so on a video camera, the image will want to [[focus]] somewhere in the middle of the prism block. Panavision originally tried to overcome this problem with optical adaptors that fitted between the cine lens and the video camera but these have all produced an unacceptable drop in image quality.

Apart from this, there were a number of operational problems with both the lenses and cameras used for ''Attack of the Clones'', and so for ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]'', [[George Lucas]] severed his long-standing relationship with Panavision in [[2003]], obtaining newer-model Sony [[HD]] cameras and lenses from [[Plus8Digital]] instead, highlighting the perennial problem of rapid obsolescence of video formats. 

In an attempt to address these problems, Panavision followed this up in [[2004]] with the Genesis HD camera, a [[chroma subsampling|full bandwidth (4:4:4)]] [[Serial Digital Interface|HD SDI]] camera with improved [[colorimetry]] and [[sensitometry]]-related specs and a [[Super 35]]-sized recording area, thus making it focally compatible with regular Cine Primo lenses and giving a true 35 mm [[depth of field]].

Unlike the 2/3&quot; 3-CCD RGB imaging system used in the CineAlta, the Genesis uses a single 12 megapixel CCD chip (although it only actually outputs 6 Megapixels - 2M each of red, green and blue) with the same width (but not the same height) as a standard 35mm film frame. This is a significant breakthrough in that it allows just about any Panavision spherical 35mm cine lens to be used. However there are as yet unanswered questions about the resultant color quality, since single-chip [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] color cameras using the exact same color-stripe sampling technique have always performed poorly compared to equivalent 3-chip models. The main imaging module of the Genesis is made by [[Sony]], but the exact relationship between the two companies is unclear, since their joint partnership was dissolved in 2004 with Panavision's re-purchase of the 8% shareholding Sony bought in [[2000]]. 

In any event, there is still considerable skepticism in the film industry about the real value of [[digital cinematography]] for mainstream movie production, and as of yet, only a very small percentage of cinema-release projects have been shot digitally since Sony/Panavision introduced the CineAlta in [[1999]]. Only two true &quot;blockbuster&quot; movies have been shot digitally (as of October 2005): ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith''. Other notable but lesser-stature digitally captured features include: ''[[Collateral]]'' and ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (both by '[[Michael Mann]]'), ''[[Sin City]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' and the ''[[Spykids]]'' series. Significantly, none of the [[Columbia Pictures]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-heavy [[Marvel Comics]] films (''[[Spiderman]]'', ''[[X-Men]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[The Hulk]]'') were shot digitally, even though Columbia is owned by Sony.

There have also been numerous complaints about the small black and white viewfinders normally supplied with digital cameras, which are virtually useless for critical focus. The [[wikibooks:D-20 (Arri)|D-20]], [[Arri|Arri's]] answer to the Genesis, incorporates a [[reflex viewfinder|reflex optical viewfinder]] to address this concern.  The Genesis uses Sony's HDVF-C30W TFT color LCD viewfinder, which has a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think it needs to be pointed out that in the exponential decay, the fact that we will &quot;run out&quot; of rabbits or atoms is because they are discrete quantities, while the DE is a continuous model - the exponential function asymptotically approaches zero but will never equal it (well until you hit an infinite time), but you don't think about having fractions of rabbits or atoms when you find your exponential function equals, say, 0.5.

Good point.  I'll add something about this when I get a chance (maybe sometime in a day or 2), unless you want to go ahead and do it for me.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 19:51, 26 September 2005 (UTC)


Shouldn't the left hand side of the second integration be with respect to dt like the right side? x' is usually dx/dt? [[User:128.183.52.202|128.183.52.202]] 18:24, 21 June 2007 (UTC)
: Yes it should have been, too bad this comment went unnoticed for so long. Thanks though, the change did get made. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:55, 19 October 2010 (UTC)</text>

After pushing hands together in the Cuban basic, the leaders turn to their right
and reach for the next partner, then on the first beat they start a [[Rueda de Casino/Dile Que No|dile que no]], and then
continue with Cuban basics (or anything else the caller shouts).

 Note: There are some other names for this command:
 
 [[Rueda de Casino/Dame Una|Dame Una]]
 [[Rueda de Casino/Dame Otra|Dame Otra]]
 [[Rueda de Casino/No Me Gusta|No Me Gusta]]

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
