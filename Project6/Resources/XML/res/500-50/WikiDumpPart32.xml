Windows is the most widely used OS for home and business desktop use, and thus is well supported by software developers. Early versions of Windows were based on Microsoft's DOS (Disk Operating System), and were therefore not designed with persistent network connections in mind (unlike UNIX; see below).  This posed a problem for Windows' growth because as persistent network connections have become more commonplace, so have the risks of viruses, malware and other security breaches.  A major redesign that began with Windows NT aims to address this.

===Windows 1, Windows 2, Windows 3, Windows 3.1, Windows 3.11, Windows 3.12 ===
These early versions of Windows were based (concurrently with Apple's) on the XEROX PARC concept of WIMPS (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointing System) and were little more than a pretty Graphical User Interface on top of MSDOS. In fact, versions in the 1.x and 2.x families had as their main shell a text-based directory listing, and their programs do not work on newer versions of Windows. The early versions were not popular: most users stayed with DOS until Windows 3.1 came along with rather simple networking support.  Novell and others exploited the opportunity that Microsoft had left, but they failed to recognise the emerging Internet Standard, ''TCP/IP''. This critical error allowed Microsoft to regain control, albeit with little concern at the time for complete and secure implementations.

=== Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, Windows Me === 
Windows 95 introduced pre-emptive multitasking to the consumer Windows family.  This was very important at the time, as Windows had gained (with hindsight, unfairly) a reputation for being unstable; in reality, however, the large majority of the errors were in the applications and third-party drivers that Windows ran.  Pre-emptive multitasking allowed for an application to fail without bringing down the whole machine.  Nevertheless, these versions of Windows still lacked adequate housekeeping, such that a failing application could leave the memory in such a mess that a reboot was needed.  In practice, however, most people using commercial applications saw relatively few crashes.  Three fundamental problems remained: 
* there was no hard wall preventing a user application to run at kernel level; 
* there was nothing to distinguish data memory from instruction memory; and
* there was no concept of Administrator or Super-user; ordinary users had full control but lacked the knowledge to manage it.  The system was delivered with critical TCP/IP functions exposed.
All of these made the world's most popular operating system a sitting duck for malware authors. However, as Windows became more popular as a malware target, some other OS's seem to have lagged in security as well since they are very rarely targeted.

===Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003 ===  
The availability of 32-bit memory addressing allowed Microsoft to redevelop large parts of the OS to meet the standards needed to drive on the &quot;Information Superhighway&quot;.  Top software designers were headhunted from Digital Equipment Corporation to redesign the OS from the ground up. They designed and developed Windows NT (&quot;New Technology&quot;), discarding much of the DOS framework.  Windows NT is, by design, more secure than previous versions of Windows.  Microsoft eventually phased out all DOS-based versions of Windows in favor of the NT-based varieties.  Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003, and Windows Vista are all based on Windows NT architecture.

* As an interesting sidenote, Windows NT (WNT) was marketed as &quot;Windows New Technology&quot;, and was often guessed by users to be &quot;Windows Networking Technology&quot; because networking was made native to Windows NT.  It has later been disclosed, however, that WNT was actually a play on VMS (another operating system) - in the same manner as 2001: A Space Odyssey's HAL was supposedly a play on IBM.

In designing the Windows operating systems, Microsoft had decided that user friendliness was the main goal of the design.  As a side effect, Windows systems generally did not have adequate security settings enabled by default, even in NT-based versions until the release of Windows XP SP2 and Windows Vista, and therefore could still be compromised if connected &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; to the Internet directly.  In fact, many users have complained that their computers became infected with various worms and viruses even while installing Windows XP.  However, since the release of Windows Vista - the first Microsoft operating system to be developed using the Trust Computing Development Lifecycle, these problems have largely become irrelevant. Windows includes software for sharing an Internet connection between Windows computers connected on the same network, as well as rudimentary firewall software for protecting the network. Since Windows Vista, Microsoft ships an anti-spyware solution built-in and a free anti-virus solution called Microsoft Security Essentials is currently in beta, with plans to be made available for free to all users of Genuine Windows. For even better security (usually recommended for home or small business networks), a separate hardware-based switch with an integrated firewall is a wiser solution. Such hardware can be purchased for as little as $30 US. (This security measure can, in fact, be used with any operating system, not just Windows.)

A 2008 study comparing the source code quality of Linux, the Windows Research Kernel (a derivative of the Windows 2003 Kernel), FreeBSD and Solaris found that the quality of code was roughly equivalent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spinellis.gr/pubs/conf/2008-ICSE-4kernel/html/Spi08b.pdf 2008 source code quality study]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ReactOS ==
ReactOS is a project attempting to create a Windows compatible open-source operating system. It uses no code from Microsoft Windows and is completely open-source. It also is not based on Linux, however some code is carried over from the Wine project which runs on Linux. Currently it is in alpha stage and not suitable for production systems.

== Overview ==

'''''Hedwig''''' is Harry's pet owl. Since mail is delivered by owls in the wizarding world, she plays a valuable role in Harry's life. More than that, however, she is one of Harry's companions; sometimes Harry feels that Hedwig is the only friend he has left.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is allowed to bring a toad ''or'' a cat ''or'' an owl to school, according to the book-list. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who is guiding him through [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], decides to buy Harry an animal as a birthday present. Toads, he says, are old-fashioned and would get him laughed at, and he doesn't like cats, so he takes Harry to Eeylops Owl Emporium and buys him a snowy owl. Back at the Dursleys' home, Harry decides to name his owl Hedwig, a name he had found in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]] text.

At King's Cross Station, as he tries to find [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Platform 9 and Three Quarters|Platform Nine and Three Quarters]], Harry feels that Hedwig's cage on top of his luggage cart makes him seem out of place. When he sees another family walking past, talking about Muggles, he begins to hope they might be able to show him the way to the platform, but he only dares approach them when he sees one of them also has an owl in a cage. We will later learn that this is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Weasley Family|Weasley family]], and the owl in question is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermes|Hermes]], who belongs to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]].

During the first week of school, Hedwig occasionally flies in with the post owls at breakfast, to nibble affectionately at Harry's ear and get a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the Owlery. On Friday, she brings a note from Hagrid, inviting Harry to tea after class. Harry immediately sends a response back saying he'd be glad to.

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] plan to get [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] to take Hagrid's pet dragon, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Norbert|Norbert]], to Romania to release it back into the wild, it is Hedwig who brings Charlie's response back to the Trio. From this we can assume that it was Hedwig who carried the request to Charlie.

In the chamber with the logic puzzle, Harry instructs Hermione to return to the Owlery and send Hedwig with a message for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]. It turns out that Hermione never gets that far, meeting with Dumbledore in the Entrance Hall.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] doesn't want strange things happening at his house, he refuses to let Hedwig hunt; he has locked her into her cage. Harry is locked into his room after the disastrous visit of the Masons on the evening of his birthday. We see Harry giving Hedwig most of his vegetable soup, and see her disapproval. When the Weasleys arrive to rescue harry, he nearly forgets Hedwig; her loud hoots at being nearly abandoned wake Vernon up, and he charges into Harry's room just too late to catch Harry.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

After the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] attack at Little Whinging, Harry writes letters to Sirius Black, Ron, and Hermione, demanding an explanation. Hedwig is out hunting; when she returns with a frog she has caught, Harry immediately sends her away with the letters, and instructions to peck at the recipients until they have written good long letters to send back to him. She leaves straight away, still clutching her frog, and Harry regrets having sent her away, as she is the only sympathetic person at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|4 Privet Drive]]. He expects her prompt return, but she does not reappear.

Hedwig flies down from her perch on top of a wardrobe and lands on Harry's shoulder when Harry arrives at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], where she had stayed after delivering the messages Harry had given her. Harry is very glad to see her, and keeps stroking her even while speaking angrily to Ron and Hermione, who both show signs of Hedwig having pecked them. When Harry gets too angry, Hedwig retreats, reproachfully, to the top of the wardrobe.

After the meeting that evening, Hedwig and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]] are clattering around on top of the wardrobe. Ron throws some Owl Treats up there for them, explaining that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] doesn't want them out hunting too often, it would raise questions.

On the last day before the start of classes, Harry climbs on a chair to clean all the owl droppings off the top of the wardrobe. Finishing, he tosses the accumulated owl droppings into a wastebasket, which swallows them and belches loudly. During the conversation that follows, the wastebasket occasionally makes soft gagging noises as it coughs up the owl droppings. Hermione borrows Hedwig at this point to send her parents the news that she has been made a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]].

Hedwig returns just before everyone leaves for the Hogwarts Express, and obligingly flutters off Hermione's shoulder and over to her cage as Harry finishes packing. At an angry call from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] downstairs, Harry stuffs her unceremoniously in her cage and carries her and his trunk downstairs. 

Harry travels to King's Cross Station with a number of members of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order]], and does not see Hedwig again until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], in porter's uniform, brings her and all the luggage to Platform Nine and Three Quarters.

Once on the Hogwarts Express, Hedwig stays in the compartment with Harry, and is disturbed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]]'s screams of laughter when Ron jokes about the lines he plans to give to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregory Goyle|Goyle]].

When Harry's scar pains him at the end of his fourth detention with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]], Harry writes a coded letter to Sirius to ask for advice. He carefully tells Hedwig that although the letter is addressed to Snuffles, it is really for Sirius. Hedwig blinks, which Harry takes to be understanding, and flies off from the Owlery.

The day after the initial meeting of what becomes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], a bedraggled Hedwig appears at the window of Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]] class. Harry lets her in, then, finding her injured, asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Binns|Professor Binns]] for permission to go to the Hospital Wing as he doesn't feel well. Getting grudging permission, he instead goes to the staff room, where he finds [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. Hearing that Harry has an injured owl, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]] also comes to the door, and she in turn takes Hedwig, saying she'll get Hedwig all fixed up. McGonagall reminds Harry of the message on Hedwig's leg, then quietly warns him that all communications in and out of the school are monitored. Hedwig, meanwhile, seems to feel that Harry is abandoning her. 

The message on Hedwig's leg proves to be from Sirius, and reads simply ''&quot;Tonight, same time, same place.&quot;'' When Sirius is nearly caught in the Gryffindor common-room fire by Umbridge, Hermione guesses that it was on Umbridge's order that Hedwig had been intercepted.

Hedwig, with her injuries healed, is brought back to the Gryffindor common room and returned to Harry by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]. It is then that Dobby tells Harry how to find the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]].

Hedwig and Pigwidgeon are then not seen again until the trip back to London on the Hogwarts Express. It is noted that Hedwig and Pigwidgeon are disturbed by Ron's outburst when he learns that Ginny is going out with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Hedwig, when we first see her, is sulking, either asleep or pretending. Harry knows that it is because she has been allowed so little time outside her cage in the past short while. When Harry pushes a couple of owl nuts through the cage bars to her, she ignores them. She remains unmoving while Harry, possibly in jest, shows her the places around the house at Privet Drive that hold memories for him.

Climbing into the sidecar of Sirius' flying motorcycle, Harry finds very little room for himself and even the few possessions he is taking with him. He ends up with his rucksack tucked uncomfortably under his feet, and Hedwig, in her cage, on his knees.

Trying to avoid the first strike of the Death Eaters, Hagrid turns the motorcycle so sharply that it turns upside down; Harry has to grab for Hedwig's cage and the rucksack, and watches his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Brooms|Firebolt]] fall to earth. Green flashes fly past, and Hedwig falls dead to the bottom of her cage. When the sidecar breaks free of the motorcycle, Harry manages to keep it in the air while Hagrid loops around to pick him up, but Harry can only take his rucksack. To disable one of the following Death Eaters, Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Confringo|destroys]] the sidecar, feeling a dreadful pang of regret for Hedwig as he does so.

As they wait for the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] to activate to take them to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] from the house of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]]' parents [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]], Hagrid asks Harry about Hedwig, and is shocked to hear that she has been killed.

In the Forest of Dean, Harry hears an owl hoot and is reminded of Hedwig.

== Strengths ==

Hedwig is exceptionally intelligent for an owl, being able to follow more complex instructions such as to &quot;keep pecking them until they've written decent-length answers&quot;, and to send packages addressed to &quot;Snuffles&quot; to Sirius. She also fought to get away from Umbridge, despite being wounded, although Umbridge managed to get the letter, suggesting that she is capable of loyalty and other &quot;human&quot; emotions.

== Weaknesses ==

Hedwig is a snowy owl, very beautiful but easily seen and recognized.  Snowy owls are not native to Britain and Hedwig was known to belong to Harry.  Therefore, Harry could not use Hedwig to deliver messages when security and anonymity were required.  Hedwig was easily offended and sulked when Harry used other owls for messages to Sirius.

Hedwig was a headstrong and proud owl who displayed an exaggerated sense of propriety. Hedwig quite obviously disapproved of the undignified enthusiasm of Ron's owl Pigwidgeon.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Hedwig is very loyal to Harry Potter.  During Harry's summer breaks at the Dursleys', Hedwig is often Harry's only companion and link to the Wizarding World. For Harry's sake, particularly in the early years, Hedwig puts up with quite a bit of discomfort and deprivation through the summer months at Privet Drive.

When Harry had loaned Hedwig to others, Hedwig seemed to accept the situation easily. For instance, when he loaned her to Hermione so that she could pass the news of her becoming a Prefect to her family, Hedwig quite cheerfully rode her shoulder while the message was being prepared, then returned to Hermione until Hermione brought her back to Harry.

Hedwig seemed sympathetic to the plight of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Errol|Errol]], the Weasley family's geriatric owl, at one point allowing Errol to share her perch, water, and food, and on another occasion actually helping Errol carry a package to Harry. Towards the over-exuberant Pigwidgeon, however, she seemed to show much more disdain, and went to great lengths to demonstrate how a post owl '''ought''' to behave.

== Analysis ==
J.K. Rowling, in interviews, described the death of Hedwig as the end of Harry's innocence.  Hedwig died four days before Harry came of age at 17 years old.

Harry found the name &quot;Hedwig&quot; in his textbook ''A History of Magic''.  In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] history there is a Saint Hedwig, who was the Duchess of Silesia and was canonized in 1267.  The Sisters of St. Hedwig was founded in 1859 and are dedicated to the education of orphaned and abandoned children, children not unlike Harry.</text>

For the beginner, I think that -san, -sama, -chan, -kun, and -sensei are probably more than adequate. The other honorifics should be moved to a different page.

This page also has way too much explanation and almost no examples. I think that a beginning student would find this page very hard to understand.

: Alternatively, we could keep them on this page, but put them under a new section such as &quot;rarely used honorifics&quot;. This way they are all in place, but the reader knows that they should just familiarise themselves with the suffixes, but not to bother studying/memorising them. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 16:42, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

:: just do not say &quot;rarely used&quot;, just additional or less used or something like that, because they are not entirely rare, and as our course is deep, as opposed to easy fast, I would really like it to list at least as much usable information as I did. --[[User:Lastguru|lastguru]] 18:57, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

Light is actually a form of radiation. In fact, radiation isn't always a bad thing. Some of it is actually quite useful like light, microwaves and radio waves. Those are some of the types of electromagnetic radiation you encounter everyday. You probably guessed by now that light is a type of wave. Well, it is! But at the same time, it also has particle-like characteristics. In this section, we will examine the nature of light and whether it is a wave, a particle or both.

== The Electromagnetic Spectrum ==

To understand light, we need to understand the electromagnetic spectrum. Basically, this spectrum shows different forms of electromagnetic radiation and where they belong on the spectrum. There are a few trends to the spectrum which will be discussed later.


'''What is Electromagnetic Radiation?'''

A lot of people seem to associate radiation with nuclear waste and things that cause cancer. However, in science, it has a much more general definition. Radiation is a way to transfer energy and have it propagate, or spread out, as it travels. Now that you know light is a form a radiation, you can see evidence of this every time you use a flash light. Notice how the beam's diameter increases the farther it is away from the source? This is a property of a wave (which will be discussed in more detail in section 1.1.1 - What is a wave?).

As for the &quot;electromagnetic&quot; part, that refers to the fluctuating electric and magnetic fields that make up the waves.


'''The Speed Limit of the Universe'''

Aside from the fact that all EM (electromagnetic) radiation are composed of varying electric and magnetic fields that spread out as they travel, there is one other very important similarity between all of them; they all travel at the speed of light.

The fact that there is a speed of light means that light does not appear instantaneously, as opposed to what some great minds thought in ancient times. The speed of light, which is usually denoted with the letter 'c', is 299 792 458 m/s or about 186 000 miles/s. That is fast enough to past through the center of the Earth and reach the other side in about 1/50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of a second. Just imagine how difficult it was to measure the speed of light back then!

The reason why the speed of light is so important is because it is the fastest speed in the universe. Nothing can surpass it. Which is why sometimes it is considered &quot;the speed limit of the universe&quot;.


'''Different Forms of EM Radiation'''

Now that you know some of the similarities between all EM radiation, you're probably wondering what the difference is. The difference could be explained in three different ways: 1) wavelength, 2) frequency and 3) energy. In this section we will only talk about energy. The other two, wavelength and frequency, will be discussed later in section 1.1.1 - What is a wave?

If you take a look at the spectrum, you will see &quot;low energy radiation&quot; and &quot;high energy radiation&quot; labelled on the diagram. Obviously, this indicates that radiation near the top, like radio waves and microwaves have low energies while radiation near the bottom, like x-rays and gamma rays, have high energies. That is the only difference between all EM waves; they differ by their energy levels.

As you can see, light is a very small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Even within that small region, it could be isolated and referred to as a &quot;sub-spectrum&quot;, this one, however, you should be more familiar with.


'''The Colors of the Rainbow'''

This &quot;sub-spectrum&quot; or the range of visible light occupies a very small part of the EM spectrum. Compared to the other types of EM radiation, it takes up the least space on the spectrum.

That small region, however, is split up into all the different colors of the rainbow. Starting from red and ending at violet. This range must also be consistent with the EM spectrum since it is within it, therefore, red is the lowest energy color and violet is the highest energy color. All of this is shown in the diagram above.

Have you ever heard that white and black are not considered colors? Well, that's true. White is actually a combination of all the colors and black is the absent of all the colors. You can see the effects of this when a prism splits up white light into its component colors.

== Light as a Particle ==

So far, we have discussed light in terms of being a wave. But what about its particle-like characteristics?

To begin, you need to know what a photon is. A photon is a massless particle that travels at the speed of light and carries a certain amount of energy, which we call a quantum (pl: quanta). EM Radiation could also be considered a stream of photons, each carrying a certain amount of energy. The more energetic the radiation is, the more energy its photons are carrying. For example, photons of red light carry less energy that photons of violet light.

== Wave-Particle Duality ==

So you're probably anxious to answer the question &quot;which is it: wave or particle&quot;? Either that, or you're anxious to finish reading this article.

Well, the truth is, the question cannot be easily answered. Light can exhibit both wave and particle characteristics. This concept is known as the &quot;wave-particle duality&quot; and it is the reason why modern physics or quantum physics was invented.

This leads us to the next section of the wikibook, entitled &quot;Light - Wave or stream of particles?&quot; If you think this section is confusing, you haven't seen anything yet. The next section enters the mysterious world of quantum mechanics: a world that has puzzled many great minds in the past, including a brilliant physicist named Albert Einstein.

The '''Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies''' recipe here, unlike many other cookie recipes which are manipulations of straight flour-based cookies, was made specifically for use with oats in it.

==Ingredients==

* 1 and 1/2 (350g) cup of flour
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder
* 1 cup (240g) of brown sugar
* 2/3 (two third) (150g) cups of shortening
* 2 tablespoons of milk
* 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
* 1 cup (240g) of oatmeal
* 1/4 cup (60g) of chocolate chips
* 1/4 cup (60g) of walnuts
* 2 eggs
* a pinch of salt
* a teaspoon of cinnamon
* vanilla

==Procedure==

# In a large bowl beat eggs lightly to break the yolks, then mix in the shortening.
# The shortening/egg mixture should be loose, add the brown sugar and remaining liquids, mix well then add the salt to the liquid mixture.
# Mix the baking powder, soda, flour and oatmeal together in another bowl.
# Blend the liquid and solid mixes together.
# Stir in chocolate chips and walnuts
# Make balls and place onto a pan then into an oven heated to 180°C (350°F) and let bake for between 15-20 minutes.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

* Experiment with more or less chocolate chips and walnuts, tastes may vary.
* Lightly coat the nuts and chips with flour before adding to the mixture.

'''Acesulfame Potassium''' is an artificial calorie-free sweetener that is 100-200 times sweeter than table [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]. It is used extensively in commercial baked goods, diet sodas, and other low sugar or calorie products. It is marketed under the brand name '''Ace-K'''.

There is some controversy regarding the safety of acesulfame potassium in food.

Another essential part of Visual Basic is file Input/Output, that is, working with files. While programming, you may want at some point to save data so they may be accessible for further use. This is where file I/O comes in. VB allows us to perform most operations available in Windows Explorer and DOS command line. Before you can do this, you need to understand how file I/O works.

==Layout of Data==
VB generally arranges data into records and fields for the programmer's convenience. The best way to explain this is by illustrating it:
  Bob,Larry,George
  Kevin,Ken,Alec
This is obviously data containing names. Each line of data is called a record. So the first record contains Bob, Larry, and George. A field is each item in a record. So the first field in the first record would be Bob, the second field would be Larry, and so on. There may be as many fields and records as you see fit.&lt;br&gt;
Records and fields are created really just for the programmer's convenience. For greater flexibility, you can also view the whole thing as a string. And you can split the string into records and fields yourself with the built-in Split() function.

==Input==
When a program receives data from an outside source, it is considered input. In Visual Basic, this source is usually a standard text file, with a .txt file extension(as which could be read with Notepad). First, you need to open the file from which you want to read the data. This is done using the following code:
  Open &lt;filename&gt; For &lt;mode&gt; As &lt;channelnumber&gt;
For example:
  Open &quot;c:\filename.txt&quot; For Input As #1
The file path can be anything you want, if it doesn't exist, a new file (and directory(s)) will be created. The extension of the file doesn't matter much. It will not affect the content of the file nor the process of writing/reading the file. So you can also do this:
  Open &quot;c:\filename.myfile&quot; For Input As #1
Or this:
  Open &quot;c:\filename&quot; For Input As #1
The open and file path are self explanatory. However, &quot;for input&quot; states it is being used to receive data from an outside file, VB is &quot;inputting&quot; data from a file into variables . When outputting(writing to a file), this is changed to &quot;for output&quot;. When we want to open a file in binary, it's &quot;for binary&quot;. &quot;As #1&quot; is which channel is being used. When you are seeking specific information from the file you would use &quot;for random&quot;. A channel could be seen as Visual Basic setting up a pathway to the file. Only one file can be used on a channel at a time. So if you want to open multiple files without closing any, you can use different channels. To input a line of data, it is fairly simply:
  Input &lt;channel&gt;, &lt;variables&gt;
For example:
  Input #1, x, y, z
This will read data from whatever channel 1 is connected to. It will store the first field of the current record into X, and the second field into Y, and the third into Z.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, we should ALWAYS close the file after the work is done. The syntax is simple:
  Close &lt;channel&gt;
As an example:
  Close #1
&lt;br&gt;More on using input will be covered in the &quot;Use of Data&quot; section.


Note: If the code will be part of a larger program, the channel number should be obtained in a dynamic way instead of a hard-coded number.  This is done using the function '''FreeFile()'''
   Dim nLogFile As Long
   nLogFile = FreeFile()
   Open &quot;c:\filename&quot; For Input As #nLogFile
   ...
   Close #nLogFile

==Output==
Output is very similar to input. The only difference is, well, it sends information OUT of the program and into a file. Once again, we shall only use text files (.txt). First you must open the file:
  Open &quot;C:\filepath.txt&quot; For Output As #1
You may have noticed, the only thing that differs from opening a file for input, is the &quot;For Output&quot;. Once this is done, everything else is simple.
  Write #1, x, 5
Assuming X = 3, if you open the text document it will look like:
  3, 5
You can write any value or variable to a file, however it is important to note that, when writing a string, it should be placed in quotes. If it is a variable containing a string, this is done automatically. Another important note is that two consecutive write statements will write to separate lines. For example:
  Write #1, 5, 4
  Write #1, 7, 4
  Write #1, &quot;this is a string&quot;
Will appear in the file as
  5, 4
  7, 4
  &quot;this is a string&quot;
Keep in mind, when outputting to a file, it will ERASE all prior information in the text. To add on to existed information, the &quot;Append&quot; command must be used.

If you are writing data to a file for use by some other program, you may find that you don't want the quotes that VB puts around your strings. You can avoid writing the quotes by using the Print command instead of the Write command. For example:
  Print #1, &quot;this is a string&quot;
Will appear in the file as
  this is a string
If, during runtime, the file at hand was modified, and a new line was added which contained necessary data, and the open statement ended as &quot;#1&quot;, whatever was in line 1 of the file would be written over(only if the file was opened as Output).  To solve this, a variable is dimmed as FreeFile (Dim FF as FreeFile).  This will open the first free slot or line in the file at hand.  The new Open statement would become:
  Open &quot;C:\filepath.txt&quot; For Output As FF
(will erase file)
  Open &quot;C:\filepath.txt&quot; For Append As FF
(will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; erase file)&lt;br&gt;
Using the second statement, the first free line in the file will be written to.

==How to specify the path to a file==
In practice it is rare for open statements to look like this:

  Open &quot;C:\filepath.txt&quot; For Append As FF

Usually the path to the file will be held in a ''string'' variable:

  Dim s As String
  s = &quot;C:\filepath.txt&quot; 
  Open s For Append As FF

The variable, ''s'', simply needs to hold a path to the file.  The path can be an absolute path such as:

  s = &quot;d:\users\me\my file.txt&quot;

or a file in the current directory (use ''CurDir'' to find out what that is):

  s = &quot;my file.txt&quot;

or a path relative to the current directory like this:

  s = &quot;..\you\your file.txt&quot;

or like this:

  s = &quot;mysub\myother file.txt&quot;

For the more adventurous it can also include a reference to a shared file on a server that doesn't use a drive letter:

  s = &quot;\\someserver\someshare\somefile.txt&quot;


==Examples==
An example form using file reading can be found [http://www.freewebs.com/3zzzpmk/TextView.frm here.]  Right click 'here' in Internet Explorer and then 'Save Target As...' to save the form file.

Please upload more files with examples. It will be really helpful for the developer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Data types in Visual Basic can be divided into three groups:

* '''Native''': Types that are understood directly by the Visual Basic compiler without assistance from the programmer
* '''User-defined''': commonly referred to by the initials UDT, meaning User defined Type, these correspond to Pascal records or C structs
* '''Classes''': the basis for object oriented programming in Visual Basic. Classes include forms, add-ins, and database designers.

==Built in Types==

The built in types are:

;Byte: 8 bit, unsigned
;Integer: 16 bit, signed
;Long:32 bit signed
;Single:32 bit floating point, range about &lt;math&gt;\pm 10^{38}&lt;/math&gt;
;Double:64 bit IEEE floating point, range about &lt;math&gt;\pm 10^{308}&lt;/math&gt;
;Currency: exact representation of decimal numbers of up to four decimal places
;String: dynamically allocated Unicode strings, theoretical capacity about &lt;math&gt;2^{9}&lt;/math&gt; characters.
;Collection: an associative array of Variants.
;Date: 8 byte date/time value range January 1, 100 to December 31, 9999
;Object: a holder for any type of Object.
;Variant: a holder for any type of value or object.

== Byte, Integer &amp; Long ==

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim a as Byte
  Dim i as Integer
  Dim x,y as Long 'Define two variables. Note that only the last variable will be a long integer.
&lt;/source&gt;

Now those variables will only be capable of storing integer values (without decimal). Long integers can store a number with a bigger range of value than integers but they occupy a bigger space of RAM.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Type    !! Storage !! Range of Values
|-
| Byte    || 1 byte  || 0 to 255
|-
| Integer || 2 bytes || -32,768 to 32,767
|-
| Long    || 4 bytes || -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
|}

Some functions you need to know: Int()

Int() converts a decimal value into an integer value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim i as Integer
  i=Int(3.9)
  Print i 'Prints 3
&lt;/source&gt;

==Single &amp; Double==
These data types can store decimal values. &quot;Double&quot; compared to &quot;Single&quot; is similar to the &quot;Long&quot; compared to &quot;Integer&quot;:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Type || Storage || Range of Values
|-
| Single || 4 bytes || -3.402823E+38 to -1.401298E-45 for negative values

1.401298E-45 to 3.402823E+38 for positive values.
|-
| Double || 8 bytes || -1.79769313486232E+308 to -4.94065645841247E-324 for negative values

4.94065645841247E-324 to 1.79769313486232E+308 for positive values.
|}

Some useful functions: Round()

Round() rounds off a decimal to a certain number of decimal digits that the programmer wants. The first argument should be a decimal value which you want to round off. The second argument specifies the number of decimal digits you want, for example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
       Dim pi as Double
       pi=3.141592653589
       pi=Round(pi,2) 'Rounds off 3.141592653589 to only two decimal digits
       Print pi 'Prints 3.14
&lt;/source&gt;

==String==
A string is an array of characters. As an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
       Dim a As String
       a = &quot;This is a string&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Strings can be concatenated (connected together to form a new string) using the &quot;&amp;&quot; operator. For example,

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
       dim b as String
       b = &quot;Wiki&quot; &amp; &quot;book&quot; &amp; &quot;s&quot;
       Print b 'Prints &quot;Wikibooks&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

A normal string variable occupies 10 bytes of RAM, plus the string's size, and can hold up to 2 billion characters!

'''Some frequently used built-in string constants: vbTab, vbCrLf'''

vbTab contains a string that does the same thing as the Tab key on your keyboard, while vbCrLf creates a character return and a line feed(similar to the Enter key):

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Print &quot;Jack:&quot; &amp; vbTab &amp; &quot;1 pie&quot; &amp; vbCrLf &amp; &quot;me:&quot; &amp; vbTab &amp; &quot;10 pies&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

Will print:

 Jack:    1 pie
 me:      10 pies

To include special characters and quotation marks in the strings, the Chr() function may be used:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
       Dim a As String
       Print &quot;A quotation mark: [&quot; &amp; Chr(34) &amp; &quot;]&quot;
       a = &quot;Replace 'apostrophes' for quotation marks&quot;
       Replace( a, &quot;'&quot;, Chr(34) )
       Print a
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Some string functions: Str(),Val(),inStr(),Mid(),Replace(),Trim()'''

In fact there are tons of built-in string manipulation functions available. But right now, I'll just introduce two: Str() and Val().

Str() converts any numerical value into a string value while Val() converts a string value into a numerical value(only when it's convertible).

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
       Dim MyString As String
       Dim MyNumber As Single
       MyString=Str(300) 'converts a number into a string
       MyNumber=Val(&quot;300&quot;) 'converts a string into a number
&lt;/source&gt;

Even if you don't do the conversion, you will not end up getting Type Mismatch Errors. However, it is considered better to use explicit type conversions, because it is easier to debug.

Even if you do be prepared for next to impossible to debug problems caused by VB refusing to convert something and refusing to tell you what the heck it is. VB is extremely touchy and raises an exception at the least expected times.

==Structure==
An example definition of a structured type:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Type E2Point
  x As Double
  y As Double
End Type
Sub Test()
  Dim MyPoint As E2Point
  Dim MyPoint2 As E2Point
  MyPoint.x = 4
  MyPoint.y = -5
  MyPoint2 = MyPoint 'Make a copy
  MyPoint2.x = 3
  MyPoint2.y = -6
  Debug.Print MyPoint.x, MyPoint.y '4, -5: not overriden with 3 and -6
  Debug.Print TypeOf MyPoint Is E2Point 'True
  Debug.Print TypeOf MyPoint Is Object 'False
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;
The type has to be defined outside of a procedure.

A variable of a structure type is not an object.

==Enumeration==
An example definition of an enumerated type:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Enum Colors
  Red '=0
  Green '=1
  Blue '=2
End Enum
Enum Colors2
  Red2 = 1
  Green2 '=2
  Blue2 '=3
End Enum
Sub Test()
  Debug.Print Red, Green, Blue
  Debug.Print Red2, Green2, Blue2
  Dim MyVar As Colors 'Ends up being typed as Long
  MyVar = 8 'Does not lead to an error: no restriction on values
End Sub 
&lt;/source&gt;

==Type Test==
To find out about the type of a variable, you can use &quot;'''TypeOf''' ... '''Is''' ...&quot; test. The tested types can only be object types and structure types, but the test can be applied to any variable, whether typed as an integer, a string or an object.

An example of TypeOf in Excel:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyVar = Selection
Debug.Print &quot;Selection is an object: &quot; &amp; TypeOf MyVar Is Object
Debug.Print &quot;Selection is a range: &quot; &amp; TypeOf MyVar Is Range
Debug.Print &quot;Sheets is of type Sheets: &quot; &amp; TypeOf Sheets Is Sheets
MyStr = &quot;Hello&quot;
Debug.Print &quot;Text is an object: &quot; &amp; TypeOf MyStr Is Object
If TypeOf MyVar Is Range Then
  Set MyCells = MyVar.Cells
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

An example test with a &quot;Select Case True&quot;:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Set MyVar = new Collection
Select Case True
Case TypeOf MyVar is Range
  Debug.Print &quot;Range&quot;
Case TypeOf MyVar is Collection
  Debug.Print &quot;Collection&quot;
Case Else
  Debug.Print &quot;Other cases&quot;
End Select
&lt;/source&gt;

You can further find out about a type using '''IsObject''' and '''TypeName''' functions:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Debug.Print IsObject(Selection) 'True
Debug.Print IsObject(&quot;Hello&quot;) 'False
Debug.Print TypeName(&quot;Hello&quot;) 'String
Debug.Print TypeName(4) 'Integer
Debug.Print TypeName(3.5) 'Double
Debug.Print TypeName(Selection) 'Range
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Film Noir&quot; is a term that was applied to a style of American cinema that was popular in the 1930's and 40's.  The term translates to &quot;Black Film,&quot; which refers to both the characteristic lighting and the dark subject matter.  Noir films often depict different aspects of the criminal underworld, and are most commonly set in the 'mean streets' of the city.

Many of the most recognizable early noir films were mysteries involving a hard-boiled detective like Sam Spade (played by Humphrey Bogart) who gets involved with a woman who hires him to delve into the criminal underworld to solve a case.  Many of these tales are based on dime-store novels (also known as &quot;pulp fiction&quot;) written by authors like Dashell Hammett (&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;).

Other popular noirs of the period often tell the tale of an average joe who is put into a difficult situation that continues to get worse, pushing him to his ethical, mental, physical, or moral limits.
 
Noir is most distinguished by its effective interplay of light and shadow.  Noirs are lit very darkly, with beams of light being used to highlight certain important elements of the scene, actors, or action.  For example, a hero character would be well-lit, while the villain lurked in the shadows.  Someone who was of a questionable nature could pass in between the light and shadow, perhaps with a diagonal shadow hiding their eyes while the rest of their body is well-lit.

One of the biggest requirements for a noir was the presence of the femme-fatale character.  This was often a very beautiful woman, attractively dressed, who seduced the hero into her world of darkness like a black widow spider.  She could be the detective's client, the gypsy who knows a little too much, the girlfriend or wife of the protagonist, or commonly the villain in the story.

Noir films continue to be made today, but purists often dub them &quot;neo-noir,&quot; saving the term &quot;film noir&quot; for the period of films between the 1930's and 1950's.  Some popular examples of neo-noir are: Chinatown, The Two Jakes, The Grifters, Blood Simple, Fargo, Pulp Fiction, L.A. Confidential, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Body Heat, Devil in a Blue Dress and Sin City.   Some popular directors of neo-noir are: the Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, and David Lynch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We will now move into a more advanced aspect of VB - OOP.  But don't
worry, Object Oriented Programming is quite simple, in fact it is
probably simpler for those who have never programmed before than for
those with long experience of traditional Fortran/Basic/Pascal (pick
your favourite imperative language).


You should be familiar with VB's event-driven programming style by now. However I'll explain it again. When you're doing general VB programming, your thoughts should go in this pattern: &quot;If the user does this, what should happen? How would I make it happen?&quot; Then you would write the program to fit the answers to these questions. That is event-driven programming. You program according to what events the user would trigger. Dragging a picture, clicking a button, and typing a word are all events.

You, being the brave coder that you are, would ask: &quot;WHY do I HAVE to think like that??&quot;

Well here's an alternative way for you to think: Object Oriented Programming(OOP). In the world of OOP, you break a problem down into small parts and solve them individually. If you are to program in an object oriented style, you would think of every variable or functions as a property of an object, and everything would seem like an object to you. OOP is hard to explain so you'll have to experience it in the following examples.

Imagine that you have a bottle of juice. What properties does it have?
What events does it have?(What can it do?) Here's a list I could think
of:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Private Colour As String  'What colour?
  Private Fruit As String   'What kind of fruit?
  Private Volume As Single  'How much?
  Public Sub MakeJuice(c As String, f As String, v As Single)  'Make some
    Colour = c
    Fruit = f
    Volume = v
  End Sub
  
  Public Sub Evaporate()   'Well, that's the only thing I could think of
    Volume = Volume - 10
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Behold. That's our first class. Don't worry about anything right now. I will go over those later. Anyway, let's assume that this class is named, &quot;Juice&quot;. Think of it as a general description of a bottle of juice. Now we can create an actual bottle of apple juice:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Private AppleJuice As Juice  'Define
  Set AppleJuice = New Juice   'Create a new instance of Juice
  AppleJuice.MakeJuice &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, 30
&lt;/source&gt;

Watch:
 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  AppleJuice.Evaporate   '20 units left
  AppleJuice.Evaporate   '10 left
  AppleJuice.Evaporate   'Yes!!
&lt;/source&gt;

&quot;Wait&quot;, you interrupted my rant once again, &quot;but why do I have to use OOP? Just because you hate apple juice?&quot;

OOP is good for large-scale programming - As your code grows large, there are going to be more and more procedures/functions to your program, and your code is going to be so cluttered that one more look at it, you'd scream. That is why I'm teaching you OOP! (So instead of looking at hundreds of scattered procedures/functions, you look at organized Objects.)

==Types==

You can think of a type as a simple form of class. Types can only hold variables, not procedures/functions.

An important distinction between user defined types ('UDT') and 'classes' in 'VB6' is that 'UDTs' are ''value types'' while 'classes' are ''reference types''.  This means that when you store an object ('instance' of a 'class') in a variable what actually happens is that a pointer to the existing object is stored but when you store a 'UDT' instance in a variable a ''copy'' of the instance is stored.  For instance imagine that you have defined a class, 'Class1', and a UDT, 'Type1':

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim ac As Class1
  Dim bc As Class1 
  Dim at As Type1
  Dim bt As Type1
&lt;/source&gt;

Now assign ac to bc:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Set bc = ac&lt;/source&gt;

and at to bt

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;bt = at&lt;/source&gt;

Now make a change to one of the properties of bc and look at the corresponding property in ac.  You should see that when you change bc that ac also changes.  This is because ac and bc are really pointers to the same block of memory.  If you do the same exercise with bt and at you should see that changing properties of bt does not affect at.  This is because at and bt are values not references and occupy distinct locations in memory.

This is important when storing objects in 'Collections'.  If you add an object to a collection you can later change the values of its properties and the object in the collection will also seem to change.  in fact it is the same object because what is stored in the collection is the reference ('pointer') to the object.  However if you store a 'UDT' in a collection what is stored is a ''copy'' of the ''values'' not a reference so changing the original UDT will not affect the content of the Collection.

==Classes==

Classes are a combination of subroutines and types.  By that I mean that when you write a class it looks very much like a [[../Data Types|type]] but is also contains subroutines and functions.

Each class in VB6 is a distinct file, there can only be one class in a file and the class cannot be spread out in several files; this is a feature of VB6 not a requirement of object oriented programming. 

A class looks very much like an ordinary module but has the file extension ''.cls'' instead of ''.bas''

==Inheritance==
There are two types of inheritance: implementation and interface.  However Visual Basic Classic provides only Interface inheritance.  Implementation inheritance can be simulated by a combination of interface inheritance and delegation.

One of the common ways to introduce inheritance is to show a program that creates dog and cat objects or car and train objects.

For example in Visual Basic we can declare two classes dog and cat like this:

===Class cDog===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  
  Public Sub Sound()
    Debug.Print &quot;Woof&quot;
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

===Class cCat===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  
  Public Sub Sound()
    Debug.Print &quot;Meow&quot;
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

===module main===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Sub main()
    Dim oDog as cDog
    Dim oCat as cCat
  
    Set oDog = New cDog
    Set oCat = New cCat
  
    oDog.Sound
    oCat.Sound
  
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

When you run this program it will print:

  Woof
  Meow

Now this is all very well until you decide that you would like an array of pets:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim aPets(1 to 10) as ????&lt;/source&gt;

Unless you declare the ''aPets'' array as ''variant'' you have to give it a type.  One way is to create a class called ''cPet'' and use it instead of cDog and cCat:

===Class cPet===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  
  Public IsDog as Boolean
  
  Public Sub Sound()
    If IsDog Then
      Debug.Print &quot;Woof&quot;
    Else
      Debug.Print &quot;Meow&quot;
    End If
  
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Now our ''main'' routine might look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  
  Dim aPet(1 to 10) as cPet
  
  Public Sub main()
  
    Dim lPet as Long
    For lPet = 1 to 10
      Set aPet(lPet) = New cPet
      If lPet&lt;=5 then
        aPet(lPet).IsDog = True
      Else
        aPet(lPet).IsDog = False
      End If
    Next lPet    
 
    ' Now find out what noise they make.
    For lPet = 1 to 10
      aPet(lPet).Sound
    Next lPet
  
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

This should print:

  Woof
  Woof
  Woof
  Woof
  Woof
  Meow
  Meow
  Meow
  Meow
  Meow

Look reasonable?  For the requirements so far revealed this works fine.  But what happens when you discover that there are things that cats do that have no analogue in dogs?  What about other kinds of pet?  For example, you want your cat to ''purr''.  You can have a method called ''purr'' but where will you put it?  It surely doesn't belong in cPet because dogs can't purr and neither can guinea pigs or fish.

The thing to do is to separate out those features that are common to all ''pets'' and create a class that deals only with those, we can rewrite ''cPet'' for this purpose.  Now we can go back to our original ''cDog'' and ''cCat'' classes and modify them to ''inherit'' the 'interface'' from ''cPet''.

===Class cPet rewritten===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  
  Public Sub Sound()
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that the ''Sound'' method is empty.  this is because it exists only to define the interface.  The interface is like the layout of the pins on a plug or socket; any plug that has the same layout, size and shape will plug in to a socket implementing the same interface.  What goes on inside the thing you plug in is a separate issue; vacuum cleaners and television sets both use the same mains plug.

To make this work we must now modify cDog and cCat:

===Class cDog===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  Implements cPet
  
  Private Sub cPet_Sound()
    Debug.Print &quot;Woof&quot;
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

===Class cCat===
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  Implements cPet
  Private Sub cPet_Sound()
    Debug.Print &quot;Meow&quot;
  End Sub
  
  Public Sub Purr()
    Debug.Print &quot;Purr&quot;
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==Collections==
In the pet examples above an array of cPet objects is used to hold the pets.  This works well if you know exactly how many pets you have.  But what happens if you adopt another stray puppy or your cat has kittens?

One solution is to use a Collection object instead of an array.  A collection object looks a little like an array but lets you add and remove items without worrying about the declared size, it just expands and contracts automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When programming effectively in any computer language, whether it is
VB or C++ for example, there should be consistency to your style, it
should be organized, and should aim to be as efficient as possible in
terms of speed of execution and use of resources (such as memory or
network traffic). With established programming techniques, errors can
be reduced to a minimum and be more easily recognized, and it will make
the job of the programmer much easier and more enjoyable.

There are many different aspects to writing reliable programs. For a
short program used interactively and only by the author it can be
reasonable to break all the rules in the service of quickly getting
the answer. However, if that little programs grows into a large
program you will end up wishing that you had started on the right
path. Each programming language has its strengths and weaknesses and
a technique that assists in writing good programs in one might be
unnecessary, impossible or counterproductive in another; what is
presented here applies to VB6 in particular but much of it is standard
stuff that applies or is enforced in Pascal, C, Java and other similar
imperative languages.

== General Guidelines ==

These suggestions will be described in greater detail further below.
None of these can be called rules and some are controversial, you have
to make up your own mind based on the costs and benefits

* Write comments that explain why you do what you do. If the code or the problem being solved is especially complex you should also explain why you chose the method you did instead of some other more obvious method.

* Indent your code. This can make reading the code for others easier and makes it easy to spot where statements have not been closed off properly. This is especially important in multiply nested statements.

* Declare all variables, enforce this by placing ''Option Explicit'' at the top of every code module,

* Use meaningful variable and sub routine names. The variable FileHandle means a lot more to us humans than X. Also avoid the tendency of abbreviating names as this can also make it hard to read code. Don't use FilHan where FileHandle would be clearer,

* In the argument list of functions and subs declare all arguments as ''ByRef''. This forces the compiler to check the datatypes of the variables you pass in,

* Declare variables, subs, and functions in the smallest possible scope: prefer Private over Friend and Friend over Public.

* Have as few variables as possible declared Public in .bas modules; such variables are public to the whole component or program.

* Group related functions and subs together in a module, create a new module for unrelated routines,

* If a group of variables and procedures are closely related consider creating a class to ''encapsulate'' them together,

* Include ''assertions'' in the code to ensure that routines are given correct data and return correct data,
* Write and execute ''tests'',

* Make the program work first and work fast afterwards

* Where a variable can hold a limited range of discrete values that are known at compile time use an 'enumerated type'',

* Break large programs into separate components (DLLs or class libraries) so that you can reduce the visibility of data and routines, to just those other pieces of code that need to use them,

* Use a simple prefix notation to show the type of variables and the scope of routines.

== Declaring variables ==

Earlier in this book, you may have been taught to declare variables
with a simple Dim statement, or not at all. Declaring variables on
different levels is a crucial skill. Think of your program as three
branches: The module (open to all forms), individual forms, and the
sub programs themselves. If you declare a variable in your module, the
variable will retain its value through all forms. A dim statement will
work, but it is tradition to use &quot;Public&quot; in its place. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Public X as Integer&lt;/source&gt;

Declaring something at the top of your form code will make it private
to that form, therefore, if you have X=10 in one form, and X=20 in
another, they will not interfere. If the variable was declared public,
then there would be interactions between the values. To declare
something in your form, it is traditional to use &quot;Private&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Private X as Integer&lt;/source&gt;

And finally, there are the subprograms. Dimensioning variables only to
a subprogram is highly effective, this way you can use default
variables (such as sum for sums) in all subs without the need to worry
about one value changing because of another section of code. There is,
however, a twist. Dim, what you are accustomed to, will not retain the
value of the variable after the sub is done. So after rerunning the
sub, all the local variables in the sub will be reset. To get around
this, a &quot;Static&quot; may be used.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Static X as Integer&lt;/source&gt;

Some of you may want to take the easy way out, and just use Public on
everything. However, it is best to declare something on the smallest
level possible. Generally arguments are the best way to send variables
from one sub to the other. This is because arguments make it far
easier to track exactly where variables are being changed in case of a
logic error, and almost limits the amount of damage a bad section of
code can do. Declaring variables is, again, useful when using default
variables. Common default variables are:

  I for loops
  J for loops
  Sum(self explanatory)
  X for anything

So, rather then making variables I and II or Sum1,Sum2, you can see
why keeping variables local is a useful skill.

== Comments ==

Every programmer I know dislikes writing comments. I don't mean just illiterate script-kiddies writing some brain dead Visual Basic Script to delete all the files from some poor grandmother's PC, I mean them and everyone up to people with multiple Ph.D.s and honorary doctorates.

So if you find it difficult to convince yourself that comments are a good idea you are in good company.

Unfortunately this isn't a case of you and I being as good as them but of them being as bad as us. Good comments can be critical to the longevity of a program; if a maintenance programmer can't understand how your code was supposed to work he might have to rewrite it. If he does that he will also have to write more comments and more tests. He will almost certainly introduce more bugs and it will be your fault because you didn't have the courtesy to explain why your program was written the way it was. Maintenance programmers are often not part of the original team so they don't have any shared background to help them understand, they just have a bug report, the code and a deadline. If you don't write the comments you can be sure that no one will add them later.

Comments need to be written with the same care and attention as the code itself. Sloppily written comments that simply repeat what the code says are a waste of time, better to say nothing at all. The same goes for comments that contradict the code; what is the reader meant to believe, the code or the comment. If the comment contradicts the code someone might 'fix' the code only to find that it was actually the comment that was broken.

Here are some example comments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim cbMenuCommandBar As Office.CommandBarButton 'command bar object&lt;/source&gt;

That comes from one of my own programs that I created by hacking at a template provided by someone else. Why he added the comment is beyond me, it adds nothing to the code which contains the word CommandBar twice anyway!

Here is another from a similar program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Public WithEvents MenuHandler As CommandBarEvents 'command bar event handler&lt;/source&gt;

Same degree of pointlessness. Both examples are from programs that I use everyday.

Another from the same program which shows both a good comment and a pointless one:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Sub Remove(vntIndexKey As Variant)
    'used when removing an element from the collection
    'vntIndexKey contains either the Index or Key, which is why
    'it is declared as a Variant
    'Syntax: x.Remove(xyz)
  
    mCol.Remove vntIndexKey
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

The first comment line simply repeats the information contained in the name, the last comment line tells us only what we can easily glean from the declaration. The middle two lines say something useful, they explain the otherwise puzzling use of the ''Variant'' data type. My recommendation is to delete the first and last comment lines, not because they are incorrect but because they are pointless and make it harder to see the comment that actually matters.

To summarize: good comments explain ''why'' not ''what''. They tell the reader what the code cannot.

You can see what is happening by reading the code but it is very often hard or impossible to see why the code is written as it is. 

Comments that paraphrase the code do have a place. If the algorithm is complex or sophisticated you might need to precis it in plain human language. For example the routines that implement an equation solver need to be accompanied by a description of the mathematical method employed, perhaps with references to textbooks. Each individual line of code might be perfectly clear but the overall plan might still be obscure; a precis in simple human language can make it plain.

If you make use of a feature of VB that you know is little used you might need to point out why it works to prevent well-meaning maintenance programmers cleaning it up.

If your code is solving a complex problem or is heavily optimized for speed it will need more and better comments than otherwise but even simple code needs comments that explain why it exists and outlines what it does. Very often it is better to put a narrative at the head of a file instead of comments on individual code lines. The reader can then read the summary instead of the code.

=== Summary ===

* Comments should add clarity and meaning,
* Keep the comments short unless the complexity of the code warrants a narrative description,
* Add comments to the head of each file to explain why it exists and how to use it,
* Comment each function, subroutine and property to explain any oddities such as the use of the Object or Variant data types.
* If a function has side effects explain what they are,
* If the routine is only applicable to a certain range of inputs then say so and indicate what happens if the caller supplies something unexpected.

=== Exercises ===

* Take a piece of code written by someone else and try to understand how it works without reading the comments.
* Try to find some code that doesn't need any comments. Explain why it doesn't need them. Does such a thing exist?
* Search the web, your own code or a colleague's code to find examples of good comments.
* Put yourself in the position of a maintenance programmer called in to fix a bug in a difficult piece of your own code. Add comments or rewrite the existing comments to make the job easier.

== Avoid Defensive Programming, Fail Fast Instead ==
By defensive programming I mean the habit of writing code that attempts to compensate for some failure in the data, of writing code that assumes that callers might provide data that doesn't conform to the contract between caller and subroutine and that the subroutine must somehow cope with it.

It is common to see properties written like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Property Let MaxSlots(RHS as Long)
    mlMaxSlots = RHS
  End Property 
  
  Public Property Get MaxSlots() as Long
    if mlMaxSlots = 0 then
      mlMaxSlots = 10
    End If
    MaxSlots = mlMaxSlots
  End Property 
&lt;/source&gt;

The reason it is written like this is probably that the programmer of the class in which it sits is afraid that the author of the code that uses it will forget to initialize the object properly. So he or she provides a default value.

The problem is that the programmer of the MaxSlots property has no way of knowing how many slots that the client code will need. If the client code doesn't set MaxSlots it will probably either fail or, worse, misbehave. It is much better to write the code like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Property Let MaxSlots(RHS as Long)
    mlMaxSlots = RHS
  End Property 
  
  Public Property Get MaxSlots() as Long
    if mlMaxSlots = 0 then
      Err.Raise ErrorUninitialized, &quot;MaxSlots.Get&quot;, &quot;Property not initialized&quot;
    End If
    MaxSlots = mlMaxSlots
  End Property 
&lt;/source&gt;

Now when client code calls MaxSlots Get before calling MaxSlots Let an error will be raised. It now becomes the responsibility of the client code to fix the problem or pass on the error. In any case the failure will be noticed sooner than if we provide a default value.

Another way of viewing the distinction between ''Defensive Programming'' and ''Fail Fast'' is to see ''Fail Fast'' as strict implementation of a contract and ''Defensive Programming'' as forgiving. It can be, and is often, debated whether being forgiving is good always a good idea in human society but within a computer program it simply means that you don't trust all parts of the program to abide by the specification of the program. In this case you need to fix the specification not forgive transgressions of it.

=== Exercises ===
* Take a working non-trivial program and search the code for defensive programming,
* Rewrite the code to make it fail fast instead,
* Run the program again and see if it fails,
* Fix the client part of the program to eliminate the failure.

== Assertions and Design By Contract ==
An ''assertion'' is a statement that ''asserts'' that something is true. In VB6 you add assertions like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Debug.Assert 0 &lt; x&lt;/source&gt;

If the statement is true then the program continues as if nothing happened but if it is not then the program will stop at that line. Unfortunately VB6 has a particularly weak form of assertions, they are only executed when the code is running in the debugger. This means that they have no effect at all in the compiled program. Don't let this stop you from using them, after all this is a feature that doesn't exist at all in many common programming languages. 

If you really need the assertions to be tested in the compiled program you can do something like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If Not(0 &lt; x) Then
    Debug.Assert False
    Err.Raise ErrorCodes.AssertionFailed
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

Now the program will stop at the failure when in the IDE and raise an error when running compiled. If you plan to use this technique in more than a few places it would make sense to declare a subroutine to do it so as to reduce clutter:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Sub Assert(IsTrue as Boolean)
    If Not IsTrue Then
      Debug.Assert False
      Err.Raise ErrorCodes.AssertionFailed
    End If
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

then instead of writing ''Debug.Assert'' you write:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Assert 0 &lt; x&lt;/source&gt;

Assertions can be used to implement a form of [[w:design by contract|design by contract]]. Add assertions at the beginning of each routine that assert something about the values of the arguments to the routine and about the values of any relevant module or global variables. For instance a routine that takes a single integer argument that must be greater than zero would have an assertion of the same form as the one shown above. If it is called with a zero argument the program will halt on the line with the assertion. You can also add assertions at the exit of the routine that specify the allowed values of the return value or any side effects.

Assertions differ from explicit validation in that they do not raise errors or allow for the program to take action if the assertion fails. This is not necessarily a weakness of the assertion concept, it is central to the different ways that assertions and validation checks are used. 

Assertions are used to do several things:
* They specify the contract that must be followed by the calling and called code,
* They assist in debugging by halting execution at the earliest point at which it is known that something is wrong. Correctly written assertions catch errors long before they cause the program to blow up.

Assertions generally assist in finding logic errors during the development of a program, validation, on the other hand, is usually intended to trap poor input either from a human being or other external unreliable source. Programs are generally written so that input that fails validation does not cause the program to fail, instead the validation error is reported to a higher authority and corrective action taken. If an assertion fails it normally means that two internal parts of the program failed to agree on the terms of the contract that both were expected to comply with. If the calling routine sends a negative number where a positive one is expected and that number is not provided by the user no amount of validation will allow the program to recover so raising an error is pointless. In languages such as C failed assertions cause the program to halt and emit a stack trace but VB simply stops when running in the IDE. In VB assertions have no effect in compiled code.

Combined with comprehensive tests, assertions are a great aid to writing correct programs. Assertions can also take the place of certain types of comments. Comments that describe the allowed range of values that an argument is allowed to have are better written as assertions because they are then explicit statements in the program that are actually checked. In VB you must exercise the program in the IDE to get the benefit of the assertions, this is a minor inconvenience.

Assertions also help ensure that a program remains correct as new code is added and bugs are fixed. Imagine a subroutine that calculates the equivalent conductance of a radiator due to convection (don't worry if the physics is unfamilar):

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Function ConvectionConductance(Byval T1 as Double, Byval T2 as Double) as Double
    ConvectionConductance = 100 * Area * (T2 - T1)^0.25
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Now it so happens, if you know the physics, that conductance is always a non-negative number regardless of the relationship between the temperatures T1 and T2. This function, however, makes the assumption that T1 is always greater than, or equal to, T2. This assumption might be perfectly reasonable for program in question but it is a restriction nonetheless so it should be made part of the contract between this routine and its callers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Function ConvectionConductance(Byval T1 as Double, Byval T2 as Double) as Double
    Debug.Assert T2 &lt; T1
    ConvectionConductance = 100 * Area * (T2 - T1)^0.25
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

It is also a good a idea to assert something about the results of a routine:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Function ConvectionConductance(Byval T1 as Double, Byval T2 as Double) as Double
    Debug.Assert T2 &lt;= T1
    ConvectionConductance = 100 * Area * (T2 - T1)^0.25
    Debug.Assert 0 &lt;= ConvectionConductance
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

In this particular case it looks as if the assertion on the result is worthless because if the [[w:Precondition|precondition]] is satisfied it is obvious by inspection that the [[w:Postcondition|postcondition]] must also be satisfied. In real life the code between the [[w:Precondition|precondition]] and [[w:Postcondition|postcondition]] assertions is usually much more complicated and might include a number of calls to functions that are not under the control of the person who created the function. In such cases the [[w:Postcondition|postcondition]] should be specified even if it appears to be a waste of time because it both guards against the introduction of bugs and informs other programmers of the contract that the function is supposed to comply with.

== Tests ==
Tests vary from writing a program and then running it and looking casually at its behaviour to writing a full suite of automated tests first and then writing the program to comply.

Most of us work somewhere in between, usually nearer the first alternative than the second. Tests are frequently regarded as an extra cost but like quality control systems for physical products the supposed cost of quality is often negative because of the increased quality of the product.

You can use tests to define the specification of a function or program by writing the tests first, this is one of the practices of the Extreme Programming method. Then write the program piece by piece until all of the tests pass. For most people this seems like a counsel of perfection and entirely impractical but a certain amount of it will pay off handsomely by helping to make sure that component parts work properly before integration.

A test is usually built as a separate program that uses some of the same source code as the deliverable program. Simply writing another program that can use component parts of the deliverable will often be enough to expose weaknesses in the design.

The smaller the component that is being tested the easier it will be to write a test, however if you test very small pieces you can waste a lot of time writing tests for things that can be easily checked by eye. Automated tests are probably best applied to those parts of the program that are small enough to be extracted from the real program without disruption yet large enough to have some complex behaviour. It's hard to be precise, better to do some testing than none and experience will show you where the effort is best expended in your particular program.

You can also make the tests part of the program itself. For instance, each class could have a test method that returns true the test passes and false otherwise. This has the virtue that every time you compile the real program you compile the tests as well so any changes in the program's interface that will cause the tests to fail are likely to be captured early. Because the tests are inside the program they can also test parts that are inaccessible to external test routines.

== Scope, Visibility and Namespaces ==
{{sectstub}}

== Hungarian Notation ==

Hungarian notation is the name for the prefixes that many programmers add to variable names to denote scope and type.  The reason for doing it is to increase the readability of the code by obviating the need to keep referring to the variable declarations in order to determine the type or scope of a variable or function.

Experienced Basic programmers have been familiar with a form of this notation for a very long time because Microsoft Basic's have used suffixes to indicate type (''#'' means ''Double'', ''&amp;'' means ''Long'', etc.).

The fine details of the Hungarian Notation used in any given program don't matter very much.  The point is to be consistent so that other programmers reading your code will be able to quickly learn the conventions and abide by them.  For this reason it is wise to not overdo the notation, if there are too many different prefixes people will forget what the rarely used ones mean and that defeats the purpose.  It is better to use a generic prefix that will be remembered than a host of obscure ones that won't.

A recommendation for Hungarian Notation is described in greater detail in the [[../Coding Standards#Variable Names|Coding Standards]] chapter.

== Memory and Resource Leaks ==
You might think that because Visual Basic has no native memory allocation functions that memory leaks would never occur.  Unfortunately this is not the case; there are several ways in which a Visual Basic program can leak memory and resources.  For small utility programs memory leaks are not a serious problem in Visual Basic because the leak doesn't have a chance to get big enough to threaten other resource users before the program is shut down.

However, it is perfectly reasonable to create servers and daemons in Visual Basic and such programs run for a very long time so even a small leak can eventually bring the operating system to its knees.

In Visual Basic programs the most common cause of memory leaks is circular object references.  This problem occurs when two objects have references to each other but no other references to either object exist.  

Unfortunately the symptoms of a memory leak are hard to spot in a running program, you might only notice when the operating system starts complaining about a shortage of memory. 

Here is an example problem that exhibits the problem:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  'Class1
  Public oOther as Class1

  'module1
  Public Sub main()
    xProblem
  End Sub
  
  Private Sub xProblem
    Dim oObject1 As Class1
    Dim oObject2 As Class1
    set oObject1 = New Class1
    set oObject2 = New Class1
    set oObject1.oOther = oObject2
    set oObject2.oOther = oObject1
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Class1 is a simple class with no methods and a single Public attribute.  Not good programming practice for real programs but sufficient for the illustration.  The xProblem subroutine simply creates two instances of Class1 (objects) and links them together.  Notice that the oObject1 and oObject2 variables are local to xProblem.  This means that when the subroutine completes the to variables will be discarded.  When Visual Basic does this it decrements a counter in each object and if this counter goes to zero it executes the Class_Terminate method (if there is one) and then recovers the memory occupied by the object.  Unfortunately, in this case the reference counter can never go to zero because each object refers to the other so even though no variable in the program refers to either of the objects they will never be discarded.  Any language that uses a simple reference counting scheme for cleaning up object memory will suffer from this problem.  Traditional C and Pascal don't have the problem because they don't have garbage collectors at all.  Lisp and its relatives generally use some variant of mark and sweep garbage collection which relieves the programmer of the problem at the expense of unpredictable changes in resource load.

To demonstrate that there really is a problem add ''Initialize'' and ''Terminate'' event handlers to ''Class1'' that simply print a message to the ''Immediate Window''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Private Sub Class_Initialize()
    Debug.Print &quot;Initialize&quot;
  End Sub
  
  Private Sub Class_Terminate()
    Debug.Print &quot;Terminate&quot;
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

If the ''xProblem'' routine were working without a leak you would see an equal number of ''Initialize'' and ''Terminate'' messages.

=== Exercises ===
*Modify ''xProblem'' to ensure that both objects are disposed of when it exits (hint: setting a variable to ''Nothing'' reduces the reference count of the object it points to).

=== Avoiding and Dealing with Circular References ===
There are a number of techniques that can be used to avoid this problem beginning with the obvious one of simply never allowing circular references:

*Forbid circular references in your programing style guide,
*Explicitly clean up all references,
*Provide the functionality by another idiom.

In real programs forbidding circular references is not usually
practical because it means giving up the use of such useful data
structures as doubly linked lists.

A classic use of circular references parent-child relationships.  In
such relationships the ''parent'' is the ''master'' object and owns
the ''child'' or ''children''.  The parent and its children share some
common information and because the information is common to all of
them it is most natural that it be owned and managed by the parent.
When the parent goes out of scope the parent and all the children are
supposed to be disposed of.  Unfortunately this won't happen in Visual
Basic unless you help the process along because in order to have
access to the shared information the children must have a reference to
the parent.  This is a circular reference.


  ----------       ----------
  | parent | ---&gt;  | child  |
  |        | &lt;---  |        |
  ----------       ----------

In this particular case you can usually avoid the child to parent
reference completely by introducing a helper object.  If you partition
the parent's attributes into two sets: one which contains attributes
that only the parent accesses and another that is used by both parent
and children you can avoid the circularity by placing all those shared
attributes in the helper object.  Now both parent and have reference to
the helper object and no child needs a reference to the parent.

  ----------       ----------
  | parent | ----&gt; | child  |
  |        |       |        |
  ----------       ----------
      |                |
      |                |
      |   ----------   |
       -&gt; | common | &lt;-
          ----------  

Notice how all the arrows point away from the parent.  This means that
when our code releases the last reference to the parent that the
reference count will go to zero and that the parent will be disposed
of.  This,in turn, releases the reference to the child.  Now with both
parent and child gone there are no references left to the ''common''
object so it will be disposed of as well.  All the reference counting
and disposal takes place automatically as part of Visual Basic's
internal behaviour, no code needs to be written to make it happen, you
just have to set up the structures correctly.

Note that the parent can have as many children as you like, held in a
collection or array of object references for instance.

A common use for this sort of structure occurs when the child needs to
combine some information about the parent with some of its own.  For
instance, if you are modelling some complicated machine and want each
part to have a property showing its position.  You would like to avoid
making this a simple read write property because then you have to
explicitly update that property on each object when the machine as a
whole moves.  Much better to make it a calculated property based on
the parent position and some dimensional properties then when the
parent is moved all the calculated properties will be correct without
running any extra code.  Another application is a property that returns
a fully qualified path from  root object to the child. 

Here is a code example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  'cParent
  Private moChildren as Collection
  Private moCommon as cCommon
  
  Private Sub Class_Initialize()
    Set moChildren = New Collection
    Set moCommon = New cCommon
  End Sub
  
  Public Function NewChild as cChild
    Set NewChild = New cChild
    Set NewChild.oCommon = moCommon    
    moChildren.Add newChild
  End Function

  'cCommon
  Public sName As String

  'cChild
  Private moCommon As cCommon
  Public Name as String
  
  Public Property Set oCommon(RHS as cCommon)
    Set moCommon = RHS
  End Property
  
  Public Property Get Path() as String
    Path = moCommon.Name &amp; &quot;/&quot; &amp; Name
  End Property
&lt;/source&gt;

As it stands that really only works for one level of parent child
relations, but often we have an indefinite number of levels, for
instance in a disk directory structure.

We can generalise this by recognizing that parents and children can
actually be the same class and that the child doesn't care how the
parent path is determined so long as it comes from the common object. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  'cFolder
  Private moChildren as Collection
  Private moCommon as cCommon
  
  Private Sub Class_Initialize()
    Set moChildren = New Collection
    Set moCommon = New cCommon
  End Sub
  
  Public Function NewFolder as cFolder
    Set NewFolder = New cFolder
    Set NewFolder.oCommon = moCommon    
    moChildren.Add newFolder
  End Function
  
  Public Property Set oCommon(RHS as cCommon)
    Set moCommon.oCommon = RHS
  End Property
  
  Public Property Get Path() as String
    Path = moCommon.Path
  End Property
  
  Public Property Get Name() as String 
    Name= moCommon.Name
  End Property 
  
  Public Property Let Name(RHS As String) 
    moCommon.Name = RHS
  End Property 

  'cCommon
  Private moCommon As cCommon
  Public Name As String
  
  Public Property Get Path() as String
    Path = &quot;/&quot; &amp; Name 
    if not moCommon is Nothing then 
      ' has parent
      Path = moCommon.Path &amp; Path 
    End If
  End Property
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we can ask any object at any level of the structure for its full
path and it will return it without needing a reference to its parent.

=== Exercises ===
*Create a simple program using the cfolder and cCommon classes and show that it works; that is, that it neither leaks memory nor gives the wrong answers for the ''Path'' property.

== Errors and Exceptions ==

Before discussing the various kinds of errors we'll show how errors are handled in Visual Basic.

Visual Basic does not have exception classes, instead it has the older
system of error codes.  While this does make some kinds of
programming awkward it really doesn't cause all that much trouble in
well written programs.  If your program doesn't rely on handling
exceptions during normal operations you won't have much use for
exception classes anyway.  

However if you are part of a team that is creating a large program that consists of a large number of components (COM DLLs) it can be difficult to keep lists of error codes synchronized.  One solution is to maintain a master list that is used by everyone in the project, another is to use exception classes after all.  See [http://www.kellyethridge.com/vbcorlib/index.shtml VBCorLib] for an implementation in pure VB6 of many of the classes in the mscorlib.dll that provides the basis for programs created for Microsoft's .NET architecture.

There are two statements in Visual Basic that implement the error
handling system:

*On Error Goto
*Err.Raise

The usual way of dealing with errors is to place an ''On Error Goto''
statement at the top of a procedure as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;On Error Goto EH&lt;/source&gt;

''EH'' is a label at the end of the procedure.  Following the label
you place code that deals with the error.  Here is a typical ''error
handler'': 

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    Exit Sub
  EH:
    If Err.Number = 5 Then
      FixTheProblem
      Resume
    End If
    Err.Raise Err.Number
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

There are several important things to notice about this:

*There is an ''Exit Sub'' statement immediately preceding the ''error handler'' label to ensure that when no error occurs the program does not fall into the ''error handler''.
*The error code is compared to a constant and action taken depending on the result,
*The last statement ''re-raises'' the error in case there was no explicit handler,
*A resume statement is included to continue execution at the failed statement. 

It might be that this is a perfectly useable handler for some
procedure but it has some weak points:

*Use of a literal constant,
*The catch all ''Err.Raise'' statement doesn't provide any useful information, it just passes on the bare error code,
*''Resume'' re-executes the failed statement.

There is no reason to ever use literal constants in any program.
Always declare them either as individual constants or as enumerations.  Error codes are best declared as enumerations like
this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Enum ErrorCodes
    dummy = vbObjectError + 1
    MyErrorCode
  End Enum
&lt;/source&gt;

When you want a new error code you just add it to the list.  The codes
will be assigned in increasing order.  In fact you really never need
to care what the actual number is.

You can declare the built in error codes in the just the same way
except that you must explicitly set the values:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Enum vbErrorCodes
    InvalidProcedureCall = 5
  End Enum
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Taxonomy of Errors ===
There are broadly three kinds of errors:

;Expected:Expected errors occur when the user or other external entity provides data that is clearly invalid.  In such cases the user, whether a human or another program, must be informed about the error in the data not about where in the program it was discovered.
;Failure to abide by the contract:a caller fails to supply valid arguments to a subroutine or a subroutine fails to provide a valid return value.
;Unexpected:an error occurs that was not predicted by the specification of the program.

Expected errors are not really errors in the program but errors or inconsistencies in the data presented to the program.  The program can must request that the user fix the data and retry the operation.  In such cases the user has no use for a stack trace or other internal arcana but has a considerable interest in clear and full description of the problem in external terms.  The error report should point the user directly at the problem in the data and offer suggestions for fixing it.  Don't just say &quot;Invalid Data&quot;, say which piece of data is invalid, why it is invalid and what range of values can be accepted.  

Contract failures usually indicate logic errors in the code.  On the assumption that all the invalid data has been weeded out by the front end the program must work unless the program itself is faulty.  See the [[#Assertions and Design By Contract]] for more information on this topic.

Unexpected errors are the errors that most programmers concentrate on.  In fact they are not terribly common, they only appear so because the contract between the various parts of the program is rarely spelled out.  ''Unexpected'' errors differ from ''Expected'' errors in that the user cannot usually be expected to assist in immediate recovery from unexpected errors.  The program then needs to present the user with all the gory details of the internal state of the program at the time that the error was discovered in a form that can easily be transmitted back to the maintainers of the program.  A log file is ideal for this purpose.  Don't just present the user with a standard message box because there is no practical way to capture the description so that it can be emailed to the maintainers.

=== Error Raising and Handling ===

==== Expected Errors ====

These are errors in the input data.  From the point of view of the program they are not exceptions.  The program should explicitly check for valid input data and explicitly inform the user when the data is invalid.  Such checks belong in user interfaces or other parts of the program that are able to interact directly with the user.  If the user interface is unable to perform the checks itself then the lower level components must provide methods that validate the data so that the user interface can make use of them.  The method used to notify the user should depend on the severity and immediacy of the error as well as the general method of working with the program.  For instance a source code editor can flag syntax errors without disturbing the creative flow of the user by highlighting the offending statements, the user can fix them at leisure.  In other cases a modal message box might be the correct means of notification.

==== Contract Errors ====

These failures are detected by asserting the truth of the
preconditions and postconditions of a procedure either by using the
assertion statement or by raising an error if the conditions are not
met.  Such errors normally indicate faulty program logic and when they
occur the report must sufficient information to enable the problem to
be replicated.  The report can easily be quite explicit about the
immediate cause of the failure.  When using Visual Basic it is
important to remember that Debug.Assert statements are only executed
in the IDE so it can be worthwhile raising erors instead in all but
the most time critical routines.

Here is a simple, too simple, example of contract assertions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Sub Reciprocal(n as Double) as Double
    Debug.Assert 0 &lt;&gt; n
    Reciprocal = 1 / n
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Visual basic will halt on the assertion of ''n = 0'' so if you run
your tests in the IDE you will be taken directly to the spot where the
error is discovered.

==== Unexpected Errors ====

These are errors that are not caught by either validation of input
data nor assertion of the truth of preconditions or postconditions.
Like contract errors they indicate faulty logic in the program; of
course the logic error can be in the validation of the input data or
even in one of the preconditions or postconditions.

These errors need the most thorough report because they are obviously
unusual and difficult or they would have been forseen in the
validation and contract checks.  Like contract failures the report
should be logged to a text file so that it can easily be sent to the
maintainers.  Unlike the contract failures it won't be easy to tell
what information is relevant so err on the safe side by including
descriptions of all the arguments to the subroutines in the ''Err.Raise''
statements.

== Similar projects ==

How does this relate to [http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page the psychology WIKI project], which also claims to be a psychology textbook type resource...

: That wiki appears to have well developed articles, but doesn't put them into a format that would make it easy to learn what needs to be learned first.  I did ask if I can import some of their information, and am waiting for a reply. [[User:ArrowStomper|ArrowStomper]] 12:27, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

==Page Renaming==
I saw that these pages do need to be renamed but am unsure of how to go about it.  Should I make a new chapter one with the correct page name and then copy the information from the old chapter one into the new one?  I also have a class in wikiversity that I am linking to this book for the reading material and then having the tests in wikiversity, if I rename the pages it will make all of those links inoperable.

==Transclusion proposal==

i am developing the animal behavior [[Animal Behavior]] text and i am proposing to easy into the section on neuroscience by building on the same section that already exists in the introduction to psychology book. the goal is to continue fleshing it out jointly. once much of the basic material is there i would fork a copy back into the animal behavior book.

It seems like it has been quite a while since this project has moved forward.  I am looking for a platform for an epub style book that I can use with my students (technical/community college).  Unless someone has an idea for another project that may be further along, I intend to jump in here and see what we can do!

--

All the cookbooks I have and recipes I've tried rely on the oven being very very hot - so I'm editing and putting 'as hot as your oven will go' - my oven goes to about 240 degrees Centigrade and that seems to work! [[User:TheMoog|TheMoog]] 14:35, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

== yogurt? ==

Does the yogurt go into the naan, as well?

In my experience, yes it does. A lot of Indian cuisine uses yogurt from goats.
[[User:209.60.60.197|209.60.60.197]] 20:15, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

== Yum! ==

I just wanted to say that I tried this recipe today, and it made some '''awesome''' naan!  As for the temperature, I cranked up my oven somewhere around 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 C) and it turned out great.  I actually forgot to brush it with butter, but I like it that way.  --[[User:Timc|Timc]] 03:46, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

==how long in the oven? ==
I am curious to try this, but how long should the naan be in the oven? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:132.206.72.82|132.206.72.82]] ([[User talk:132.206.72.82|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/132.206.72.82|contribs]]) 2007-02-20T07:26:25.&lt;/small&gt;

:&quot;Until done&quot;! No, really, until they puff up a little and look cooked. In a really hot oven, this should only be about 4-5 minutes. (I'll adjust the recipe accordingly, thanks for prompting!) [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:08, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

== Pretty good ==

I've also had success with this recipe, although I could have done with an oven that'd go hotter (230&amp;deg;C was barely hot enough - took 10 mins at this temp). I've added a note to say how many naan breads the quantities of ingredients given will make.

== Sufficient water? ==
How much is sufficient?  It's approximate of course but dough recipes should always contain an estimate of the amount required.  I got pretty good results when making the recipe halved, using 1/2 cup of water, it ended up a little too wet so I'd guess 3/4 cup of water would be about right for the unhalved recipe. - anon

==yeast==

My family makes this with yeast, is there a yeast variation of this recipe?

(sorry, I just saw the variation in the page), ignore this comment,.</text>

      <comment>/* Plurals */ finalize addition of span titles</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Since Japanese nouns (名詞; &lt;span title=&quot;meishi&quot;&gt;めいし&lt;/span&gt;) don't inflect they are fairly simple to master. They do, however, take particles to indicate their place in sentences.

Some commonly used particles for nouns are: &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;wa&quot;&gt;は&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Note that when &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;ha&quot;&gt;は&lt;/span&gt;&quot; is a particle, it is always pronounced as &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;wa&quot;&gt;わ&lt;/span&gt;&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;, &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;ga&quot;&gt;が&lt;/span&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;o&quot;&gt;を&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The syllable &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;o&quot;&gt;を&lt;/span&gt;&quot; only exists as a particle. It is pronounced ''&lt;span title=&quot;o&quot;&gt;お&lt;/span&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt;.
{{TOC|float=right}}
== Plurals ==
The Japanese language lacks plurals in the normal English sense. Plural words are usually either preceded with a number and a [[../Counters|counter]], or simply made understood through context.

A few nouns can also suffix a pluralizing word, such as &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;tachi&quot;&gt;たち&lt;/span&gt;&quot; or &quot;ら&quot; (e.g. &lt;span title=&quot;hoshitachi&quot;&gt;ほしたち&lt;/span&gt; meaning stars). When referring to a person, &quot;&lt;span title=&quot;tachi&quot;&gt;たち&lt;/span&gt;&quot; indicates company.  For example, &lt;span title=&quot;megumitachi&quot;&gt;めぐみたち&lt;/span&gt; can mean &quot;Megumi and friends&quot;.

Yet others indicate plurality by repetition (e.g.,  &lt;span title=&quot;hito&quot;&gt;ひと&lt;/span&gt; means person and &lt;span title=&quot;hitobito&quot;&gt;ひとびと&lt;/span&gt; means persons.) Written in kanji, the repetition mark, 々, is used (e.g., &lt;span title=&quot;hito&quot;&gt;人&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span title=&quot;hitobito&quot;&gt;人々&lt;/span&gt;).

== Noun-phrase particles ==
{{See also|Japanese/Grammar/Basic Particles}}

Japanese word structure, unlike Western languages which allow declensions depending on gender, tense, and many other aspects, maintains constant word forms, which are inflected by particles.

Note that particles always follow the nouns that they mark.

There are a couple of templates displayed on this page.
[[Template:Notice Proofread]] and [[Template:Wikijunior_Solar_System_coolfacts]].
Template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikijunior_Solar_System_coolfacts}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; takes 3 arguments -- an image, a title, and the facts text.
It is meant for use in the Wikijunior Solar System article, but
it could be used anywhere.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Visual Basic is Microsoft's high-level object-oriented [[w:rapid application development|rapid application development]] environment for the Windows platform. The first versions of Visual Basic were intended to target Windows 3.0 (a version for DOS existed as well), however it was not until version 3.0 for Windows 3.1 that this programming language gained large-scale acceptance in the shareware and corporate programming community.

Using drawing tools that resemble those found in hardcopy page layout programs or PhotoShop, VB programmers make user interfaces by drawing controls and other UI components onto forms. The programmer then adds code to respond to user interactions with the controls (for example, clicks, drag and drop, etc) known as events.  The code can trigger events in other controls (for example, by displaying text or an image), execute procedures (run some algorithm based on the values entered in some control, output data, do business logic, etc), or almost anything else one might do in code.

Visual Basic can be considered to be an interpreted language like its [[Subject:BASIC programming language|Basic]] ancestor, with appropriate modifications to accommodate [[Object Oriented Programming|object-oriented programming]], and has implicit type conversion. That is, the VB development environment goes to great lengths to format (and aid the user in formatting) programming code so that it conforms to executable syntax. For example, VB will appropriately change the case of newly typed variable names to match those that have been declared previously (if they have been declared at all!). Traditionally, VB is known for compiling programs into pseudo-code (p-code, similar to Java's byte code) which is interpreted at runtime, requiring the use of dynamically-linked libraries (for example, VBRUN300.DLL for version 3 of Visual Basic, circa 1992) but newer versions can compile code into something more closely resembling the efficient machine code generated by C-like compilers.  VB6 can be compile either into p-code or into native code; in fact VB6 uses the Microsoft C++ compiler to generate the executable.

For new Windows programmers, VB offers the advantage of being able to access much of the Windows UI functionality without knowing much about how it works by hiding the technical details. Although accessing low-level Windows UI functionality is possible, doing so in VB is as, or more difficult compared to such access using Visual C++ or other lower level programming languages. Recently [[Visual Basic .NET|VB.NET]] has gone a long way to fixing some of the limitations.

Using custom controls provided by Microsoft or third parties, almost any functionality that is possible in Windows can be added to a VB program by drawing a custom control onto a form in the project.

Visual Basic traditionally comes in at least entry level and professional versions, with various designations depending on Microsoft's contemporary marketing strategy. The different versions are generally differentiated by the number of custom controls included, and the capabilities of the compiler. Higher priced packages include more functionality.

==Evolution of Visual Basic==
VB 1.0 was introduced in [[w:1991|1991]]. The approach for connecting the programming language to the graphical user interface is derived from a system called ''Tripod'' (sometimes also known as ''Ruby''), originally developed by [[w:Alan Cooper|Alan Cooper]], which was further developed by Cooper and his associates under contract to Microsoft.

==Timeline of Visual Basic==
* Visual Basic 1.0 (May 1991) was released for Windows.

* Visual Basic 1.0 for DOS was released in September 1992. The language itself was not quite compatible with Visual Basic for Windows, as it was actually the next version of Microsoft's DOS-based BASIC compilers, Microsoft QuickBASIC compiler QuickBASIC and BASIC Professional Development System. The interface was barely graphical, using extended ASCII characters to simulate the appearance of a GUI. 

* Visual Basic 2.0 was released in November 1992. The programming environment was easier to use, and its speed was improved.

* Visual Basic 3.0 was released in the summer of 1993 and came in Standard and Professional versions. VB3 included a database engine that could read and write Access databases.

* Visual Basic 4.0 (August 1995) was the first version that could create 32-bit as well as 16-bit Windows programs. It also introduced the ability to write classes in Visual Basic.

* With version 5.0 (February 1997), Microsoft released Visual Basic exclusively for 32-bit versions of Windows. Programmers who preferred to write 16-bit programs were able to import programs written in Visual Basic 4.0 to Visual Basic 5.0, and Visual Basic 5.0 programs can easily be converted with Visual Basic 4.0.  Visual Basic 5.0 also introduced the ability to create custom user controls, as well as the ability to compile to native Windows executable code, speeding up runtime code execution. 

* Visual Basic 6.0 (Mid 1998) improved in a number of areas, including the ability to create web-based applications using Internet Explorer. Visual Basic 6 is no longer supported.

How about just reviewing-and-correcting [[Talk:Wikijunior_Solar_System#wrt_the_space_exploration_section| The part you showed interest in]]? If you could add a citation for your source, that would demonstrate that the fact has already been checked (just leave the reference in-line if you like -- we can clean it up later).

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mark Lewis. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mark Lewis~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''Fleischbutter''' (meat butter) is a combination of ground meat, butter, and spices, used as a [[Cookbook:Spreads|spread]].  Fleischbutter is popular in some German regions (south-west), and either unknown or considered inedible in others (north/east). The most common form of fleischbutter is made with ground pork; variants use beef, lamb, kidney, tripe, and other muscle and organ meats.  Spices also vary considerably.  

A restaurant's breakfast spread might include three or four selections of fleischbutter in small containers, along with containers of butter and jam and chocolate-spread.

      <text xml:space="preserve">See [http://www.angebrannt.de/kochrezept_Sonstiges-Party-Fleischbutter_18406.html angebrannt.de]'s recipe, care of Maria Schramm.

&lt;!-- translation:
Serves 1

Ingredients:
* 500 g roasted pork 
* 250 g roasted beef ('gebraten evtl. Bratenreste')
* 150 g ham
* 20 g capers
* 1 sm onion
* 200 g soft butter 
* 2 El. mustard
* 1 Tl. anchovy paste
* 3 El. cream
* Salt and pepper to taste

The roasted pork, beef, ham, capers, and onion should be turned together by the Fleischwolf.

The butter together with the mustard, cream, and anchovy paste should be well-mixed with the meat.  Let it sit for 1/2 hour and then season with salt, pepper and Sardellenpaste.

Tastes good on dark bread or baguette, as well as for a party.

:This is very probably the only occurrence of this recipe, so everything the article says about its being popular in parts of Germany and included in hotel breakfasts is totally wrong. ''Fleischbutter'' is completely unknown in Germany; no German dictionary or printed cookbook I know of lists the term. The reference to www.uni-tuebingen.de above is a simple misunderstanding; in the German text an &quot;und&quot; (and) between ''Fleisch'' and ''Butter'' is missing in a sentence about substandard supply of meat and butter in Nazi Germany. --[[User:Jossi2|Jossi2]] ([[User talk:Jossi2|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jossi2|contribs]]) 22:46, 8 November 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* か (interrogative) */ questions normally use polite form</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The ''sentence ending particles'' (終助詞, しゅうじょし) are placed, unsurprisingly, at the end of sentences and apply to it as a whole. These include for example the question marker, か, and a host of others that express the speaker's emotions. Those emotion-indicating particles don't have any grammatical meaning, and, thus, used mostly in speech.

== か (interrogative) ==
Question mark, used to indicate the sentence is a question. Note that か replaces だ instead of appearing after it, so you can either omit the copula at all, or use a full form (で ある). 

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | あのひと は だれ です か？ || Who is that man?
|-
| たなかさん は せんせい です か？ || Is Mr. Tanaka a teacher?
|}
The particle may also follow question pronouns with the meaning of ''some'' as in ''someone'':
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | だれ か || somebody
|-
| どこ か || somewhere
|}

== の (emphatic interrogative) ==
An emphatic question mark:
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | いい の？ || Is it okay?
|-
| どこに行くの? || Where are we going?
|}

== ね (emphasis and confirmation) ==
Polite and expresses
* the speaker's desire to receive confirmation (rising intonation), or
* the speaker's agreement (falling intonation).
Often translated as &quot;isn't it so&quot;, &quot;don't you think so&quot; or &quot;don't you agree with me&quot;. Also used as a polite or friendly sentence ending. Some people end virtually every sentence with &quot;ね&quot;.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | それ は むずかしい ね。↑ || It's difficult, isn't it?
|-
| それ は むずかしい ね。↓ || That sure is difficult.
|-
| たなかさん は すごい ひと だ ね...↓ || Mr. Tanaka is a great guy...
|}
Also works as &quot;phrase softener&quot;, i.e., it makes the phrase sound softer. Lengthening the syllable makes it more emphatic. The lengthening is usually indicated with a tilde:
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | きれい だ ね~↓ || It's so beautiful!
|}

== よ (emphasis) ==
Used when providing new information with emphasis, or like an exclamation mark, especially for commands:
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | わかる よ || I understand.
|}

== ぞ (emphasis) ==
Similar to よ but more masculine.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | いく ぞ || I'm going.
|}

== な (opinion) ==
Informal, used when emphasizing an opinion. Male speakers tend to prefer using &quot;な&quot; instead of &quot;ね&quot;.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | たなか は ばか だ な... || Tanaka's a fool...
|-
| さむい なあ || It's so cold.
|}
なあ also has other, polite, uses (to express deep thinking or rhetoric questions)

== な (prohibition) ==
な can indicate prohibition when placed after verbs. In direct speech, this sounds rude and angry.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | いく な！ || Don't go!
|-
| みる な！ || Don't look!
|}

== かな, かしら (uncertainty) ==
Indicate that speaker is not sure about something. かしら is used mostly by women.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | どこ に ある の かな || I wonder, where was it?
|}

== ぜ (agreement) ==
Expresses agreement, used only by men in conversations &lt;!-- with people whose social status is below the speaker's--&gt;. Also sometimes used as a vulgar よ.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | おい、にげる ぜ || Hey, I'm getting out of here!
|}

== わ (agreement) ==
Like よ but softer. Used by women, but also by men in some parts of Japan.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | あした行くわ。 || I will go tomorrow.
|}

== さ (emphasis) ==
Filler particle, used to emphasize the sentence (unlike よ, not implying any command or new information is communicated):
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:18em&quot; | あの　さ || hey
|}

&lt;big&gt;'''Tumors of the Salivary Glands'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*Median age for salivary gland malignancy is 55-65.
*Median age for benign salivary gland tumor is 10 yrs younger.
*Salivary gland malignancies represent 3-6% of head and neck cancers.
*Tumor distribution (Perez 5th edition):
**Parotid gland 70%
**Submandibular gland 8%
**Minor salivary glands 22%


==Histology==
*75% of parotid masses are benign
*Low grade tumors of the parotid:  acinic cell, low grade mucoepidermoid
*High grade tumors of the parotid:  high grade mucoepidermoid, adenoid cystic, adenoCA, squamous cell
*Most common histology of malignant parotid gland tumor is mucoepidermoid (30%).
*Predominant histology of a malignant submandibular gland tumor is adenoid cystic.
*Histologic classification is often difficult, with significant interobserver variability and reclassification rate

==Anatomy==
'''Salivary Glands:'''
*&lt;u&gt;Parotid&lt;/u&gt; - superficial to and behind ramus of the mandible. LN drainage to parotid nodes, and then to superficial LNs along SCM muscle and to deep cervical chain
*&lt;u&gt;Submandibular&lt;/u&gt; - in triangle between digastric muscle bellies and lower border of the mandible. LN drainage to both submandibular LNs and directly to anterior subdigastic LNs
*&lt;u&gt;Sublingual&lt;/u&gt; - medial to mandible, lateral to genioglossus muscle of the tongue, superior to mylohyoid muscle, inferior to mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. LN drainage to submandibular LNs or to deep internal jugular chain
*&lt;u&gt;Minor Salivary Glands&lt;/u&gt; - widely distributed throughout the upper aerodigestive tract (see below)


'''Parotid Gland'''
*Anatomical borders of parotid gland
**Superior - zygomatic arch
**Inferior - upper border of posterior belly of digastric
**Anterior - 2nd maxillary molar
**Posterior - tip of mastoid
*Lobes of parotid gland:
**Parotid gland divided into superficial and deep lobes.  
**Lobes of parotid separated by relation to facial nerve (no fascial plane separating them).


'''Nodal drainage of Salivary Glands:'''
*Parotid:
**Periparotid and intraparotid nodes
**Level I, Level II, Level III
*Submandibular
**Level I, Level II, Level III


'''Contouring / Anatomy'''
*See [[Radiation Oncology/Head &amp; Neck/Anatomy#Specific sites|Radiation Oncology/Head &amp; Neck/Anatomy]] (e.g. COSTAR trial)

==Staging==
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)'''&lt;br&gt;
''Tumor''
*T1 - 2cm or less w/o extraparenchymal extension
*T2 - &gt;2cm but not greater than 4cm; and w/o extraparenchymal extension
*T3 - &gt;4cm or with extraparenchymal extension
*T4a - invades skin, mandible, ear canal or facial nerve
*T4b - invades skull base, pterygoid plates or encases carotid


''Nodes'' (same as for most H&amp;N sites){{:Radiation Oncology/Head &amp; Neck/Node staging}}


''Overall stage''
*I - T1 N0
*II - T2 N0
*III - T3 N0-1, or T1-3 N1 (i.e. T3 or N1)
*IVA - T4a N0-2, or T1-4a N2 (i.e. T4a or N2)
*IVB - T4b N0-3, or T1-4b N3 (i.e. T4b or N3)
*IVC - M1

===Older staging systems===
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)'''&lt;br&gt;
No changes compared to 7th edition

==Treatment==
*Treatment of choice for malignancy of salivary glands is surgical resection.
**Superficial parotidectomy if possible for parotid malignancy
**Total parotidectomy indicated if tumor invades into or adjacent to deep lobe.  Total parotidectomy still attempts to spare CNVII.
**Facial nerve should be sacrificed if invasion of CNVII or facial palsy
*Indications for adjuvant RT typically includes positive margins, invasion outside of salivary gland, positive nodes, high grade histology
**Treatment volume: No need for contralateral neck treatment even with positive ipsilateral neck nodes (see Harrison, 1990). Treat parotid bed only for low grade cancers with indications for local irradiation but no lymph node involvement.  Treat parotid bed and ipsilateral neck for high grade cancers, recurrent cancers, or LN metastases.  
**Radiation dose: Tumor bed - 60 Gy at 2 Gy/fx or 63 Gy at 1.8 Gy/fx.  Positive margins - 66-70 Gy.  Neck (undissected) - 50-54 Gy.  Neck (dissected) - 60-63 Gy
*Neutrons are superior to photon RT based on a randomized RTOG-MRC trial; local control was dramatically better but so was the rate of severe late effects. Neutron therapy is not routinely available, and not actively pursued  

===Adjuvant Radiation===
*'''Dutch Head and Neck Oncology Cooperative Group (NWHHT), 2005''' PMID 15629600 -- Terhaard CHJ et al.  &quot;The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of malignant salivary gland tumors,&quot;  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Jan 1;61(1):103-11.
**Largest series published for malignant salivary gland tumors.
**498 pts w/ malignant primary salivary gland carcinoma.  Of pts treated w/ surgery, 78% received adjuvant xrt (median dose 62 Gy)
**Factors in which adjuvant radiation significantly improved local control included T3-T4, close margin, incomplete resection, bony invasion, and PNI.
**Local control for surgery alone if T1-2 and clear margins was 95% at 5 yrs, and 90% at 10 yrs
**5yr local control if definitive xrt was 50% if 66-70 Gy delivered.

*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering''' 
*PMID 2166187, 1990 -- &quot;Postoperative radiation therapy for major salivary gland malignancies.&quot; Harrison L et al. J Surg Oncol. 1990 Sep;45(1):52-5.

*PMID 2306346, 1990 (1966-82) &amp;mdash; &quot;Malignant tumors of major salivary gland origin. A matched-pair analysis of the role of combined surgery and postoperative radiotherapy.&quot; Armstrong JG et al. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1990 Mar;116(3):290-3. 
**Matched pair analysis of patients with combined surgery + post-op RT and pts treated with surgery alone (1939-65).
**5-year survival for Stage I-II 81.9% (S+RT) vs 95.8% (S), and for Stage III-IV 51.3% vs 16.8%.  For LN+ 48.9% vs 18.7%.  
**Conclusion: post-op RT improves survival for Stage III-IV and LN+.

*'''Johns Hopkins, 1990''' (1975-87) PMID 2115032 --  North CA et al.  &quot;Carcinoma of the major salivary glands treated by surgery or surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy,&quot; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 1990 Jun;18(6):1319-26. 
**87 pts w/ carcinoma of major salivary gland (70 parotid) tx'd w/ either surgery or surg + post-op RT (median 60 Gy).
**Factors associated w/ poor outcome included facial nerve paresis, undifferentiated histology, male sex, skin invasion, and no RT.
**Patients w/ local recurrence had major advantage if RT was given as part of salvage.

===Elective Nodal Irradiation===
*'''UCSF; 2007''' (1960-2004) PMID 17234357 -- &quot;Patterns of nodal relapse after surgery and postoperative radiation therapy for carcinomas of the major and minor salivary glands: what is the role of elective neck irradiation?&quot;  (Chen AM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Mar 15;67(4):988-94.)
**Retrospective. 251 patients, N0 salivary gland malignancy (adenoid cystic 33%, mucoepidermoid 24%, adenoCA 23%), gross total resection (R0 44%, R1 56%), no LND + RT. Median primary RT dose 63 Gy. 52% had elective neck irradiation (ipsilateral neck 69%, bilateral 31%) 
**10-year outcome: Nodal failures in T1 7%, T2 5%, T3 12%, T4 16%. 
**ENI reduced 10-yr nodal relapse from 26% to 0%, especially in squamous cell (67%), undifferentiated CA (50%), adenoCA (34%). No nodal failures in adenoid cystic CA (0/84) or acinic cell (0/21), regardless of ENI.
**Conclusion: ENI effectively prevents nodal relapses

*'''Memorial Sloan Kettering, 1992''' - PMID 1730113, (1939-82)  Armstrong JG et al.  &quot;The indications for elective treatment of the neck in cancer of the major salivary glands.&quot; Cancer. 1992 Feb 1;69(3):615-9. 
**474 pts. Clinically LN+ in 14%. Pathologically positive (occult) LN mets in 12% of those with clinically negative neck. 
**Size and grade were predictive of LN mets. Size: 20% (&gt;4 cm) vs 4%; Grade: 49% (High grade) vs 7% (int or low grade).

===Definitive Radiation Therapy===
*'''UCSF, 2006''' (1960-2004) PMID 16965870 -- Chen AM et al.  &quot;Long-term outcome of patients treated by radiation therapy alone for salivary gland carcinomas.&quot; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Nov 15;66(4):1044-50.
**45 pts w/ newly dx'd salivary gland carcinoma tx'd w/ definitive xrt to median dose of 66 Gy.
**5 yr estimated local control was 70%, 10 yr 57%
**T3-4 disease and &lt;66 Gy were predictors for local recurrence.
*'''Gainesville, 2005''' (1964-2003) PMID 15880750 -- Mendenhall WM et al.  &quot;Radiotherapy alone or combined with surgery for salivary gland carcinoma.&quot;  Cancer. 2005 Jun 15;103(12):2544-50.
**Retrospective review of pts at U of FL tx'd w/ curative intent w/ RT alone (64) vs surg (160).
**T stage and use of surgery were predictors of local control.
**RT cured approximately 20% of advanced stage tumors if used alone.

===Neutron Therapy===
*'''RTOG-MRC Neutron Trial''' -- neutrons vs. photons/electrons
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to neutron advantage.'' 32 patients, inoperable or recurrent major or minor salivary gland tumors. Arm 1) Neutrons (17-22 nGy) vs. Arm 2) photon/electrons (55 Gy/4 weeks or 70 Gy/7.5 weeks)
**'''2-years; 1988''' PMID 2846479 -- &quot;Neutron vs photon irradiation of inoperable salivary gland tumors: results of an RTOG-MRC Cooperative Randomized Study.&quot; (Griffin TW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1988 Nov;15(5):1085-90.) Minimum F/U 2 years
***Outcome: 2-year LRC neutrons 67% vs. photons/electrons 17% (SS); 2-year OS 62% vs. 25% (NS)
***Conclusion: Neutrons superior for local control, but no impact on survival
**'''Final; 1993''' PMID 8407397 -- &quot;Neutron versus photon irradiation for unresectable salivary gland tumors: final report of an RTOG-MRC randomized clinical trial.&quot;  (Laramore G, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Sep 30;27(2):235-40)
***Outcome: 10-year LRC neutrons 56% vs. photons/electrons 17% (SS); OS 25% vs. 15% (NS). Median OS 3 years vs. 1.2 years
***Toxicity: Severe toxicity worse in neutron arm, but no difference in &quot;life-threatening&quot; complications
***Conclusion: Fast neutron RT appears to be the treatment of choice for patients with inoperable/recurrent salivary gland tumors
**Comment: Remains as only randomized trial for malignant salivary gland tumors

*'''University of Washington, 2003''' PMID 12975266 -- Douglas JG et al.  &quot;Treatment of salivary gland neoplasms with fast neutron radiotherapy.&quot;  Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 2003 Sep;129(9):944-8. 
**279 pts tx'd w/ curative intent using fast neutron therapy (263 had evidence of gross residual dz).
**Multivariate analysis showed improved CSS for pts w/ stage I-II dz, lack of skull base invasion, minor salivary site.

==Minor Salivary Glands==
*Widely distributed throughout the upper aerodigestive tract: tumors present in 38% palate, 12% cheek/lips, 12% antrum, 10% tongue, 10% nasal cavity, multiple other sites &lt;10%
*Imaging depends on location, but should involve evaluation of bone involvement
*Definitive diagnosis should be via excisional biopsy
*Histology: 40% adenoid cystic, 16% mucoepidermoid, 16% adenoCA, 28% others
*Prognosis: worst for adenoid cystic
*General management (based on Perez 5th edition)
**Depending on site, attempt surgical resection (though not simple excision, as significant residual disease can be left behind)
**Radiation may be used as adjuvant or primary, with techniques similar to squamous cell cancers in the same location, except:
***Adenoid cystic involving a named branch of cranial nerve, in which case nerve path to skull base should be treated. For focal perineural invasion, treatment to skull base should be based on anatomic location
***For paranasal sinuses or palate, base of skull should be treated due to proximity
***Fields may not need to electively include LNs, except if located in tongue, floor of mouth, pharynx, or larnyx and neck was not dissected. However, UCSF data on elective nodal irradiation (ENI) above suggest no benefit for adenoid cystic or acinic cell
**RT dose
***Negative margins: 60/30
***Microscopically positive margins: 66/33
***Grossly residual disease or primary treatment: 70/35

**Retrospective. 55 patients with minor salivary gland cancer. Median F/U for alive patients 11.1 years
**Outcome: 5-year DSS 76%, 10-year DSS 74%
**Prognostic factors: younger age, lower AJCC stage, LN+, vascular invasion, nasopharynx/paranasal sinus location
**Conclusion: comparable outcome to major salivary gland patients


==Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma==
===Overview===
*First described in 1853, named adenoid cystic in 1953
*Slow-growing epithelial tumor of salivary glands, thought to arise from intercalated mucous-secreting ducts. Can arise anywhere within the upper respiratory tract
*Predominance in 5th-6th decade, and in females
*Estimated 5-10% of all salivary tumors, but common in minor salivary glands (30-40%). Parotid gland is the single most common site, and accounts for ~25%. Minor salivary glands account for ~60% in total; most common site is palate
*Histologically shows 3 patterns: glandular, tubular, and solid (worse prognosis)
*Characterized by persistent local recurrences, perineural spread, and distant metastases; lymphatic spread less common
*Distant metastases may happen late, commonly affect lungs, are are frequently slow-growing and surgically resectable
*Most important prognostic factor is Stage; more favorable outcome of major parotid glands compared with minor is probably earlier diagnosis
*Overall, 5-year OS is exceptionally good but 10- and 20-year OS is exceptionally poor
*Most are treated surgically
*Role of adjuvant RT is controversial; some institutions use for all patients while others use for those with unfavorable features. It is probably reasonable to offer adjuvant radiation for most patients, especially with positive surgical margins or perineural invasion. RT dose should be &gt;60 Gy
*Perineural invasion of small unnamed nerves may not be correlated with worse control if treated with adjuvant RT; named branches of cranial nerves should probably be treated to skull base
*In patients with skull base extension (and likely R2 resection or unresectable), dose intensification with proton therapy or carbon ion boost appears superior to IMRT alone

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Psychology''' is an academic and applied field involving the study of behavior, mind and thought and the subconscious neurological bases of behavior. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness. It is largely concerned with humans, although the behavior and mental processes of animals can also be part of psychology research, either as a subject in its own right (e.g. animal cognition and ethology), or somewhat more controversially, as a way of gaining an insight into human psychology by means of comparison (including comparative psychology). '''Psychology is commonly defined as the science of behavior and mental processes.'''

Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system and can be framed purely in terms of phenomenological or information processing theories of mind. Increasingly, though, an understanding of brain function is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as artificial intelligence, neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience. 

The late 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study, because in that year German scientist '''Wilhelm Wundt''' founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research in Leipzig, Germany. 

Wundt is considered the father of Psychology. He pioneered the field with his historical approach of '''structuralism''' which attempted to understand the mind as the sum of varying underlying parts. Wundt collected data through the use of '''introspection''' with his subjects. He believed that the study of conscious thoughts would be the key to understand the mind.  This experimental introspection was in contrast to what had been called psychology until then, a branch of philosophy where people introspected themselves.

'''Introspection''' ''is the direct observation or rumination of one's own heart, mind and/or soul and its processes, as opposed to extrospection, the observation of things external to one's self.
''

'''Cognitive psychology''' accepts the use of the scientific method, but rejects introspection as a valid method of investigation. It should be noted that Herbert Simon and Allen Newell identified the 'thinking-aloud' protocol, in which investigators view a subject engaged in introspection, and who speaks his thoughts aloud, thus allowing study of his introspection.

Wundt argued that &quot;''we learn little about our minds from casual, haphazard self-observation...It is essential that observations be made by trained observers under carefully specified conditions for the purpose of answering a well-defined question.''&quot;

Many scientists criticized the idea of introspection as part of psychology because the observation of stimulation was speculative without an empirical approach and lacked objectivity. However the case, a new light to introspection has been created called '''Psychophysics'''. Psychophysics is the branch of psychology dealing with ''the relationship between physical stimuli and their perception''.

Other important early contributors to the field include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in studies on memory), the Russian Ivan Pavlov (who discovered the learning process of classical conditioning), and the Austrian Sigmund Freud.

The mid-20th century saw a rejection of Freud's theories among many psychologists as being too unscientific, as well as a reaction against Edward Titchener's abstract approach to the mind.

'''Edward B. Titchener''' (1876-1927) was an Englishman and a student of Wilhelm Wundt before becoming a professor of psychology at Cornell University. He would put his own spin on Wundt's psychology of consciousness after he emigrated to the United States.

At the turn of 19th century the founding father of experimental psychology Wilhelm Wundt tried to experimentally confirm his hypothesis that conscious mental life can be broken down into fundamental elements which then form more complex mental structures. Wundt's '''structuralism''' was quickly abandoned because it could not be tested in the same way as behavior, until now, when brain-scanning technology can identify, for example, specialized brain cells that respond exclusively to basic lines and shapes and are then combined in subsequent brain areas where more complex visual structures are formed. This line of research in modern psychology is called '''cognitive psychology''' rather than [[w:structuralism]] because Wundt's term never ceased to be associated with the problem of observability.

Structuralism could not survive the scrutiny of the scientific method, thus new approaches to studying the mind arose. One rather important historical approach was Functionalism. William James authored the book The Principles of Psychology which covered almost every topic that is now studied; learning, sensation, memory, reasoning, feelings, consciousness, and the revolutionary theory of emotions.

William James' approach to psychology was less concerned with the composition of the mind as Wilhelm Wundt wanted but rather to examine the ways the mind adapts to changing situations and environment. How for instance does one fear an a dangerous creature when they are running. Is the fear a product of the physiological changes that occur when a person notices a danger to himself? Or does the danger instigate the fear that causes the person to run away? These are topics that interested William James. Unfortunately Functionalism did not last as a unique approach but many of its elements have had great impact in other areas such as educational psychology.

Functionalism wasn't the only approach to develop during this time. A group of psychologists in Germany led by Max Wertheimer had been studying perceptions. One of their most famous experiments was to flash several light bulbs consecutively after one another to create a pattern of moving lights. Not much unlike how we see traffic signal that move in one direction. The bulbs them selves are not moving but they give the perception of movement. This early approach in studying patterns and perception was called the Gestalt approach literally meaning &quot;whole pattern&quot;. The Gestalt approach emphasized that perception is more than the sum of the parts and studied how sensations are assembled into meaning perceptual experiences. Many of the principles of the Gestalt approach are still used to explain how we perceive objects. 

No approach, though has lasted as a whole more than the Behavioral approach of John B. Watson. In his Book &quot;Psychology as a Behavioralist views it&quot; Watson rejected completely the technique of Wundt's structuralism and posed that the objective of psychology is to analyze observable behaviors to predict and control them. Behaviorism has been the dominant approach in psychology since the early 1900s and continues onto the present. 

The majority of mainstream psychology is based on a framework derived from '''cognitive psychology''', although the popularity of this paradigm does not exclude others, which are often applied as necessary. Psychologists specializing in certain areas, however, may use the dominant cognitive psychology only rarely if at all.

'''Cognitive psychology''' ''is the psychological science which studies cognition, the mental processes that are hypothesized to underlie behavior.'' This covers a broad range of research domains, examining questions about the workings of memory, attention, perception, knowledge representation, reasoning, creativity and problem solving.

Cognitive psychology is radically different from previous psychological approaches in two key ways.
* It accepts the use of the [[w:scientific method]], and generally rejects [[introspection]] as a valid method of investigation, unlike [[w:phenomenology|phenomenological]] methods such as [[w:Freud|Freudian]] psychology.
* It posits the existence of internal mental states (such as [[w:belief]]s, [[w:desire]]s and [[w:motivation]]s) unlike [[w:behaviorism|behaviorist]] psychology.

There were actually other socialists before Marx's book came out. That's where he got the examples I think.

In the Facism section of this book, it says: &quot;Racism plays a key part in Fascism, at least in National Socialism. It is based on the fact that others are sub-human and pose a threat to the majority's society in some way and therefore, they should be enslaved or destroyed. '''''This is very terrible thinking''''', but it was accepted because of the terrible economic conditions of the 1930s (Depression) and because logic could be used to explain.&quot;

This is very terrible thinking may be true, but it expresses an idea of the author and these are strictly non-fiction books. This should be changed immediatley.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Recipe Summary Template ==

I've created a [[Template:Recipe_Summary]] to produce the inset with servings, prep time, etc seen on many pages. This is modelled after the one on the dutch wikibooks ([[nl:Sjabloon:Recept]]). Its use is demonstrated on the [[Cookbook:Flaky Pie Crust]] page.

An example usage:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Recipe Summary|
|Name={{PAGENAME}}
|Category=Pastries
|Servings=1-2
|Calories=? Cal
|Time=prep: 30 minutes&lt;br/&gt;baking: 1 hour
|Difficulty=Medium, requires specific tools
|Rating=3
}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Usage notes:
* Usually this template should be the first thing on the page (before navigation).
* All fields shown here are required (otherwise you'll get template-looking output &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{blah}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;).
* The &quot;Category&quot; tries to resolve to an actual category.
* Rating is between 1 and 5 inclusive.

:Looks great. Now for the grunt work... --[[User:Bleh fu|bleh fu]] [[User talk:Bleh fu|&lt;small&gt;talk fu&lt;/small&gt;]] 4 July 2005 00:29 (UTC)

:One more usage note: I've used &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to expand the name of the article. For now this'll expand to &quot;Cookbook:Recipe Name&quot; but in the near future when &quot;Cookbook&quot; becomes a proper namespace on wikibooks it'll just expand to &quot;Recipe Name&quot;. This might even just get put in the template, but for now I wanted to leave the options open. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 4 July 2005 00:57 (UTC)

:I've created a shorthand template for this as well. See [[Cookbook:Policy]] for details. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:47, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

I've noticed a few pages have boxes like so:

{| width=200px border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f8ff&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em;&quot;

Though there don't seem to be very many active contributors at the moment (on vacation?) I wonder if people would like to try to categorize all the recipes with something more thorough like this. Well, do you? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:40, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

:I've been using the recipe summary, but I've got one improvement to suggest (see the sample template for the Desserts category, below). The energy value of food is currently called Calories, but this makes it difficult for people that use kilojoules for this measure. It's also like saying square footage when you really mean area, it's not really correct. I propose that the the section be changed to Energy, and that the units follow the quantity (e.g., kcal == Cal, kJ, etc.). I would also suggest that contributors follow their preferred unit with the corresponding one in the other system (in parentheses, like with ingredients). Note that 1 kcal = 4.186 kJ. ''(''&lt;sub&gt;Donovan&lt;/sub&gt;|[[User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|Interact]]&lt;/sup&gt;'')'' 00:51, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

{{recipesummary|Desserts|6|30-60 minutes|3|Medium difficulty|358-502 (1500-2100 kJ) per serving|Noincludecat=true}}
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both&quot;/&gt;

:: That's fair. I think maybe we should suggest an order though, calories first and kJ second? No preference with respect to the other fields in the example above? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:33, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:::We could use a consistent order. But, maybe it would be better to use the original units first, and the derived units second. That's how ingredient quantities are done at the moment, I think. Also by putting one before another, you open another kettle of fish, like favouring US English over commonwealth English (we don't want to go there ;). [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:15, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

::::Heh. I wonder what the predominant unit usage is in english-speaking countries.... I was actually thinking that at some point we might get actual useful tools inside of templates (calculations, conditionals, etc) and that an prescribed order might help that. But that is the future. For now it doesn't really matter at all except for stylistic reasons. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:28, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::Getting back to what I was origionally suggesting though. Do you agree that we should change Template:Recipesummary and Template:Recipe Summary so that the ''Calories'' field is labelled ''Energy'' instead? [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:51, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::: Yeah. Do it. Do you have any other suggestions about the other fields? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:03, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::::Done. The rest of it looks good.;) [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:33, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::::Now that I think about it, we could have a nutrition template too. It could have the fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, sugars, sodium, vitamins, etc. content per serving. The problem is that it would be a pain to insist that everyone calculated these values, and some contributors would want to specify a subset of all of the possible quantities (e.g, they may not know, or care to calculate, the selenium content of the dish). [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:44, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

::::::::This is already done. I found a single recipe with one ([[Cookbook:Spiced Pumpkin Soup]]) and made a template. See [[Cookbook:Policy]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:52, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::::::Again, we probably need to standardise somehow. Maybe it would be more useful to state the quantities of each constituent per 100 grams (or as a percentage by weight if you don't like the metric system), that would give people a better idea of what was good and what was bad for them, at a glance. Giving the weight of a serving is a given though.

:::::::::Stating the percentage of the RDI for vitamins is fraught with problems, as different governments have different recommendations! The template should allow it, but the mass (in micrograms or milligrams?) may be more useful. Again, we could just leave it up to the contributor to decide.

:::::::::Also, because it's going to be a really long template, maybe there is a way of electing to leave bits out (like the vitamins, or the minerals). I'm still trying to get my head around writing templates like this. When I get a bit of free time, in a couple of days, I'll try to come up with something workable. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:16, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

::::::::::With how mediawiki currently works, there is not really any way to leave things out so far as I can tell. What I said before about &quot;conditionals&quot; (if-then statements as in programming) and their non-existence in mediawiki means that there is nothing optional in a template. If you leave something out  you get the fun &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; output. We could make a bunch of different templates that each showed some part of the nutrition stuff, but that seems like less useful work than other things, and it seems like we should really just push for conditional statments in mediawiki. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:20, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

==Cross-referencing==
Out of boredom, love of food, and love of plants, I've begun cross-referencing Wikipedia, Wiki-Cookbook and Wiki-Gardening entries. Are there any other wiki-resources I should also include? Wiktionary, I suppose.... Also, I tried the cookbookpar template on Gardening entries but it doesn't seem to work... --[[User:Bleh fu|bleh fu]] [[User talk:Bleh fu|&lt;small&gt;talk fu&lt;/small&gt;]] 20:04, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== overlapping categories ==

I've spent the last little bit tagging all the linked vegan recipes with [[:Category:Vegan recipes]], but there are also subcategories in the vegan hierarchy (e.g. [[:Category:Vegan desserts]] and [[:Category:Vegan soups]]). Seems to me this is redundant and a vegan soup should be tagged as vegan and also with soup, but not with the redundant: vegan, soup, vegan soup. Since there are other divisions (by diet, region) it seems like the de-facto categorization will force us to recreate all the top-level categories under each specific category. A better way to do this would be some sort of set difference for the categories (e.g. to see the overlap of vegan recipes and soups). There's probably not a way to do this in mediawiki yet, eh? Tired. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 8 July 2005 07:59 (UTC)

== listing of everything in Cookbook: namespace ==

You can get a listing of everything with the &quot;Cookbook:&quot; prefix [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Allpages&amp;from=Cookbook: here]. It's not a purely cookbook listing, but good enough for gov't work. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 02:48, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

== policy page ==

I created a policy page at [[Cookbook:Policy]]. So far this only has the available templates and capitalization rules. I think we should try to set consistent policies for these things. Yeah. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 03:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
:Nicely done. This is the sort of fussy business that makes me happy. :) --[[User:Bleh fu|bleh fu]] [[User talk:Bleh fu|&lt;small&gt;talk fu&lt;/small&gt;]] 06:10, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

==featured recipe policy==
Since most contributors probably aren't watching the policy module, I'll ask this here -- what's the policy for changing the featured recipe? I'd like to nominate my [[Cookbook:Flaky_Pie_Crust]] recipe as the featured recipe. It has lots of pictures! It's used in the [[Cookbook:Rhubarb Pie]], the [[Cookbook:Strawberry Rhubarb Pie]] and the [[Cookbook:Pennsylvania_Pot_Pie]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:53, 18 July 2005 (UTC)
:It certainly has enough pictures. :) However, I think a featured recipe should be something 'finished'. You don't exactly eat a piecrust on it's own. The strawberry rhubarb pie would make a nice featured recipe, I think (pitty you don't have a photograph of the finished pie though, that would make it perfect). My thoughts on a policy; a featured recipe should ideally have the following characteristics: properly formatted, describes a 'finished' dish and a photograph (preferably of the end product). I basically see the featured recipe as an advertisement for the cookbook, the more it makes your mouth water, the better. [[User:Risk|risk]]
::Good points! My roommates ate the pies before I could take nice pics. I'll take some the next time I make one (the pies all look the same on the outside anyhow =) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 07:22, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

Trying to codify this... A featured recipe should:
* have a picture of the finished recipe
* follow the recipe template
* have a recipe summary
* have proper categories (by ingredient, diet, region, etc as appropriate)
* be an entire food item (i.e. not a component as in pie crust, sauces)

How often should they be changed? I think Paella has been up for 2 months now...
[[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 08:16, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
: That seems to cover it. I think the original idea for the featured recipe was a new one every week. So I'd say a new one as soon as possible (or whenever someone feels like it) with a minimum time of one week for each recipe. This does give us the problem of running out of recipes if we actually manage to stick to the one week rule. Mzybe we need a page (or a category) for recipes that are eligible for featured recipe, so we can easily find them and rotate every so many weeks. All this applies to the featured ingredient too, of course. [[User:Risk|risk]] 14:41, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
::I'll set up a category and link it from the Talk page for the featured recipe/ingredient. I'll also add this little bit to the [[Cookbook:Policy]] page. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:59, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

:::Just for background, I used to do all the featured stuff all by myself, and I tried to change the content somewhere between one and two weeks, normally around every 10 days.  Most of the time I did what the policy now states, picking failry complete modules, but every once in a while I'd add something that needed work, just to give it some exposure and help it grow (that didn't work very well, actually).  Then I started slowing down, because life got in the way of Wikibooks, and because I wanted to see if someone else would change the content on their own.  When Albert changed to Paella and bacon, I thought someone else had decided to take up the challenge, so I stopped paying attention to the templates.  After realizing the featured recipe and ingredient hadn't changed in months, I decided to take quick action to fix the problem. When I just now changed the templates, I didn't know a new policy had been enacted, so I went back to somewhat shady &quot;featured&quot; modules, to encourage their growth.  Please feel free to change them in accordance with the new policies. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 23:51, 5 August 2005 (UTC)
::::That's fine, the &quot;Policy&quot; is not actually supposed to be ''setting'' policy so much as reflecting what we actually do. If it's not reflective, that page should be changed (the policy, not the featured one) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:00, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

== Cookbook pages needing work ==

I've created a category, [[:Category:Cookbook_pages_needing_work]], for cookbook pages in need of help. See [[Cookbook:Policy]] for more info. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 04:48, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

== comment on cookbook ==
I'm really glad to have found this cookbook, and I think it's going to be usd a lot once it contains a few more recipes. Just one idea to make it much more useful: all recipes should be catgorised according to how long they take. Usually people only have a certain amount of time for cooking, so that really determines what recips will be of use to them. Sorry - haven't got time to do it myself now. [[User:217.43.64.160|217.43.64.160]] 18:03, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

::This is a pretty good idea. We should be able to do this from the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{recipesummary}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template once everything gets more standardized. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 19:15, 28 July 2005 (UTC)

== even more awesome cookbook feature ==

On [http://www.recipezaar.com recipezaar], there is support for dynamic &quot;filters&quot; -- adding and removing categories and only seeing the set intersection. Here's:
* [http://www.recipezaar.com/r/184 English recipes]
* [http://www.recipezaar.com/r/184/87 English Desserts recipes]
* [http://www.recipezaar.com/r/184/87/51 English Desserts Pies &amp; Tarts  recipes]
* [http://www.recipezaar.com/r/184/87/51/177/179 English Desserts Pies &amp; Tarts Pies Crusts/Pastry Dough recipes]
RAD! The categories here seem like they could support this with relatively little work, but there would also need to be an interface. Perhaps one of you other coders wants to jam yourself into mediawiki development and do this? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 17:18, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

== Search ==

I think search within the cookbook is obscure and a search engine of sorts should be created. As well the wikisoft should be modified to create auto-linking, but I see where that could be tricky and lead to uber-linking, and besides it's not talk for right here. Anyways, for example: I've just made a (three) lemon pie, and have a LOT of merengue left over, so now I have merengue, and I don't know what to do with it. I was searching for something easy to make with merengue but I don't know how to find this. --[[User:Lacrymology|Lacrymology]] 12:53, 4 August 2005 (UTC)
:: You make meringue cookies with chocolate chips. Just fold in the chocolate chips, then scoop spoonfuls onto a baking sheet. Cook at 250 i think for 45 mins to an hour i believe -- this was on &quot;everyday food&quot; so its kinda hazy. We also need a search. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 18:15, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

== initial recipe formatting complete! ==

I have gone through all the recipes listed in [[Cookbook:Recipes]] and added appropriate templates, done some formatting, and added obvious categories. There are some recipes not listed there, including some tagged with [[:Category:Cookbook pages needing work]], which I intend to do next. Some issues came up during this, including:
* Whether [[:Category:Recipes]] is really the right place for a recipe listing (I would say no and that [[:Category:Recipe]] would be better -- this would require a bot, a bunch of null edits, or mediawiki admin's help since it involves templates and categories)
* Whether we need a more complete recipe summary with origin and &quot;type&quot; (vegetarian, etc)
* How we should deal with categories for ingredients, origin, etc with an eye on how mediawiki actually works for now
* What suggestions we can make regarding improvements to mediawiki that would make our lives as contributors easier (Category intersection comes to mind for me)
Yeah. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 19:36, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Twistofreality. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Twistofreality~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

[[Image:Rainbow-Jello-Full-2004-July-30.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainbow Jell-O made from this recipe in a trapezoidal pyrex dish (uncut).]]
[[Image:Rainbow-Jello-Cut-2004-Jul-30.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The same Jell-O, cut and viewed from the end.]]

'''Rainbow Jell-O''' - a multilayered, multiflavored Jell-O extravaganza; based on a recipe from [http://www.kraftfoods.com/main.aspx?s=recipe&amp;m=recipe/knet_recipe_display&amp;u1=keyword&amp;u2=rainbow&amp;u3=**6*6&amp;wf=9&amp;recipe_id=50315 Kraft].

This recipe takes about five hours to prepare, although the time is spent largely in waiting; it is therefore best to plan to intersperse it with other activity and, if they don't mind the constant smell of Jell-O, best done with other people. It yields ten (or as many as you want) layers, alternating opaque and clear, of five colors. (The sour cream or yogurt, used for opacity, cannot be tasted in the final product.)

== Ingredients ==

These ingredients will be divided between the layers of the rainbow Jell-O:

*6 1/4 cups (around 1.5l) boiling water
*5 (or more) packages Jell-O gelatin (4-serving size each; different flavors and colors)
*1 cup (240g) sour cream or plain or vanilla yogurt

== Procedure ==

# Select one or more molds. The total volume will be approximately eight cups; a ring mold, two or three glass containers (as pictured), or any other assortment should work; for best results, the container should be at least 3in (10cm) deep, allowing for about ten 1cm-thick layers.
# Stir 1 1/4 cups boiling water and one package gelatin in a small bowl for at least two minutes, until completely dissolved. (In practice, it may not quite completely dissolve.)
# Pour 3/4 cups dissolved gelatin into the mold(s).
# Refrigerate for about 15 minutes, until the gelatin sets but is not yet firm: the gelatin should stick to your finger when you touch it. (The aim is for the layers to stick, but not mix.)
# Refrigerate the remaining gelatin for about 5 minutes, until it is slightly thickened (to the consistency of unbeaten egg white).
# Gradually stir 3 tablespoons sour cream or yogurt into the remaining, thickened gelatin.
# Spoon the gelatin on top of the previous layer (gently, so as to maintain a smooth surface).
# Refrigerate again for about 15 minutes.
# Repeat the above for each of the remaining flavors. Be sure to cool adequately between layers to prevent melting and mixing.
# When finished, refrigerate for about 2 hours, until firm. Remove the gelatin from the mold and place it (probably upside down) on a plate or smooth cutting board. Store refrigerated under saran wrap or aluminum foil. For best effect, serve sliced perpendicular to the layers, so each slice (approximately 1cm thick) displays the full rainbow.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Naib. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Naib~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== language ==

i think it needs to be kept in mind that a truely good book on compilers will allow for languages that are not syntactically similar to C or Pascal (Lisp or Scheme come to mind). if we are sticking to a functional-C++ subset, it might be in everybody's best interests to a) list all aspects of ANSI C++ that will be excluded from this text, and B) formally define the aspects that will be used, for the programmer that has no knowledge of C++. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 05:54, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

== regular expression syntax ==

it is interesting to me (although it is not necessarily a bad thing) to note that the regular expression syntax is all in Lex format. it might be beneficial to link to a Regular Expression primer, or to go into more detail about the regular expressions then can be found in the Flex Man pages. For that matter, if we are sticking to a de facto lex syntax, it might be beneficial to include state-conditionals in the introduction (&lt;state&gt; [form] [rules]). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 05:57, 24 August 2005 (UTC)

== Question ==
under '''Introducing Compilers and Interpreters''' / ''The compilation process'', there is the following line of text:

&quot;Some compiler-writing tools are available which can reduce this size, but adds corresponding dependencies.&quot;

Could someone clarify this? What is meant by &quot;this size&quot; and which are the &quot;corresponding dependencies&quot;?

:It seems that it was just moved around a bit, I've placed it into a valid context now...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:33, 6 July 2011 (UTC)

== The source language is '''always''' a higher-level language in comparison to machine code ==

I think *always* is an overkill. There could be a case where the source code is complicated but after all the optimizations is reduced to something simpler like say a complex formula that is substituted with a constant.

:I disagree. The &quot;source language&quot; refers to a compilable language. Since machine code is the lowest level a language can be (at machine level), there is no possibility of compiling machine code (one can convert it and optimize it) but not compile it as it is already at the lowest degree. Even in conversions they will require that the source machine code be converted to a upper level before generating the target code, and any other &quot;conversion&quot; will not be labeled a compilation (as done by a compiler).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:50, 7 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

'''Hot milk cake''' is a traditional two-layer [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]], possibly from the [[w:Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic States]]. It can be [[Cookbook:Icing|frosted]] with [[Cookbook:Mocha icing|mocha icing]].

Hot milk cake can be fabulous, but the recipe is not for the timid.  Expect a couple attempts that fail to rise before getting it right.  Beating the eggs very well is important.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|c]] (240 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|whole milk]]
* &amp;#189; cup (120 ml) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|t]] (5 ml) [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] extract
* 2 cups (480 ml) cake [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] or, 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|T]] (60 ml) [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] and enough all-purpose flour to equal 2 cups
* 2 tsp (10 ml) [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* Pinch of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 4 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 2 cups (480 ml) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]

==Procedure==
# An hour before baking, take eggs and butter out of the refrigerator to reach room temperature.
# Heat together milk and butter until butter melts.  Cool to just warm.
# Add vanilla.
# If you sift the flour, do so after measuring.  Mix dry ingredients.
# In a large bowl beat the eggs until lemon-colored &amp;mdash; this could take 5-10 minutes.
# Add sugar slowly, beating well.
# Add the dry ingredients.
# Add milk mixture very slowly, folding it in by hand toward the end.
# Divide the batter into 2 greased and floured 9 inch (230 mm) round cake pans.
# Bake about 30 minutes at 350 °F (175 °C).
# Cool on racks for 10 minutes (you may need to run a knife around the edge first) then turn out to cool.
# Frost with [[Cookbook:Mocha icing|mocha icing]], other icing, or with [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberries]].

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Calculus Book ==
I left that calculus thing alone a long time ago.
Uh, right now I'm a fulltime student so my time isn't going to be direct towards wikiprojects for more than 01:30 a day.

The idea of this project was to layout a calculus teaching system so that people were questioned, tutorialed, walked-through, and given guidance and how to solve problems and find help if they can't solve them. The idea here is that if you diversify yourself all over the web in different locations asking questinos, you'll obtain the answer likely sooner in one place than another. However, in that situation sometimes people will learn something new and get a different insight from different people. Diversity of asking questions in different places of the web is one of the best ways to get an answer really, really quick and efficiently. That's where the 90 day idea comes in. You study, do the problems, look at the answers, ask for help if you need to. If the detailed answer doesn't give enough information, people will be told to diversify themselves over the web in different math forums asking question. It will also be suggested that if you can make some online math friends, that will help you greatly.

For the users of this project to contribute greatly, it would be nice if they posted a weblink in the discussion section of the problem as to where on the web they discussed the math problem and obtained information and answers. That way people won't bring up the same subject over, and over, and over, in the same math forum: which is something I'd hate to do to the math forums.

It's advised that they type wiki at the bottom of their math questionaire when going to ask for help, that way if people search through a forum board with a search feature, they can simply type in wiki+trig, or something of the sort, to find a page that relates to a question/discussion on something created by people who used the wikipedia project. By telling the people who are using this system to follow these rules, they will add greatly to the success of the wikibook. Sometimes I wonder if I'm hoping too much. However the case, it seems like a great system.

Also, another thing was to provide a subsection of each section that gave out questions, also there would be a step-by-step analysis of how the answer was obtained.

Sorry I left the project alone, but I don't have very much time to do anything until Dec 16 or so. 

Also, the reason I want it to be detailed with the answers is because it will help people obtain an udnerstanding of the answer was obtained. Usually in math there are answers that are unique and very different, some answers a person should just be able to look at and answer in about a second. That's why I wanted to make it somewhat detailed.

----
There are two cities, one of them is called City of Lies, and the other - City of Truth. Those who were born in City of Lies always lie. Those who were born in City of Truth always tell truth.
What is a question you can pose to a resident (of one of the 2 cities) that will yield the same answer,  irrespective of which city that resident belongs to ?

This A-level physics book is designed to follow the [http://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/81024-specification.pdf OCR GCE Physics A specification]. For the OCR B 'Advancing Physics' specification, see [[A-level Physics (Advancing Physics)]]. You can use this book as a revision guide, or as another explanation of concepts that you may not fully understand. 

Before you begin this course, it is recommended that you understand some of the basic concepts covered in [[GCSE Science]], and have an understanding of the [[A-level Physics/The SI System of Units|SI unit system]] (Appendix A).

If you find any mistakes, errors, broken links, or if you are able to make the content easier to understand, please '''do not hesitate''' to edit and expand on existing content.
__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
==New Specification Modules==
The new specification contains the following modules.
This course is split into 6 units. There are 4 exams and 2 practical assessments which are counted as coursework. The AS and A2 modules add up to make the course. AS makes up 50% of the course and A2 makes up the other 50%. Each year, candidates will be assessed on their practical skills. each practical assessment counts towards 10% of the A level and the first assessment counts towards 20% of the AS grade.

===AS Modules===
* {{stage short|00%|May 31, 2014}}[[/Mechanics/]]
* {{stage short|25%|May 31, 2014}}[[/Electrons, Waves and Photons NEW SPECIFICATION/|Electrons, Waves and Photons ]]

===A2 New Specification Modules===
* {{stage short|00%|May 31, 2014}}[[/The Newtonian World/]]
* {{stage short|50%|June 18, 2014}}[[/Fields, Particles and Frontiers of Physics/]]

==Old Specification Modules==
The old syllabus for Physics A had the following modules:

===AS Modules===
*[[/Forces and Motion|Force(s) and Motion]] {{stage short|25%|Aug 30, 2011}}
*[[/Electrons, Waves and Photons/]]  {{stage short|25%|Aug 30, 2005}}
*[[A-level Physics/Wave Properties|Wave Properties]]  {{stage short|00%|Aug 30, 2005}}

===A2 Core Modules===
*[[/Forces, Fields and Energy/]]  {{stage short|25%|Aug 30, 2005}}
*[[/Unifying Concepts in Physics/]]  {{stage short|00%|Aug 30, 2005}}

===A2 Option Modules===
You are only required to complete one of the optional modules.
*[[/Cosmology/]]  {{stage short|00%|Aug 30, 2005}}
*[[A-level Physics/Health Physics|Health Physics]]  {{stage short|00%|Aug 30, 2005}}
*[[/Materials/]]  {{stage short|00%|Aug 30, 2005}}
*[[A-level Physics/Nuclear and Particle Physics|Nuclear and Particle Physics]]  {{stage short|00%|Aug 30, 2005}}
*[[A-level Physics/Telecommunications|Telecommunications]]  {{stage short|00%|Aug 30, 2005}}

In both AS and A2, practical modules have to be completed, consisting of qualitative, quantitative and evaluative sections. At A2 level, in the second year of study, you must take the two core A2 modules along with one of the option modules.

==Appendices==

;Appendix A
*{{stage short|100%|Aug 30, 2005}}[[/The SI System of Units/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although life’s imagined omnipotent climax is nothing more than a possible, perhaps probable, conclusion to evolution, it does seem to be our best choice of meta-purpose, the one that would then be used to guide the written definition of a universal purpose. Nothing else so focuses our attention upon ensuring that life (which includes us) has a future. When we select and use this meta-purpose we are forced to pay attention to the health of our planet, and our survival chances increase (to say nothing of the quality of life we live). No other purpose so aptly points out the criteria we need to use when making moral decisions (see [[../../Determining Moral Behaviours/]] for illustrative examples) both today and in the future.

However, there is another, and, at first sight, strong, meta-purpose contender that has not yet been mentioned. In recent years, the idea of zero growth or sustainable development has been much debated. It would be quite possible to select this as our meta-purpose, and make moral decisions guided by the need to maintain the planetary status quo. It would be quite possible, but it would be an appalling choice.

In a zero-growth state, production levels just balance requirement levels. All life would exist in peaceful equilibrium, as some seem to believe was once the case. However, such a state never existed. Life has always exploited its environment for resources, and life forms that do not continuously attempt to take all possible advantages will be overtaken by others that do. Stagnant life does not survive.

A two-way disruptive process featuring life and its environment operates continuously. Environmental changes precipitate evolutionary changes, and life’s evolution disrupts its environment, particularly the number and kind of other life forms that live in the vicinity. In the past, life-effected disruptions were minor and local in scale; today, due principally to population and technology, they are not. We notice environmental degradation now due to its extent and magnitude. It is pervasive and escalating, because we have just about shut down or eliminated many of life’s formerly capacious buffering biomes, but also because we are running out of planet to exploit. This last factor, were we to adopt a zero growth rate, would soon create serious psychological consequences.

Mankind has not yet absorbed the fact that there is almost nowhere else on Earth to go. This planet has always provided new and interesting territory for humans to discover, explore and exploit. The open space and natural wealth found as our reach expanded provided avenues of escape for the oppressed and a challenge for the restless. This, in turn, helped to maintain the political and social stability of the countries left behind, and enabled the population explosion that has been our constant companion for the past three centuries. But we have reached our territorial limit. Today, only the oceans and space itself remain unexplored.

Psychologically we have not fully realized what this means. Subconsciously (particularly in the West), we still expect that limitless expansion—moving on, growing, and building a place of our own—will always be the intrinsic state of affairs. Life has been able to expand upon this planet, in one manner or another, for the past four billion years. Room to roam and exploit has always been at hand for all who so desired. It was always thus—but is so no longer. And, when we eventually have no place to walk that has not been trod before, have only food that has been artificially modified in some manner, have instant but sanitized and censored news and ideas, and have only vacations that are virtual, or made of fibreglass and plastic, how then will we feel?

I think that I would feel I was approaching the end of all that was good in life. I would begin to think about the end of the world and about death, for, in an entirely controlled world that was going nowhere, I would see no future and no hope. Indeed, this is just how things do begin to appear for many of us, in our final years. When there seems to be nothing new to put your hand or mind to, one becomes suddenly very old. And this is likely to be how the population of a zero-growth world would feel, once it is realized that the planet has been ravished and the opportune time to expand into space was missed.

Expansion is necessary for life’s continued development—even expansion into space, throughout our galaxy and into others beyond. Yet life on this planet may have only the needed resources and psychological energy for one shot. It would dishonour all that life has accomplished to throw this opportunity away.

There is another aspect to this discussion about the viability of a zero-growth future. Evolutionary change occurs only when possible and advantageous: when niches open up, when food supplies vary, or when a mutation confers a bonus. If niches never alter, change brings penalty, not reward. If we choose zero growth, if we immobilize our niche, we will cease evolving. Without challenge, we do not advance. ''H. sapiens'' will regress and degenerate into obscurity.

There is only one direction to go, and that is forward. Returning to past views returns us to wars about beliefs, and ignores or debases scientific truth. Standing still amounts to slow death. We must go forward. Forward, eventually into space, amassing knowledge, understanding, and gaining an ever greater ability to control as we go.

As I have written earlier, there seems only one logical consequence to going forward forever. Life eventually, surely, must become an entity possessing omnipotent capabilities—oB. If this is so, or indeed, even if this is just a possibility, then why not adopt this endpoint as a surrogate “meta-purpose,” use it to define a robust “universal purpose,” then make collective moral decisions aimed at achieving that purpose? What better choice could we possibly make?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why bother to do anything, when life will continue no matter what we do, and when, anyway, life may be ultimately purposeless and meaningless? These, indeed, are compelling questions.

If we take the short-term view, say for the next one hundred years or so, then, exactly, why bother? Why not just enjoy ourselves? Who cares what happens to life after we and our immediate descendants have gone? Does it matter that the world’s quality of life will deteriorate as resources run out and pollutants pile up—people will get used to it and will know no better. If all that really matters is we who are living right here and now, then, certainly, why bother?
 
I suppose that narcissists, despotic and repressive dictators, psychopaths, and perhaps a few others may think this way. But I’m certain that you do not, for you would not have read what I have written so far were this the case. We must bother, because we care, and the majority of the world’s population also cares about others and the future they will have. Proof exists everywhere: thousands of schools, libraries, parks, museums, art galleries, specialty hospitals, and institutions throughout the world, owe their origin to individuals who cared, and their continuance to others who still care. Millions of individuals dedicate their time, energy and resources to help others less fortunate. Caring about and for others is part of the human condition.

The choice of meta-purpose and definition of a universal purpose must not be left to our various levels of government. Those who govern are seldom inclined to look more than five or ten years ahead—we need to think in terms of five or ten ''hundred'' years and more. Surely it is aggregated actions of individuals, not governments, that instigate enduring change.

However, it is important that the choice of meta-purpose not be left to any single individual—it must be a collective judgment. Consider inaction once more, but from this perspective. Let’s say that we do nothing, that we ignore the eventual need for a universal, integrating, fact-based religion. Almost certainly, some visionary will see the need and will come forth to lead us into a new (or back into an old) world-correcting religion. Many scenarios are possible, of course, but, to me, none seem attractive, for in all of them we would be lead by a single mind, and relinquish our freedom to choose. No matter how pleasant our existence might become, no matter how benign or how benevolent such a person might be, it would be their personal bias, their mental construct, we would be following. Effectively, life would just be putting in time until that person’s conception was overtaken by events or facts and required rewriting, just as may now be happening with our old religions. We would merely be swapping existing imaginings for a new set, repeating history (possibly even locked into a never-ending cycle), with humanity slowly decaying under its load of competing faiths and goals.

It is for this precise reason that the impartial facts must show us the way, not one individual’s emotional constructs. Let a multitude work together to interpret the known universal facts, then collectively design a morality that fits both reality and human needs—one that can be up-dated as new knowledge dictates. (But more about how this might be done later.)

Again, we could do nothing, and just aim to enjoy ourselves. And, why not? Isn’t this, more or less, the way many of us already live? Does it even matter—for in the long run the human species will certainly be replaced by another, just as has happened with other species so many times in the past.

Yes, certainly, humans will eventually be overtaken by, or evolve into, other species. So, in the longer run of things, why should it matter what we do today? Is there significance to anything we do? If not, why should we exert ourselves?

We must make this effort because, within the past quarter-million years or so, life has attained the ability to build upon the intellectual gains of the past. This development is extremely valuable, and to simply throw it away would be an enormous setback to life. Previously, life’s evolutionary masterpieces left little more than decaying matter and a minuscule amount of knowledge for future species to utilize. This is no longer the case. Humans now leave records of their errors and achievements that others can use and benefit from. Our knowledge and understanding, often almost in its entirety, is passed on to the future. We must care about what purpose we select to guide our moral and practical decision making, because the lives of our descendants will be affected by how we behave as we follow our choices. We must not sit back and let unreasonable fundamentalists or irrational fanatics set our path, for they often destroy records of the past in trying to ensure the future of their fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;The great library of Alexandria, for example, was deliberately burnt (on three occasions, by order of three different rulers, according to legend). Jewish relics were destroyed in Nazi Germany, as were 1500 year old colossal Buddhas and other museum artifacts recently in Afghanistan (where Taliban rulers thought their existence “un-Islamic”).&lt;/ref&gt; We cannot risk having our hard-won knowledge destroyed, as we now have so much to contribute.

Let me describe what I think we present-day humans have to contribute to the future. I might best do so by discussing three time periods: the near term, the middle term, and the ultimate.

As we begin this new century we bring with us more than two millennia of religious conflict. This discord exists at the personal level, where, in many minds, fears of afterlife “penalties” battle with hopes of an everlasting reward. And it exists at the community level, wherever the Catholic vs. Protestant, Christian vs. Muslim vs. Hindu, and all the other religion-based conflicts, occur, in so many places around the world. If we do not attempt to unite differences under a collective universal purpose, this situation is bound to continue. But if we choose a new purpose that looks forwards instead of continually backwards, there is a chance that these conflicts may eventually die out. What is preferable to pass to our successors: fears, bitterness and outdated notions from the past; or consideration, vision and reality-based hope for the future? The best short-term contribution we could possibly make would be to revise our view of what is important in life. We bequeath a disturbing legacy to our children if their only choices to satisfy their need for a religion are those that rule by fear and ferment discord. We must offer an alternative—one that might be developed if a suitable collective meta-purpose were first adopted. In my view, this would be the best short-term contribution we could make to humanity’s path forward.

To appreciate the possible value of the middle-term contribution I will be suggesting, we must project into the future. Eventually, although perhaps not for several hundred years, we will encounter intelligent life elsewhere. This may be via electromagnetic radiation of some frequency, such as radio waves, light waves or the like. Perhaps this will occur by way of interacting space probes, or through quantum space tunnelling. Or, maybe we will develop something like telepathy, if ever such a transmission mode is uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;The amount of information our senses detect from the total available in the full electromagnetic spectrum (and discounting any other spectrum of information that might exist) is probably comparable to the fraction represented by one day out of a full year.&lt;/ref&gt; However it occurs, when we do interact with an intelligent alien species what will matter most in what we communicate will be our identity, not our knowledge, because they will more than likely possess at least our level of understanding about the universe. As part of assessing our merits, what will likely be of most interest to exospecies will be who we are, what we think about ourselves, and what is important to us. To convey that we periodically take up arms and kill each other, that we routinely destroy our own habitats, that we have not supported the continuance of other species—these attributes should disgrace us, not to mention alarm those we communicate with. But to also reveal that the majority of us fear death while nevertheless believing that after death we assume a loving relationship with the “Creator” after destroying what He has created—what kind of fallacious thinking is this? (I am glad that I will not be here to witness us tell aliens this, for I would be so ashamed of our human condition.) I would not blame any sentient being for immediately terminating contact with entities advocating such beliefs and actions.

But to convey that we think, or even believe, that life, everywhere, is embarked on a journey of discovery; that it will learn and grow in ability as it voyages; that it will unite in learning with other sentient beings along the way and eventually coalesce into one entity that possesses “god-like” abilities—would be wonderful. Were I in their shoes, I would want to learn from a civilization with such concepts, for their convictions accept and embrace me, as well as all of life. Indeed, a universal belief such as this could well be our most valuable medium-term contribution to life’s future.

Our possible long-term gift may be to contribute to the way this universe ends. Let me elaborate.

I fantasize about life’s potential behaviour as it approaches an omnipotent state. This may take place in several locations throughout the universe at more or less the same time, or it may happen only once, in some well-favoured locale. I ask myself what such an entity would do next. All its history has been spent acquiring knowledge and learning how to control matter and events, but this magnificent endeavour would be reaching an end. Presumably, it would have long since sought and found other pockets of advanced life, then merged and consolidated knowledge and abilities. Presumably too, if there were other such beings, all would unite to form one “oB” for the same reason. Eventually, there would be nothing new to learn, nothing which hadn’t been experienced at least once, or couldn’t be experienced if considered worth the effort.

And ultimately, this being would be all alone. After maybe thousands or millions of millennia spent learning from, being with, and perhaps uniting with a multitude of other complex life forms, there will be none of equal capabilities remaining in the universe. In effect, oB will have consolidated all knowledge and experience into its own being. It will have no mental companions and few challenges left to surmount. What might such an entity do?

Moreover, time within the universe may be coming to an end for life. There may be very few energy differences remaining to exploit, as expansion and entropy take their toll on all that is physical, or as the universe collapses into a terminating singularity. And this entity’s abilities will be retained only as long as there remain energy differences that can be exploited and put to use, for even it must obey the laws of physics and the demands of its supersystem, the universe.

Surely, as the sole and complete repository of all that is to be learned from within the universe, oB wouldn’t just wither and expire. I find that very hard to imagine. But, there might be one last endeavour that it might undertake, some deed that would represent a fitting end for a being of such capability. Conceivably, oB could perhaps arrange matters so that the universe would rebound and restart, creating a new one from the old. Such a scenario might just be possible. Knowing all there is to know might point to a way that this could be done. A complete fantasy to us, yes, but to it? We do not know enough to judge.

The additional challenge for oB then, would be to see if it could somehow improve upon the past universe, perhaps slightly modifying one or more parameters, so making it possible for life in the subsequent universe to develop in new ways.

This, to me, is a very attractive thought. It opens the possibility of life being truly without end. In this fantasy, life effectively hibernates at the end of each universe, its existence to be reconstructed in the next. Each successive universe is given its initiating parameters in the final act of the oB of the universe past. In this way, we might have an endless, continually varying succession of life-bearing universes. Reincarnations without end.

Indeed, if this is what might come to be in the far, far distant future of this universe, then it follows that it could also have happened in the past, before time in this universe began. What can happen endlessly in the future can also have happened countless times in the past; an infinity of times in one direction necessitates an infinity of times in the other. And (but, I think, only in a context such as this), we could then even say that a god did create this universe. A god of the universe past, formed from the life that evolved in that earlier universe, itself created by the succession of gods of prior universes, without beginning or end. Who knows; perhaps this past god did implant the conditions necessary and sufficient for life to form, when it structured the laws of physics that we are beginning to understand and utilize today.&lt;ref&gt;That the exact parameters necessary for life to arise and evolve within the universe were built into the universe at its beginnings has been postulated by many authors. Perhaps the most significant contribution to this discussion has been made by Barrow and Tipler in ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle''. They maintain that a life-giving factor had to have been designed into the origins of the universe. Their rationale is that none of the fundamental dimensionless constants of physics can be altered without resulting in a universe that could not support life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This theory, of course, has been countered. The most significant rebuttal contends that this universe could be just one of an infinite number of universes, each somewhat different from the other. Those that provide conditions that allow life to exist, eventually develop life; those that do not, do not. By definition, we must exist within a life-developing universe, and the fact that its parameters cannot be changed without making it unable to support life proves nothing. Martin Rees has written an interesting and relatively short book that explores the significance of these universal constants, and prefers this latter explanation of our existence. (Martin Rees, ''Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces that Shape the Universe'' [New York: Basic Books, 2000].) Superstring theory (see [[../../Gödel’s Theorem, General Systems Theory, and The Conservation Laws/]]) actually predicts the existence of an infinite number of universes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Barrow and Tipler conclude that we must be the only intelligent life to exist (which might be inferred from the title they chose for their publication). This is an unlikely possibility in most scientists’ view, given the vast number of planets that must exist. Toward the end of their book Barrow and Tipler argue that, once begun, life must continue to evolve until it has “regulated” everything within all possible universes (pages 675 and 677). I agree, as the similar conclusion formed in this book indicates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scenario, if we need to give praise to anything, it would have to be to the life within universes past that created the universe present. And future life, in future universes, would be indebted to the final life form that evolves within this universe.&lt;ref&gt;This is where the “life-becomes-god” scenario differs from the gods of old. Previous conceptions of god install him before the universe began; this book’s vision sees a god-like entity emerging as the culmination of life’s evolution, not existing until the universe has spawned life and life has developed to its full. In this scenario, either the universe developed spontaneously from nothing (or vacuum energy, see [[../../The Universe/The Expanding Universe#cite_note-8|The Expanding Universe, footnote 9]]) or, as earlier noted, there was no beginning and no end, just an endless succession of universes, some generating life that evolves to possess god-like abilities.)&lt;/ref&gt; Formed, perhaps, with a contribution from us—if we survive to contribute—for this is where we might provide our long-term contribution.

In the very long run, millions or even billions of years ahead, what we have to contribute, I think, is our emotional perceptions of life’s significance. We don’t have to contribute our rationality, or our knowledge and understanding, because life forms everywhere will evolve toward intelligence, and will uncover exactly the same facts about life and the universe as we are discovering. The universe is everywhere governed by the same physical laws, and any conscious life, anywhere in the universe, should eventually be able to discover its properties and underlying controlling forces. However, humankind’s emotional outlook is unique to our species, and much of it is fleeting.

What might perhaps become our long term contribution is sometimes called our “spirituality” or our humanity. We feel it when we look at the stars, when we are alone by the sea, or in a quiet forest clearing. A wonder, an awe, a sense of beauty or mystery, a feeling of immense peace and oneness. We sense it, but it is very difficult to convey to others because words are defined by personal memories—individual mental constructs and their meanings reside only in individual minds. However, these very emotions may be what is important to contribute to life’s evolution in the long run.

We can’t precisely contribute these feelings by words, paintings or sculptures; such items are culture-bound and contain nuances that could never be fully comprehended many, many, millennia into the future. But we may be able to contribute our emotions through our music. The music of Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Sibelius, and of so very many more wonderful composers come to mind. Their symphonies, concertos, requiems, sonatas, masses, love-songs, blues and jazz—all convey something of the essence of what it is to be human. Just possibly, morsels of music might survive passage through the ages, a million or more millennia, and contribute a little of what it has meant to be human toward the final shaping of that which life will become and may do.

But exactly what difference would any of this make, in the very long run?

One last dream. Maybe, just maybe, perhaps through music, perhaps by some other means, the essence of our humanity, what we feel about life, now, in these still early stages of life’s intellectual journey, will be conveyed through time and make its way into the thoughts of oB, the god-like entity that life may become. Maybe our contribution will demonstrate how we feel about this marvellous life we live. Maybe our emotions today will affect oB’s outlook at time’s end.

And, maybe, just maybe, this is where we have most to offer. Maybe our feelings of happiness in simply being alive will influence the way oB designs the parameters that control life’s evolution in the next universe, if it were to take that last, final, step. For instance, oB  might make a change that could allow all future life to know more frequently the joy in living that today most of us only intermittently feel. To enrich the design of that which follows—what a contribution to make! To participate in creating a new beginning! That act alone adds purpose and meaning to each speck of life that has ever lived.

But, to make such a contribution, we must survive. And, we must make efforts to sustain our feelings of joy and spirituality, by living in expectant anticipation of the future. We must cease living in fear, mired in ideas from the past, as many of us seem to be today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So, why bother? Because the media and globalization—if nothing else&lt;ref&gt;Although computers may be having an equal or greater effect on the way we think and act. Successful computer operation entails learning new concepts and methods to solve the many minor problems that inevitably turn up. Tackling these challenges trains the mind to think logically (since all software has been logically developed). Moreover, computers connect individuals and ideas—ideas that may be very different from one country to another. Different ideas in a logical mind need reconciling, and new mental constructs and behaviours may develop.&lt;/ref&gt;—is forcing us to improve the way we think and act. Because we cannot continue indefinitely arguing and fighting among ourselves. What better time to stop and think about all we have endured, experienced and learned during these past millennia than now—now, at the beginning of a new millennium, and before we travel too far in the wrong direction. Now, now that we realize just how completely our minds shape all of our thoughts and actions.
 
Consider our new-found abilities—what might not be possible in just a few years? Our future can be wonderful, exciting and long, or it could be frightening, aimless and uncertain. The difference is simply a matter of taking the time to think, choosing a sensible direction to follow, and planning a path forward. We have gained the ability to think rationally. We have cultivated the intellect to discover the properties of matter and energy that open so many opportunities to us. And we are developing the technology that will allow us to colonize the planets, one that may later take us to the stars. The power and ability to control being unleashed by our increasing understanding appears to be unlimited. The choice of future is ours, and we are being asked to make it now. We can do nothing, and humanity may wither and die. Or we can unite in purpose and action, and humanity may flourish in ways it never has before.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter turns from conceptions to reality, and looks at some current global situations which might be improved were humanity to focus upon its collective future much more often than is the case today.

There are three factors related to purpose which are critical to the success of any organization’s endeavour—whether it is a corner store or an international conglomerate, and whether its aims are to make money, obtain power or preserve peace. These factors are vision, clarity and commitment.

Vision is important because visions, not purposes, excite efforts to succeed. It is the vision the preacher paints that holds our attention, not the bare statement that heaven, or hell, awaits. It is the vision of living in luxury and leisure that attracts many, not the target of amassing a million dollars. Visions are vastly more compelling than statements of purpose, but both are required when deciding how to act to solve problems
.
Clarity of purpose is important because clarity determines how well subordinate goals can be defined and prioritized, and how well actions can be planned, resourced, carried out and evaluated.
 
But commitment is most important of all, for no effort succeeds if those involved lack the desire for success.
These three factors are also collectively important, because together they help to foster unity of mind, thought and effort. Not a carbon-copy identical-ness or single-mindedness, but a common desire to attain a common goal, where individuals each play their part in their own way.

The possible applications discussed in this chapter thus call for these three components. The “vision” stems from adopting the idea of supporting Life’s journey to become oB as our meta-purpose; this provides the visionary power to surmount any distracting lesser purposes. “Clarity” stems from translating the meaning of this concept into a robust statement of “universal purpose,” a definition that allows practical actions to be planned and undertaken. And “commitment” will likely stem from involving many throughout the world in defining both of these concepts. (This third step is a fairly straight-forward [although lengthy and complex] procedure, and need not be discussed until later in the book.)

The possible applications of a universal purpose are many, but only a few will be raised here. The first issue below discusses how world problems are currently managed, and attempts to show in general terms why “purpose” is key to success. Subsequent examples are provided to illustrate the range and scope of our vision’s unifying possibility.
 
It is by no means certain that adopting a universal purpose, in an attempt to develop unity of desire and action, would change much in any of the situations presented below. Many of the issues are so large, and involve so many people, that any kind of change (particularly one of the magnitude and pervasiveness being suggested here) will require multiple years to take effect. But please do not dismiss the idea as naïve, simplistic or Pollyanna-ish before asking yourself whether what is being suggested offers any possibility for improvement over our present state of affairs.
 
If we grant that commitment to a clear purpose has critical organizing value and much to do with organizational success, then we are ready to examine some possible applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Large scale problems exist throughout the world. A few words can readily bring some to mind: famine, diseases, polluted water and air, drought, climate change, deforestation, resource depletion, species extinctions, soil loss, wars, genocide, corruption, social and economic disparities—once begun the list may run for pages. Lumped all together they are immensely depressing. Many seem irresolvable—how can we even hope to improve such situations?

It’s not that efforts haven’t been made. We have addressed these issues as nations by setting up international organizations. The United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, G8, UNESCO, NATO, OECD, and numerous other international bodies, are all intended to support, improve and preserve what the concerned influential regard as important.

Consider just one institution, the United Nations. Its website (http://www.un.org) illustrates the scope of its activities. At the time of writing, the UN site linked to the following sub-sites: Peace and Security (which stated that there were over 750,000 military and civilian personnel participating in some seventeen peace-keeping operations); Economic and Social Development (which linked to Environment, Population, Trade and Sustainable Development); Human Rights; and Humanitarian Affairs. From just one of these sub-sites (Environment) there were links to Climate Change, Ozone Depletion, Acid Rain, Hazardous Wastes and Chemicals, Biological Diversity, Fish and Marine Resources, Marine Pollution, Desertification, Forests, and Fresh Water. Within another (Population), data were presented that traces the world’s population from 300 million two millennia ago, doubling to 600 million three centuries ago, increasing tenfold to six billion today, and predicting a fifty percent increase—to hit nine billion—within the next two generations.&lt;br /&gt;Where will all these people live? Not in my backyard, you say? It is easy to view others outside of our immediate community as potential poachers, likely to take what we do not actively defend. We exhibit this kind of thought pattern when we erect trade barriers, restrict immigration, perpetuate or tolerate racial hatred, amass excessive wealth, or mouth obscenities in road-rage. As the world’s population increases, we can expect this behaviour to increase in frequency and degree, because life acts in this manner when its survival is threatened. If such behaviour is already happening, it is not too hard to predict how another two or three billion people will affect the quality of life for all, no matter where this increased number of people live.&lt;/ref&gt;

We have also tackled these matters on a somewhat less formal scale. There are hundreds of Not-For-Profit and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs), staffed by paid and voluntary workers. The World Health Organization alone, for instance, lists close to two hundred NGOs whose activities are related to health. There are countless others to be located via the web. Their sites typically outline their concerns, what has been accomplished, and what remains to be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Many organizations make efforts to educate the world’s public and influence opinions and activities. The World Resources Institute, for example, “provides information, ideas, and solutions to global environmental problems.” Its program advocates “knowledge to catalyze public and private action.” Its goals centre upon the Earth’s climate, its ecosystems, the environment, and use of materials. (See the WRI website, http://www.wri.org.) The Worldwatch Institute has similar concerns that can also be read on the web (see its website, http://www.worldwatch.org.)&lt;/ref&gt;

And we have also sought solutions as concerned communities. There must be thousands of small groups:&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hawken et al, in ''Natural Capitalism'' (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1999) estimates tens of thousands of groups.&lt;/ref&gt; churches, schools, colleges, clubs, associations and modest organizations, all striving to address issues of importance to them. Yet, even with all of this work being carried out, the overall number and magnitude of major world problems never seems to diminish.

Some problems are quickly solved, of course. Small groups, particularly, often make an immediate difference. Eyeglasses are delivered and fitted, a school is built, a well dug, water pipes laid, land irrigated, wind generators erected, hospitals staffed and supplied. Many beneficial results have been achieved.

Mid-sized organizations may not be able to act as promptly as smaller ones; however, money, tents, equipment, medical aid and food supplies usually do reach those in need, once the frequent obstacles (of a political, financial, religious and, all-too-often, military nature) are overcome.

It is the large scale institutions and interventions that seem so often to be ineffectual—neutered during conception, continually delayed, and acting too late. (The United Nations actually apologized not long ago, acknowledging that its lack of swift action had permitted the slaughter of over half a million people in Rwanda.)

There is something to be learned from a comparison of these results.

Large international governmental organizations become unable to carry out their mandate whenever national interests are allowed to overrule collective good. Representatives of different nations all too often seek results that favour national, rather than global, interests, and this then obstructs unreserved agreement upon a common objective. Speeches are used to obfuscate, delay or prevent, rather than as means to consolidate, collaborate and obtain action. When something is achieved, it is, too frequently, too little and too late.&lt;ref&gt;It is even worse than this, if we are to believe statements made by some of the activist groups who routinely gather to protest at meetings of organizations such as the G8, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, to name a few. The use of large sums of money to bring about global change is said to be doing more harm than good. Furthermore, these and other large multinational organizations, they claim, are making the decisions that local and national governments should be making.&lt;/ref&gt; This is irresponsible behaviour on the part of the organization’s members.&lt;ref&gt;Although the organization’s structure and machinery also have a bearing on this inaction.&lt;/ref&gt; Loyalty to their own national interests causes them to act irresponsibly with respect to the aims of the global organization, and to their own purported reason for participating in that organization.

Smaller organizations, associations and groups generally succeed perhaps because they are able to work more effectively than more expansive ones. More compact groups are not too large to consult local authorities, to collaborate and jointly build a vision of some desirable outcome, and to use the know-how and skills of both giving and receiving groups to solve problems and so obtain success. They use, perhaps unwittingly, techniques that every successful enterprise, small or large, uses. They try to involve as many stakeholders as possible in their attempts to improve the situation, and they collectively find ways to overcome or neutralize subsidiary purposes that might distract or confuse by focusing upon achieving their mutual, overriding, purpose. This is responsible behaviour: responsible to those who support and fund their efforts, to the jointly built ideal, and to those who will ultimately benefit from their actions. Collectively building, holding and valuing a clear vision of the desired result, in my opinion, accounts for much of the success achieved by participants in small-scale endeavours.

Of course, visions of an improved future can also be effective on broader scales, and have been used to unite international interests in the past. When England and her allies were battling the Nazis and Fascism in World War II, indecision and bickering between and among the various leaders likely occurred on numerous occasions and at many levels, but these distractions must have been surmounted. The Allies’ conviction that they were fighting to maintain a civilized society provided a common vision, which would have given all involved the same purpose. It was the common goal that united, providing an integrative reason to ignore parochial differences.&lt;ref&gt;This purpose guided decision making, and, it might be argued, victory was achieved because everyone, from the war-room to the trenches, kept the overall goal firmly in mind. (Perhaps too, the Axis were defeated in part because not everyone fully shared Hitler’s vision.) This was responsible behaviour, and the goal-directed actions of everyone during those WWII years paid for the freedoms many of us now enjoy.&lt;/ref&gt;

One last point on the topic of obtaining success in large and small organizations. There are many instances of leaders turning dying organizations into successes. A common factor in all such turnarounds is that the leaders were attempting to achieve some sort of vision—their vision of how the organization might be improved. The vision, of course, was used to define one or more practical statements of purpose, which were then used to determine intermediate goals, plan activities, motivate, measure successes, etc. Accomplishments such as these suggest that organizations (of any size, international as well as local) benefit from being guided by a consolidating vision.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../../Life And Exploiting/]] pointed out that living entails (and is inseparable from) exploiting the environment for resources. Exploiting therefore, at its roots, is constructive. Indeed, the exploitive ability of the creative&lt;ref&gt;See [[../../Creativity, Free Will, And A Revelation/]].&lt;/ref&gt; has improved the quality of life for billions.&lt;ref&gt;Individual freedom to exploit is the driving force behind capitalism, of course, and restriction of this freedom probably had much to do with the demise of communism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Prosperity does not follow democracy, as has been claimed. It follows the freedom to exploit, and capitalism acknowledges this in the mechanisms it employs. Democracy is needed to curb capitalism’s excesses, and so preserve civilization. Freedom (to exploit) must always take priority because living and exploiting are one and the same thing, as [[../../Life And Exploiting/Exploiting|Exploiting]] explains.&lt;/ref&gt; We should never fear our exploitive nature, but we must manage its excesses.

Over the centuries, we have developed different techniques to curtail humanity’s exploitive excesses, each practice yielding an increased measure of civilization as it took effect. For example, in religious doctrine we command ourselves to love one another and covet not. Progressive nations separate the Church’s power over the mind from the State’s power over the body, to limit the damage that both acting together might do. In the Magna Carta,&lt;ref&gt;The Magna Carta became law in England in 1215. It is the source of legal practices (such as the right to trial by jury) since adopted by countries around the world.&lt;/ref&gt; we placed limits on what a king might bring about. In democratically run countries we expect opposition parties to uncover and expose dishonesty and exorbitance in those we elect to govern. We value freedom of the press for a similar reason. We try to ensure that competition exists in free markets,&lt;ref&gt;Communism, which eliminates competition and free markets, teaches us much about what not to do when running a country.&lt;/ref&gt; because monopolies act to satisfy themselves before satisfying their clientele. We develop and enact laws that constrain the ability of individuals or organizations to excessively exploit others or the world’s resources. We set up courts, build prisons, and enforce contracts. Stockholders and legislators hold meetings and hear from auditors. Most definitely, we have learned that humanity’s ever-present inclination to over-exploit must be controlled, and we have developed specific means by which to do so.

Unfortunately, the world has grown into the idea that the most expedient way for one nation to behave toward another is to “live and let live.” Collectively, nations have come to regard other nations as families regard other families who live in separate houses: we avoid meddling in their internal affairs. Even in extreme situations, when excessive exploitation is not being contained and one country, for example, declares war on another, those outside the war zone usually sit on the sidelines and observe, hoping the conflict will be settled without their involvement.&lt;ref&gt;The West actively opposed the spread of communism (particularly in the last half of the twentieth century—overtly, as in Korea or Vietnam, or covertly, as in many other parts of the world) only because it felt threatened. The United States, through the UN, declared war in the Gulf in 1991, for the same reason.&lt;/ref&gt;

This “hands off” outlook primarily developed because, in the past, the world was large, and distant wars were often little more than topics of detached discussions. However, this is not the case today. Globalization is making the world’s conflicts everyone’s conflicts.

This view that nations should not intervene in the affairs of other nations is slowly changing. We are coming to hold that ethical atrocities (particularly genocide) must be opposed, even when they occur within the boundaries of another nation. We act (although usually not soon enough) if world opinion seems to support an intervention. Presumably this is because such immoral activity, if unopposed, would affect how we view ourselves, and devalue our concept of who we are and what we believe in. We feel a kind of moral obligation to do something, but can’t clearly state why this is so, or what is right for us to do. The universal rationale needed to justify intervention is missing, weak, or unclear.

Section one of this chapter referred to some of the world’s major problems, and to the impression that so many seem to be beyond humanity’s power to prevent. International organizations like the UN are frequently rendered powerless because membership nations lack the moral authority and supporting wherewithal to require other nations to behave responsibly, as various recent (or current) issues relating to countries such as Rwanda, Iraq and North Korea demonstrate.

It is not impossible to influence the internal behaviour of organizations or individuals within any one nation from outside that nation. The clearest evidence of this is the European Union, where Common Market Standards have been developed that constrain a wide variety of activities in member nations. But other examples abound—Interpol and the International Criminal Court being obvious ones. The key to success for any such endeavour is a willingness to participate, brought about by the recognition that participation offers benefits that outweigh the costs.&lt;ref&gt;Benefits the United Nations might bring are effectively neutered because nations hold their country’s welfare to be more important than the world’s welfare. This is surely because the world has no common vision of where its heading.&lt;/ref&gt;

The means of curbing exploitive excesses within the boundaries of any one nation noted in the second paragraph of this section were originally developed, directly or indirectly, from that society’s collective beliefs in what was “right” and “wrong” behaviour. Frequently, this authority stemmed from ideals espoused by the nation’s major religion. But, globally, humanity holds no common religious ideal. A first step in this direction might be the formation of an organization to explore the possible benefits of developing a meta-purpose and defining its specific meaning. Widening the support for such a purpose might become a second step, and using it to unite dissenting nations might follow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Globalization’s expansion is rampant, and its consequences are being felt everywhere. Money sloshes from shore to shore. Crime syndicates become multinationals. Trade patterns gyrate and jobs spring in and out of existence. Immigration and the media blur cultural boundaries. Terrorists infiltrate and create havoc. The World Wide Web provides instant gratification. And the future no longer resembles the past.

Globalization disrupts traditional ideas, challenges cultural identity, exposes acts of degenerate human behaviour that few knew about a generation ago, and clouds our self-images. Our national identities are waning. Once, we looked to the past to define what is important; this is becoming harder and harder to achieve and justify. Old information becomes obsolete, old ways become inefficient or ineffective, and old religions seem unable to cope. Conflicts between ideas, cultures and faiths erupt everywhere.

However globalization is not all doom and gloom. To me, it is little more than the industrial revolution being applied world wide. As it was occurring, the industrial revolution was thought by many to be a detrimental development—introducing new ideas, instituting different methods and means, and forcing people to change their traditional manner of earning a living. Nonetheless, few today would deny that it bought great benefits to humankind. In industrial societies, since the 1870s the average life expectancy has nearly doubled, working hours about halved, years of schooling tripled, and the range of consumer goods immeasurably increased.&lt;ref&gt;See “Is Economic Growth Good for Us?,” a public lecture given by Professor Nick Crafts to the Royal Economic Society, December 4th, 2002.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For background material, see Nicholas Crafts, “UK Real National Income, 1950-1998: Some Grounds for Optimism,” available at http://www.ise.ac.uk/Press/currentNews/crafts.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the industrial revolutions that occurred in various countries were simple compared to globalization because each took place within the confines of a nation’s traditions and laws. No such regularizing principles govern the globe’s activities. So we cope. Each nation does its best to patch up and modify existing structures. Organizations, municipalities and schools educate their employees, citizens and students, showing how different cultures can live together in harmony. Minority opinions are given full weight in crafting legislation. Institutions of global scope such as the International Criminal Court, the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the European Union, and others of their ilk, are established, adjusted and strengthened. Nations meet to draft international standards, revise trading practices,&lt;ref&gt;In the meantime, companies conducting international business frequently opt to be governed by Vienna Sales Convention rules, rather than the often less-rigorous laws of their own country. Many claim that a comprehensive global trading standard is sorely needed.&lt;/ref&gt; debate subsidy elimination, enact pollution-limiting laws, constrain land and ocean harvesting, and so on. Immigration policies are developed, money-laundering controls formulated, child labour laws sanctioned, statements of people’s rights prepared, and more.

Behind the bustle of activity associated with the machinery of globalization one senses an ideal—the unformulated, perhaps unrecognized, notion of what is best for humankind. This notion should be made clear to all, so that it might properly influence what is occurring. For instance, a global legal system is emerging and, certainly, one global legal system will eventually have to be created—but ad hoc, in disconnected units, as is now being done? Sub-committees of various international organizations are hacking out multiple statements of right and wrong, seemingly unconcerned about the need for consistency and unification. This is producing a series of disjointed compromises (few of which will fit seamlessly together) and creating a tangled playground that high-priced lawyers of the future will have to unravel.

Much the same is happening with respect to trading practices and human rights, to name just two examples. This multiple approach toward global standardization may be expeditious, but it clearly cannot be the best way to proceed. Far better would be to first develop a centralizing universal purpose, one that encapsulates a grand vision of what human life is aiming toward. Working backward from a single desired goal is how supporting sub-goals and “right” actions are properly developed; it is the only way international laws and controls can be linked rationally together.

To grow as living organizations (whether as individuals, companies or as nations) we must provide the condition that life demands—the freedom to exploit available resources. And this condition must be fostered world-wide. Encouraging growth within one’s own country while neglecting or suppressing it in others will inevitably generate significant disparities and problems associated with inequality.&lt;ref&gt;“Economic” refugees, much in the news of late, are just one example of what can result.&lt;/ref&gt; Global media networks, which show the world what some, but not all, possess, turn this prediction into a certainty.

A world view of “correct” behaviour and a global legal system are important pieces of the solution, but they cannot be forced upon all nations. Perhaps a world federation with appropriate admission standards might be developed, much like the European Union where countries desirous of participating must first arrange their affairs to conform to certain principles. These admission standards, for reasons that were developed in [[../../Life And Exploiting/]], must centre upon the provision of freedom for individuals and organizations to exploit, but they must also include democratic measures to control exploitive excesses of any kind, wherever they occur, in any of the member countries.

Concomitantly, if we recognize that every individual is a potential contributor to life’s well-being, we must provide as many equalizing social programs as we can afford without jeopardizing the operation of the other (means- and money-generating) conditions. These three ideals—freedom to exploit, democratic control of excesses, and social progress—can be imagined to be corners forming the base of a triangular pyramid. The pyramid’s apex represents the vision that guides our decision making—the vision that tells all where we intend to go, and why these three ideals form the base as our foundation. Hopefully, a federation built in this way, and that begins as a relatively small group of nations, might end up becoming a global amalgamation of civilized countries.

History tells us how we have solved problems of excessive exploitation in the past. There is no reason to think that similar solutions can’t also be utilized in the future, once we learn how to apply them on a larger scale. Legislation enacted by an elected parliament has typically been our method of control, and is likely to remain so. Thus, global law, seeking to regulate nations, their institutions, and their citizens, enacted by elected representatives, must become a reality before a working global civilization can be fully realized.

But how realistic is it to expect any nation to subordinate itself to an international body of law as matters stand today? The United States, Russia, China, or, for that matter, any nation, would never let troops of an international agency, even one seeking to uphold “global law,” intrude upon their institutions without retaliating. In our conventional view of the world, national interests are paramount, and such interference is unthinkable. But it need not always be so.

Willingness to abide by international regulations by all people, at all levels, and in all walks of life, depends upon these individuals believing such precepts to be more important than other desires or demands. A belief that life’s continuation—our children’s children’s future—is more important than our country’s shorter-term goals (or those of any of its organizations), may give rise to such a willingness, were it made the bedrock of global law.

Stable societies eventually enact laws which parallel those taught by their nation’s significant religion. Globalization can only succeed if the same principle is applied globally. Loyal Rue recognizes this in the concluding chapter of his book, ''By the Grace of Guile''. He writes that a “robust moral order” which embodies a “core of (shared) moral values” is needed to attain and sustain social “coherence and stability.”&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue, ''By the Grace of Guile'', 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly so.

One overall vision, generated by a belief in the importance of some meta-purpose, together with an accompanying definition of what this rationally means (the “universal purpose”), must guide global law-making. Only this kind of focusing foundation can integrate, then ensure wide spread recognition and acceptance of the validity of such legislation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What will research into human genetics uncover next? Curbing the growth of (or even curing) many kinds of cancer; correcting conditions that may contribute to heart or lung disease; regenerating organs, tissues and bones on demand; pre-screening ova and sperm to remove genes causing hereditary diseases; all, and much more, may be achievable over the next few decades. Even an extra fifty or one hundred years of life expectancy may be on our grandchildren’s agenda. These advances promise a wonderfully healthy future.

New possibilities resulting from genetic manipulation unfold every week or two. We routinely manufacture plants, adding disease resistance and increasing vitamin content, changing size, shape, colour, scent, texture, height, growth rate—whatever wished for—to suit any market.&lt;ref&gt;For example: algae, used in the biotechnology industry to produce food and dietary supplements, were formerly grown outdoors (because they needed sunlight to grow), where their ponds were readily contaminated. The harvest then had to be put through an expensive purification process. Today, through the addition of one (ex-human) gene, they can be grown in the dark, in sterile vats. Another example: silk (for textile and industrial use) used to be spun from spiders. Today, goats, cloned from gene-altered cells, produce milk from which large quantities of spider’s silk can be extracted.&lt;/ref&gt; We do the same with animals, creating living factories that duplicate top-rate fish, meat, milk, and egg-producers at will.&lt;ref&gt;Cloning animals is not yet a simple process and many clones die from developmental and genetic problems before birth. This may result from the fact that clones are usually produced from DNA taken from adult animals (of proven worth), and a number of these genes will have suffered mutations during their life within the donor cell. Mutations have little effect when involved in the reproduction of just one cell, as occurred before the genes were altered, but can affect the formation of whole organs, and produce malformed or non-functioning systems, when made to program an entire animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, the science of cloning is rapidly improving. Ten or so years ago the success rate for cloning apparently healthy cattle was about one percent. At the time of writing, the success rate is about twelve percent. Further, the premature death of clones that survive birth is now less than twenty percent (normal death rate is about fifteen percent).&lt;/ref&gt; Parents select the sex of their next child. Before long, they will likely be able to pre-determine its size, shape and colour; choose its probable intelligence, artistic aptitude and physical dexterity; and replace genes likely to precipitate diseases or cancers. And, as each gene’s role is deciphered by researchers, humanity treads closer to learning how to control the future of life itself.

New knowledge always brings both opportunities and challenges, and some of our past bio-engineering activities have already caused problems. Plants bred to resist herbicides have crossed with others to produce weeds that cannot be eradicated by conventional methods, and fish engineered to double in size have escaped captivity to breed predators that have decimated wild species, to give only two examples. Once produced, life evolves, and a future spent seeking and eradicating escaped and possibly dangerous genetic misfits can be horrifying to imagine.

There are many questions related to genetic manipulation that should be answered before rushing to apply research’s findings. Perhaps the most important include: What practices should be permitted? How can the applications of each discovery be controlled? and, Who should benefit?

(The question of who should benefit is not a trivial one. Gene treatments that alleviate or cure diseases are turning out to be very expensive, at least currently. If only the wealthy—individuals or nations—are to benefit, then we will have created yet another world-wide inequity that will likely provoke retaliation.)

Part One noted that rational decisions are made by referring to the purpose to be achieved. In making decisions about gene modification, what are we seeking? Do we declare that all knowledge is important, and thereby allow any manner of research, or do we state that some knowledge can be dangerous and try to regulate certain lines of genetic inquiry? Do we decide that only those who can afford it deserve to benefit from research because it is they who have paid, or do we desire the best for all humanity? Is it morally right to allow prospective parents to make any kind of genetic choice they desire concerning their future children, or should there be some universal standards drafted to protect the interests of the unborn?&lt;ref&gt;For instance, a deaf lesbian couple in America recently chose a deaf male friend to father a child who, they were happy to discover, was born deaf. They explained that they wanted the child to enjoy the same experiences that they enjoyed. From their frame of reference this may have merit, but many think that it was not the correct moral decision to make.&lt;/ref&gt;

And, whatever is decided, how will we ever be able to enforce our decisions?

A whole industry is rapidly developing to take advantage of our ability to control life by manipulating genes. Biomedical companies are springing up everywhere, run by entrepreneurs, staffed by well-trained scientists, and funded by venture capitalists, all eager for recognition or gain. Again, this is natural, not wrong; it is an expression of life exploiting a potential opportunity that may bring success to those that exploit. The problem, as usual, is one of control. How does society control an industry whose products need long-term screening, yet whose markets will clamour and pay for immediate gratification? Nations can legislate, but what good might that be when organizations can move offshore anytime they wish? One nation can act responsibly toward its people, however nothing requires all nations to act responsibly toward all people of the world. And the problems that may arise in this arena could be world-threatening.

Developing new life forms, beneficial or otherwise, is becoming a simple task. But it is next to impossible for an outside agency to detect the covert pursuits of another country until too late, as Russia, Afghanistan, North Korea and other nations, have taught us. There may be several ways to counter such activity, but one stands above others in effectiveness—that derived from individuals within an organization whose moral sensitivity is affronted by suspect endeavours. Disaffected individuals are prime sources of intelligence and counter-activity.&lt;ref&gt;We see such a global awareness in public reactions to the events of September 11, 2001. People everywhere are thinking more carefully about the consequences of terrorist actions. Terrorist organizations today, and the groups that support them, have less credibility and more to fear, than used to be the case. Much of this counterforce stems from the general public’s new awareness, and the support it generates for the implementation of anti-terrorist actions.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, individuals have different concepts of moral correctness.

As noted in [[../../Revelations And Conversions/]], most ideas about morality stem from religions, and most religions have as their focus individual benefit, not that of the community. Consequently, how human activity in one location is affecting distant communities and different life forms is seldom considered until the damage has been done if it is considered at all. A global religion would generate a global awareness and conscience. While developing a global religion is a tall order, as a first and more practical step, developing a universal purpose is possibly the best countermeasure we may currently be able to adopt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The world is plagued with problems. That a universal purpose may help us to more effectively address some of them may seem a far-fetched idea, but those who lead organizations and nations already know that people will strive to attain a purpose they have come to believe in and consider important. Perhaps the benefits to be obtained from a universal purpose (as sketched in this and the previous chapter) are overstated, but we won’t know the true extent of its possibilities until we have tried. As the saying goes, “nothing ventured, nothing gained.” Can we really continue the way we have been, letting the winds of chance blow us hither and thither? Should each nation continue acting independently and as they wish? Or are we ready to think collectively as we shape the future our grandchildren will inherit?

If the idea of developing a universal purpose seems implausible, the idea of eventually developing a universal religion based upon this purpose must seem preposterous. How could anyone think that adding a new religion to the existing mix might simplify the situation when religions themselves often contribute to—and may even create—some of the very problems we are trying to solve?

The idea of deliberately trying to develop a new religion might have seemed nonsense when first opening this book. But, if it did so, perhaps this was because so little has been generally understood about how the founders of our various religions obtained their ideas, and why those who followed these leaders created religions. Religions are commonly thought to be based upon ideas that came from a god, but one of this book’s purposes has been to show that this may not have been what actually happened.

Religions are social tools, designed and fostered quite deliberately by human beings to ameliorate social ills. What was done with success in the past can be done again with success in the future. Please re-assess my contention that humanity needs a universal religion. Is it not actually quite a plausible suggestion? And would developing a religion that is consistent with our current understanding of reality actually be so difficult to do? I do not think so.

How we might begin to undertake such a task is discussed in the next two chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Currently our “universal religion-to-be” is an undefined figment; it needs substance to give it shape. Just what is entailed in supporting life’s journey to possess omnipotent abilities? What moral injunctions might be imposed by adoption of such a doctrine? This chapter begins a discussion of questions such as these.

Because moral decisions made within a religious framework are intended to further the attainment of a religion’s purpose, then moral codes must be logically linked to, and derivable from, this purpose. When this connection is not readily evidenced or traceable, behavioural codes appear to be adrift and may fall open to different interpretations. Moreover, various codes may well be at odds with one another, for without sound links connecting them to the desired purpose any injunction may be embodied. In short, causal relationships are as important in religion as they are in science and for exactly the same reason: the universe is causal, and correct explanations will bear witness to this causality. Similarly, correct behaviour will also be causal—the event sought determines the causal action required (i.e., “correct behaviour” is purpose directed behaviour). Further, our rational minds need the ability to cross-check their analyses, because they have evolved to operate this way through being successful in a rational universe. Causal links provide this ability.

But until the precisely worded universal purpose is defined, we must work with our proposed meta-purpose concept.&lt;ref&gt;See [[../Introduction to Part Four/]] for a distinction between these two terms.&lt;/ref&gt; This renders the process more complex; moral behaviours derived from a meta-purpose rather than a universal purpose will almost always be imprecise, and some may be completely off the mark. This chapter simply serves to illustrate how a “moral” direction might be deduced—a feat that will be more judiciously accomplished once a universal purpose has been defined. Thus, in that they serve only as examples, my derivations in this chapter are of limited practical application other than as a spring board for further discussion.

We again set out from the beginning by restating the facts that form the basis of our current understanding of reality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The facts of life presented in earlier chapters can be summarized as follows.

Life is a process whereby chemical complexes exploit their environments to obtain energy and resources. Living and exploiting are inseparable activities, present at the base level in all life forms. Replication is a secondary function that (if sexual, rather than simply division) facilitates diversity. Diversity helps life to survive in a changing environment.

The elemental nature of life’s underlying process (chemical processes exploiting their environment) implies that it can, and will, arise anywhere, whenever suitable conditions exist. Once begun, life continues until all usable energy differences are exhausted; ceasing prior to this point would simply leave niches where new life could arise and evolve.

Sporadic mutations that improve or have no negative effect on life’s ability to successfully exploit environmental resources are carried through into subsequent generations.

Living organisms add new structures and cell processes to those they already possess, making entities more complex as time goes by. This creates an evolutionary trend toward intelligence because, to become beneficial, compounded body augmentations require more elaborate controlling abilities. Furthermore, since energy-exploitation becomes more difficult as energy resources are consumed, the very act of living creates conditions that necessitate enhanced problem-solving ability. That is, declining resources (and challenges of any kind) beget increased mental ability or intelligence.

Life learns how to exploit and control its environment by perceiving, investigating, understanding, then utilizing the relationships that exist between objects and events. This is possible because the universe is causally constructed.

Causality’s chain seems to break, from an insider’s point-of-view, at the physical and temporal boundaries of our universe. Internal causality cannot be connected to anything external to this universe because the properties of that which lies beyond (if anything does exist outside) cannot be understood from a position within.

There are many other important aspects to the nature of life and the universe but those listed above will suffice for the purposes of this chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One vitally important fact is missing from the above list: humans are not the whole of life. With the meta-purpose we have chosen, it is our relationship to life itself that determines “moral” behaviour. Thus, we must carefully examine what this relationship entails.

Humans are just one species, one twig of a giant tree, and this places us in a rather precarious position. As a twig, we are not only beset by the storms and upheavals that continuously affect and change our physical environment, we are further subjected to the demands that the tree itself places upon us.

Life is our father and mother. Life produced us. It nurtures us, and it will absorb us once we die. Life creates and maintains our support system, and structures much of our playground. Life itself is the totality&lt;ref&gt;James Lovelock, in ''The Ages of Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Earth'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1990) shows that life modifies its environment, eventually reaching a state of equilibrium when energy consumption balances waste disposal. This results in an interdependency that can be considered to act as a single entity. Eventually, one supposes, this interdependency between living and non-living might encompass the whole of the universe.&lt;/ref&gt; to which we owe allegiance, and to which we should be paying most attention. Living life—not some imaginary after-death life—is our true supersystem.

Knowing this, I ask myself what subsystem behaviours might such a supersystem&lt;ref&gt;See [[../../Gödel’s Theorem, General Systems Theory, and The Conservation Laws/]] for a background discussion of terms such as subsystem and supersystem.&lt;/ref&gt; reward, and what might it punish?&lt;ref&gt;Forgive my personifying life by saying that it will “reward” and “punish” behaviours (here and in later sections). Doing so makes various points easier to express.&lt;/ref&gt;

To my way of thinking, the following statements are self-evident in the context of the supersystem “Life.” (The word “Life,” although from our perspective is currently constrained to that which exists on our planet, has been capitalized in several places throughout the remainder of the book to signify that the context applies wherever life exists.)

* Subsystems (including humans) will be tolerated by their encompassing supersystem (Life) as long as they do not hinder its continuance. (For instance, plants will provide oxygen and convert sunlight into energy forms that we and other living entities can consume—as long as we do not eliminate them.)
* Life “punishes” entities that disrupt its existence or growth. (For instance, discharging pollutants diminishes the abundance and variety of food producers, eventually creating a future that becomes one of subsisting rather than of plenty.)
* Life “rewards” entities that foster its spread and development. (For instance, enlarging rain forest acreage increases the abundance and variety of food and other resources that it supplies.)

(To best appreciate these points, think of the long-term implications of any endeavour, human or otherwise, that impacts upon some part of the ecosystem, then imagine what might happen if the scope and depth of this impact were to be greatly increased. Projecting to the limit often clarifies what may well be happening, unnoticed, on a smaller scale or behind the scenes.)

There are likely several other truths about the relationship between humans (or any species) and our supersystem that deserve to be uncovered and discussed, but those stated above are sufficient to move to the next step.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When I consider our relationship to the supersystem Life as we experience it on Earth, I find that Life is actually behaving very much in a traditional “god-like” manner. It is effectively “judging” what its subsystems—including humans—do, and it subsequently rewards or punishes their behaviour. These rewards and punishments are meted out continuously, in various forms and locations, over short and long time-spans. Humans are learning to recognize these repercussions, but we still have a long way to go before we learn to respect—or even to expect—Life’s judgements.

However, we can choose to behave in a manner that allows us to benefit from our relationship to our supersystem Life. For instance, we can reduce the harm we inflict on our supersystem by ensuring our discharges are benign. This would precipitate the reward of having more resources—food and oxygen, for instance—made available as greater diversity (and numbers) of other life forms survive and thrive. Or, as another example, we can increase rather than decrease the world’s rain forest coverage, thus increasing the variety and number of benefits-to-life that accompany biological diversity. We can choose to behave in such ways (and many of us do), but the activities of numerous others, some for profit some simply to survive, are hastening the demise of significant portions of Life’s supersystem.&lt;ref&gt;In this book’s scheme of things, what happens on Earth affects the larger supersystem of Life within the universe only as much or as little as it ultimately contributes to the formation and actions of oB. If descendants of humans will some day explore the universe to eradicate all living things, then destroying ourselves now to prevent such an occurrence might be the best contribution we could make.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons humans do not all act in ways that benefit Life are many and varied, but two are particularly significant to our discussions. First, as previously stated, we are only just recognizing, and do not yet fully comprehend, the fact that humans are simply a processing subsystem, subordinate to and dependent upon, a larger system. Second, failing to recognize our dependency, few of us value it appropriately.

There are also degrees of valuing. We can give a wary nod to an idea, or we can embrace it wholeheartedly. Thus, we could pay lip-service to the idea of Life being our supersystem and say, “sure, I think this idea is important,” but carry on as before—and nothing changes. Or we could say, “yes, the ecosystem is very important; I’ll be careful not to pollute,” and start, for example, participating in the community’s recycling program—producing a little change. Or we could say, “let me consider more fully this relationship between humans and Life,” then seek others already active in this area to investigate what can be done. In the latter situation, actions having greater impact might result. The degree to which we value the relationship between ourselves and Life affects the future that all life (not just our descendants) will experience on this planet. And while our effects on life’s future are typically minimal, the ramifications of humanity’s actions are increasingly far-reaching.

Well, let’s think about what insights might be gained were we to recognize that our supersystem’s journey toward eventual possession of omnipotent abilities is the very same journey that all species as subsystems are undertaking, albeit that each will travel only an infinitesimal part of the way.

If we were to regard Life’s continued evolution as an activity well worth supporting, and, particularly, if we were to use this “meta-purpose” to define the universal purpose that guides our moral decision making, then a whole new range of behaviours would become valued. We can use the ideas listed in section two above to educe what these behaviours would be. We can even make moral judgements and infer what types of activities should be considered “right” and which should be considered “wrong” within the confines of such a value system.

When I attempt this, I find the following.
 
* It is right to learn, to support others’ learning, to try to understand how and why the universe and its contents are the way they are—because Life lives and advances by learning and by putting this knowledge to use.
* It is right to pass on this knowledge, to store it for future generations, to link knowledge together in theories, to find new avenues of thought—because Life has evolved intelligence as a helping mechanism, and knowledge is the food that nurtures capacity, intelligence and understanding.
* It is right to make use of this knowledge, to expand our limits, our control and our ability to exploit—because Life lives, grows, reproduces and becomes richer in every aspect, by using the energy and resources it has learned to extract from its environment.
* But it is equally right, and necessary, to control excessive exploitations—because these harm Life’s future. Determining where to draw the line between helpful exploitation and harmful excesses is, and always will be, a difficult undertaking, but one which must be made a priority if civilization is to continue.
* And, it is right to help other humans and other life forms—because Life’s progress may benefit from the contributions of others as much as, or even more than, it does from ours.

These behaviours (and many others, of course) would be “right” for any living entity in this universe to practice, simply because actions of this kind help Life to actualize its potential. In response, the supersystem “rewards” subsystems for supporting its operations. That such actions are also “right” for humans to practice because they help each of us attain our own potential is likely to be secondary to Life’s progress (although it usually is very important to our personal well-being). That which helps Life, helps us. The order of importance must be this way around, not the other, because humans are a subordinate system. What are to be considered “right” actions, in the logical system of morals we are developing, must always be determined by putting Life’s advancement, not human advancement, first.

With this process of reasoning in place, new behavioural boundaries (i.e., rights and wrongs) might be established. Some of those newly “recognized” above as being “right” to practice have been ignored or even discouraged within traditional religions, although others have always been important. For instance, before now there has not been a rational explanation of why teaching and learning are so important, such “right” functions.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, learning was made suspect in some western societies. The very roots of Christian theology warn against knowledge. The story of Adam and Eve declares that their innocence was lost when they ate fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and their punishment was the loss of immortality, for themselves and their descendants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have a personal experience to recount that relates to this matter. For a few months, almost five decades ago, I taught a class in a village elementary school in England. One day I asked the Headmaster why it was always the same few children who stayed at home whenever they had the slightest sniffle. He replied, “Oh, they’re Catholics, and they have a Catholic doctor. He tells them to stay at home. He doesn’t believe in too much education.” Of course, this might be just the Headmaster’s bigotry showing through, and the doctor might have wanted to reduce the spread of infection. But, since medical training in England is secular, and non-Catholic doctors did not tell children in their care to stay at home whenever they had a sniffle, perhaps the Head had reason for his statements. He may have been basing his remark on his many past experiences with a variety of doctors. (On the other hand, one example proves nothing; this particular doctor may have been an exception. However, I have vague memories of reading other anecdotes that suggest he wasn’t.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The majority of religions have not valued learning for everyone, perhaps because to do so might teach that reality’s truth—the practical kind that we use everyday—has been discovered by humans over centuries of hard inquiry into the nature of things. It is not “revealed” by some interceding god.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, just as we can now clearly judge learning to be right, we can now immediately state why it is wrong to restrict knowledge, to burn books, to tell lies, to spread hatred, to prevent or limit the development of other life forms.

If, as a community, we were to adopt the practice of rationally deducing moral behaviour from the purpose we elect to support, we would, after sustained effort, eventually be able to justify our morality to any intelligent being (including those beyond our planet). Our existing moral systems would probably become subsumed within the rational one, and some components of the former might in due time simply fade away.&lt;ref&gt;Of course, rationality does not prevail where emotions, cultures, traditions, or any other such influences, dominate. Some, as we know, would say that their God has other intentions in mind, and that these should take priority over any man-made efforts—but we have already traced that contention to its source.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any rational being can deduce a moral code from a statement of desired purpose together with knowledge of the environment containing the criteria a successful solution must meet. If enough of humanity chose to value the living environment more than any possible dead one, then we could combine efforts to logically educe what behaviours should be called “morally wrong” or “morally right.” Given enough time, we should be able to formulate a set of moral statements, each element of which would be traceable back to its origins. This latter feature is important, as it ensures that each assertion is adjustable should new information or understanding make correction necessary.&lt;ref&gt;“Correcting” views featured in existing religions pertaining to any moral issue (homosexuality, for instance) is often very difficult: it should be relatively simple in a rationally constructed religion.&lt;/ref&gt; And we would know what is to be gained, both immediately and in the distant future, by acting in accordance with these values.

Until we reach this stage, our beliefs regarding which behaviours are “right” or “wrong” stem only from what we have been taught by our parents, teachers, or religion’s authorities. That is, until we embrace logically deduced moralities, there is no rational way to independently verify the truth of such statements, and no straight-forward method to incorporate changes resulting from improved knowledge. (Christians, for instance, accept the authority of the Commandments on faith. These cannot be modified even if circumstances should so merit.)

With a guiding universal purpose statement and its derived set of moral codes in place, it would no longer be necessary to separate religious thought from rational or scientific thought. Causal links and logical deductions could be made in both domains, with the two becoming inter-dependent and mutually supporting. The data, their sources, the need to inquire, and the methods used when investigating, would become identical for science and religion, unifying these two great endeavours. Effectively, they become one and the same search for reality’s truth.

Moreover, we would know that any intelligent living entity, anywhere in the universe, would be able to uncover rational reasons to value and support Life reaching its full potential, and thus develop the same ethical standards as we support. Rationality provides the means to develop a truly universal religion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Even these first few steps in our exploration of a possible future morality move us far enough along to begin an examination of some of the contentious moral problems we are facing in the world today. I will try to illustrate how rational connections might be made between a few current ethical issues and a desire to support Life’s continued evolution. The examples I have chosen to discuss include killing, some aspects of personal freedom, and genetic manipulation.

But, before we can begin, several cautionary points need be made. First, possessing the “potential to contribute” to Life’s advancement needs much careful consideration when exploring moral positions. It is possible to state that all living things have this, and that their potential to contribute should never be limited. But this creates an impossible situation—eating kills what is consumed and moving crushes entities underfoot. Any kind of exploitation reduces potential in exploited arenas (raising it in others), but, as discussed, life and exploitation cannot be separated. In like vein, it could be argued that no individual’s action should be curtailed&lt;ref&gt;We are approaching this state in some “emancipated”  parts of the world, where individual freedom and universal equality are becoming sacrosanct principles. The first is interpreted to mean that anything (not harming others) is permitted; the second equates to “what you have, I must be able to have.” Combine both, and we end up with garbage-strewn streets that disgust visitors, and gay bishops that split religions.&lt;/ref&gt; because any action may hold the future possibility of “contributing” to Life’s advancement. “Potentiality” is clearly a very important concept, and the meaning, scope and depth of this term need defining and limiting before any significant work on moral behaviour can be advanced. I have mostly ignored the importance of any “potential” contribution in the following subsections (largely because I have not the ability nor inclination to examine such a difficult issue) and leave it as a task that others might perform.

Second, the discussions that follow attempt to show how a code of moral behaviour that relates to human interactions might be developed. It does not explore how humans might appropriately behave towards animals, plants, or other non-human life forms. Certainly, any moral code that proposes supporting Life’s evolutionary journey should detail appropriate behaviour toward any and all kinds of life—more work left for others to consider.

Third, accepting Life’s possible evolution to become oB as the meta-purpose we support (made useful by sculpting from it a definition of a universal purpose) means that decisions would be made toward furthering the attainment of that meta-purpose. We would value new discoveries, new knowledge, new understandings, and the increased ability to control each might bring, because each paves tiny sections of the highway to Life’s future. Currently, we all “contribute” to helping life achieve its “meta-purpose,” and we do so never learning the ultimate significance of our contribution. (In fact, any lengthy periods during which we do not contribute, may, in some of us, create the feeling that our lives were becoming meaningless.) But once we had decided to use the meta-purpose to guide our morality, our “moral duty” becomes much clearer; we would know we were acting irresponsibly whenever we behaved in a manner that undermined its attainment.

Thus it would appear that one takes on certain responsibilities when adopting Life’s meta-purpose as one’s own.&lt;ref&gt;This is the mechanism that underlies religion’s value in society: social tensions and disagreements are reduced when everyone values the same religious goal—because each undertakes the responsibility of following the same code of behaviour.&lt;/ref&gt; The notions of “responsibility” and “contributing” lie at the heart of our attempt to define a moral code and I will be referring to them from time to time below. However, these terms should also be carefully defined—another difficult task that perhaps others might undertake.

Lastly, teams of experts working jointly on individual issues would be needed to develop rational connections and usable codes of behaviour once a universal purpose had been defined; the sub- sections below are simply the product of my mind’s undeniably biased constructs. They are included to demonstrate how a desire to support the attainment of some purpose might be used to determine “right” (and therefore also “wrong”) behaviour. It is clear that this determination must be possible, as everyone of us does exactly this each time we decide how to act to solve problems standing in the way of completing our daily tasks. However, it will likely soon be equally clear that I am not the person to join any of those hypothetical teams!

Now to the examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The rationale for stating that it would be wrong to kill an individual is easy to state: any individual’s actions may contribute to the objective of supporting Life’s continued evolution, thus each life is valuable and should be preserved. Killing an individual prevents that individual from contributing (discounting the body’s store of nutrients and energy that inevitably recycle and do contribute). However, this seemingly simple premise hides a few surprises, the first stemming from how we define an individual.

Two separate cells, the sperm and ovum, before joining to form a zygote do not constitute an individual. They each contain part of the potential to form an individual,&lt;ref&gt;Just as every other DNA-containing cell does, if cloning is included in our considerations.&lt;/ref&gt; but they have not yet become an individual. Our new morality would therefore likely state that there is nothing “wrong” in killing these cells. And life routinely does exactly that—our bodies produce many more sperm and ova than are needed or used.

An embryo, then a fetus before birth, is also a “potential” individual, not yet able to contribute directly to Life’s evolution (although it may very well be inspiration for some of the contributions made by its parents). Thus, our rational new religion would probably rule that it is not wrong to kill developing embryos at any stage.&lt;ref&gt;There may be numerous reasons why an abortion might be logically wise. Examples include: when the developing fetus puts the mother at risk (the mother is contributing to Life, and so takes priority over a non-contributing fetus); when the fetus is abnormal to the point that it could not survive birth; or when conditions mean that a baby could not be fed or maintained, and so on. (The last example suggests that some pre-existing external factors are wrong.) Abortion, then, may not be a mortal sin in our developing system of morality (although actually having an abortion might well be emotionally impossible).&lt;/ref&gt;

This may be its rational declaration, but human emotions would most often have it otherwise. Few parents would want to harm or kill their children-to-be. It would feel emotionally wrong to do so.

Our new religion may even come to the same conclusion about killing infants, as well as those individuals that no longer possess the ability to contribute, by arguing along the following lines.

Newborns are potential individuals, not individuals as we typically understand fully developed adults to be. Newly born babies exist as separate beings, having wonderfully formed bodies but relatively empty minds. Empty, that is, of most of the stored memories, links and thoughts that will rapidly form to produce an individual in its own right. Our new rational religion would likely not call a physical body, mostly empty of mind, an individual, and would probably not state that it is “wrong” to kill such an entity. But, of course, we do state that it is wrong.

We denounce killing newborns for emotional, cultural, and legal reasons. It feels wrong to kill children of any age, and the law in recognition of this usually declares that newborns become individuals at birth. Clearly we will continue to state that killing newborns is wrong, but it is possible that our new religion may not actually state that it is “morally wrong” to do so (for instance, if “potential to contribute” is given minimal weight by the religion’s developers).

A similar argument applies to the way we regard mature individuals. In the grand view of Life’s endeavour, the individual is everything and nothing. It is everything while it is contributing to Life’s journey; it is nothing when it has made its contribution. During our lifetime, we all, knowingly or unknowingly, strive to support Life’s journey. We all do our best to learn, to grow, to create, to procreate, to feel that we are living a productive and meaningful life. These are innate behaviours that are carried out daily—part and parcel of being a living entity. We may even accept them as responsibilities. But, as we end our days, with our physical and mental powers deteriorating, we become free of this duty to contribute. Our new moral code is likely to state that at this stage, those who so choose have every right to seek death when they are ready for it, be it self-awarded or assisted.

The same contention might well apply when a person’s brain becomes damaged or debilitated by disease or accident. As long as there is the slightest chance that the individual will recover, to be able to contribute once more, then our new moral system would probably rule that it is wrong to kill or to sanction suicide for that individual. But this ruling could change as conditions worsen, as death becomes imminent, or as living becomes unbearably painful. For such individuals who will never be further able to contribute, our new religion would probably state that euthanasia is not morally wrong. However, as we may know, even under such circumstances it is next to impossible to kill someone we love. Our emotions (quite apart from our laws) make it very hard to hasten their death. But our new religion would now possibly offer consolation, not condemnation, were we to do so.

Using similar arguments, our new religion would probably tell us that it is irrational to simply declare abortion or euthanasia wrong, and also that there are times when we may morally allow compassion to rule.

Thus we begin to see that morality would likely differ from what it is now. Our new religion would clearly separate rational, emotional and legal arguments, allowing us to frankly examine the contribution each makes. It would open the way for our old, sometimes simplistic, sometimes cruel, laws to be reconsidered, and perhaps, if thought necessary, eventually modified. (Indeed, its construction would force us to reassess our understanding of what it is to be a thinking human).

On the surface, our new religion may seem hard and cold, ruling by logic first, and only allowing emotions to be considered second. But our proposed religion must be so constructed because the universe is so constructed, and because life evolves in obedience to the laws of physics that govern and define the universe and all its contents. While animal behaviour is largely emotionally governed—animalistic—because it has no other option, humans have gained the ability to be objective. Humans, in following their minds’ attempts to think rationally, also try to behave rationally, and the two foremost dimensions of humanity, emotion and logic, are often at war in the effort. Our new religion, if developed rationally, should allow us to separate, then balance, emotion and reason, giving us tools to assess both before making any decision. We would no longer be commanded by dogma, emotions or beliefs, but by logical rationality. Surely, this is what our modern minds are asking us to institute when they react against the occasional religious (or parental, legal, employment, or other) requirement that seems irrational.

There are other “wrongs” to reconsider, for instance, the rationale for stating that birth control is morally wrong. If circumstances dictate that additional progeny will harm, rather than help, Life’s continued evolution on this planet, then birth control would necessarily be considered by our new religion sensible and “right.” What value to Life would there be in saturating an overpopulated environment with individuals if nothing remains for them but an arduous search for nutrients and niches where precious few are to be found? When would such individuals ever find the time, or develop the ability, to contribute? Of course, there will always be many outstanding individuals who will do exactly that in any population. Perhaps one percent, or, say, five, would surmount their disadvantageous surrounding conditions. Birth control, some might contend, would have denied Life their contributions. But that argument ignores the possibility that, if this world was less densely and more equitably populated, then a great many more than one or five percent would be in a position to contribute. Of course, it is not simply a matter of quantity, it is more one of quality. But, again, there are many more opportunities for quality to emerge in an educated and liberated environment than there are in a poverty-stricken or hopelessly overcrowded one.

(The overwhelming need for world population controls is one of the implications of a report written by Mathis Wackernagel et al.&lt;ref&gt;To obtain the report, “Ecological Footprints of Nations,” see http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/rio/focus/report/english/footprint.&lt;/ref&gt; This report discusses the compilation and findings of human “ecological footprint” statistics [the planetary acreage needed to sustain human life at its current rate of resource usage]. Two of its findings are particularly relevant to this discussion. First, that humans, on average, expend thirty per cent more than nature is able to sustain (and this figure is increasing rather than decreasing). And, second, that the resources of five more Earths would be needed for everyone to live at the average current North American rate. Clearly, the majority can never live as North Americans now live. But all could, should they so desire, were there fewer for the planet to nourish. One billion people is about this planet’s limit, if the North American way of life is universally accorded. However, the world’s population is currently over six billion, and could reach ten billion in thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;For a statistical calculation of current and projected future world population numbers (as well as past figures), visit the website http://www.ibiblio.org/lunarbin/worldpop.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Another issue to contemplate is capital punishment. As above, the criteria used to weigh the merits of this practice would need to be reconsidered. Under the rationality of our new religion, anyone able to “contribute” should be allowed to live. While we may want retribution for heinous crimes committed, this is an emotional, not reasoned, reaction. However, if an individual was clearly unable to “contribute,” if serial killing (for example) was his or her sole motivating interest, then there may be no rational reason (nor religious, for our religion would be rational) to let that individual continue living. The problem then, as always, becomes one of judging whether or not enough is known to be certain about the true state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;This may soon cease to be a problem, if MRI screening is used to examine the brains of people suspected of having knowledge about criminal activities.&lt;/ref&gt;

Our proposed new religion tells us why individuals are important—because each individual has the potential to make a difference. He or she can uncover new facts,  find new linkages and applications, discover new meanings, and perhaps augment Life’s ability to control. This is why each and every individual matters. Embryos and fetuses before birth cannot contribute in this manner, infants in their first few months, and some individuals, perhaps in the closing days of their life or if criminally insane, cannot contribute. In these circumstances our new religion would likely tell us that killing is not morally wrong (although it is unlikely to decree that it is morally right). Our new doctrine would probably conclude that such individuals are of no relevance as they are and offer no guidance at all. (This, at least, would free us from religious censure if we choose to follow the dictates of our emotions.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Individuals have to be free to explore and exploit their environment if they are to maximize their ability to contribute to Life. This suggests that the freedom of individuals should not be restricted in any way (provided their actions are not restricting the ability of others to contribute, of course). And this implies that individuals should be free to act in ways that might harm themselves.

The over-riding necessity for individual freedom affects how a rational religion might view private activities. For instance, individuals abusing drugs may be acting irrationally, and they may eventually suffer for doing so, but our new religion would likely not consider this action morally “wrong.” Who knows what discoveries, what new insights and understandings, might be realized were a drug-induced state to open neural channels routinely by-passed in everyday thinking? (And there have been many instances when drugs have enhanced an artist’s creativity, and others now reap benefits from that individual’s experience.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, ''Confessions of an English Opium Eater'' by Thomas De Quincey. Samuel Taylor Coleridge is said to have written the symbolic poem, ''Kubla Khan'', in an opium-induced state. (He began taking opium to reduce his pain from rheumatism, but eventually became addicted.) See Marcus Boon, ''The Road Of Excess: A History Of Writers On Drugs'' (Boston: Harvard University Press, 2002) for many other examples.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Many countries legislate against the recreational use of drugs. Clearly we need laws that protect immature individuals from harm but legislation itself will not accomplish this end. Declaring drug use to be illegal simply hands drug control (and its resulting profits) to criminal organizations.&lt;ref&gt;We can’t even stop recreational drug use in our prisons. What does this say about the kind of controls that would have to be put in place (and, presumably, about the people who want to put them there) to completely stop drug use in the “free” world outside of prison?&lt;/ref&gt; Their activities simply make matters worse,&lt;ref&gt;This topic has been the subject of an extensive, award-winning, inquiry by Dan Gardner. See “Losing the War on Drugs,” at http://www.mapinc.org/gardner.htm (the Media Awareness Project website).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
See also ''Sensible Solutions to the Urban Drug Problem'', a series of policy papers released August 22, 2001 by the Fraser Institute, which claim that the war on drugs is lost. The series is retrievable by following links starting at http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/publications.&lt;/ref&gt; as prohibition tried to teach us.

Our new religion would state that individuals must have the freedom to experiment knowledgeably and to face the ensuing consequences. This is how every animal learns: they act, analyze the results of their action, then modify, cease, or repeat the action, learning and developing physical and mental skills as they do so. Education, not legislation, properly limits the harm that ill-considered experimentation can do. That occasionally people die through their own careless actions is distressing, but we cannot logically expect this to never happen, even were we able to foresee and forbid all possible harmful actions. We need to teach, for example, why wearing bicycle helmets and seat belts is important, not legislate then spend money, time and resources enforcing their use. Laws and their enforcement simply remove degrees of the self-responsibility that all individuals must possess if they are to mature.&lt;ref&gt;The reason such laws are enacted, I suspect, has as much to do with reducing the nation’s medical costs and retaining votes as it has to do with saving lives. Would it not be better to proportionately reduce—or even deny—insurance payments, medical treatments, and other benefits, to the degree individuals consciously contributed to their own injury? (Some doctors already do this: they refuse to treat lung cancer sufferers who continue to smoke. And am I the only person who thinks that those whose willful carelessness contributes to their own downfall deserve to some degree what they get?)&lt;/ref&gt;

A great deal of this education can, and should, be performed by the primary authority figures in our lives, our parents. This assumes first that the parent figures have been retrained in the traditional moral values and respect. In today's world, where social workers step in to prevent authority figures even directing children in the art of creating respect, the parents must be provided the training and freedom to raise their offspring in a manner that is conducive to creating social harmony. Within three generations we can start to move towards a society that fosters mutual respect, both within a society and internationally.

Creating laws that take away common freedoms, as opposed to major crimes, only create disharmony, fear and fat pockets for the lawyers. Teaching self responsibility for behaviour towards others will quickly spread through a society and create a peer pressure on those who would rule the world (or their own little patch)to conform to a higher moral order or be ex-communicated by their own society.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Under our new system of belief, all avenues of research would likely be inherently “good” and “right” because Life uses knowledge to gain control of needed resources, and control opens new avenues of development and leads to evolutionary enhancements. Of course, new knowledge carries with it the potential for doing wrong, just as every iota of understanding has always done. But it also carries with it an equal and opposite potential for doing right.

Genes control almost everything in nature, from behaviour (fidelity, for instance, has been transferred from prairie voles to mice by gene manipulations at Emory University), to longevity (the average lifespan of a fruit fly has been doubled, from 37 to 70 days, with no apparent diminishment of life quality, by rearranging genes). Since many genes that perform basic functions are identical across different species (including between plants and animals) it will not be long before scientists will be able to manipulate human genes towards progeny exhibiting almost any trait desired.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Nash, born in the United States in 2000, has been called the first designer baby. He was conceived specifically so that his six-year-old sister, who would otherwise die from Fanconi anemia, could be given stem cells from his umbilical cord. Several eight-cell embryos were screened and one that matched the sister’s tissues but did not contain the disease-causing genes was implanted. (Geneticists find that 75% of all embryos screened for chromosomal disorders are abnormal; an explanation for why so many embryos abort spontaneously.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments are grappling with where to draw the line when it comes to conducting genetic research. Some state that, for example, organs such as replacement ears or hearts may be grown from embryonic stem cells otherwise destined never to develop; others decry this. Most are inclined to say that embryonic cells should not be deliberately grown to obtain stem cells,&lt;ref&gt;This debate may soon become unnecessary, because stem cells can now be grown from embryos created by parthenogenesis, whereby an egg cell is chemically induced to develop into an embryo (i.e., no sperm cell is required). Such embryos occur in nature but fail to live beyond a few divisions. Parthenogenetically created monkey stem cells have been used to grow functioning heart and brain cells.&lt;/ref&gt; presumably because they do not want to be forced to decide exactly when human life begins, or to reopen debates related to abortion.&lt;ref.Politicians seldom like to discuss ethical or moral matters. This may be because they cannot predict how expressing possibly contentious views might turn voters’ opinions in the next election.&lt;/ref&gt; Querying the universal purpose definition should advise us how to proceed.

Almost all countries, at the moment, seem to contend that cloning humans is wrong, but I do not understand why. We have never hesitated to clone other animals and plants; how, precisely, are humans different? The desire to support the attainment of a universal purpose should help societies determine the most appropriate standpoint to take. And, as has been pointed out earlier, if a single global law is needed to simplify enforcement, then our best chance of defining one that might be respected has to be through the development of a supported universal purpose.

Xenotransplantation (i.e., transferring cells or tissues from one species to another) will probably be considered dangerous for many years to come, on practical rather than moral grounds. Viral fragments from one species can combine with genes in another and have devastating consequences. For example, tissues preserved in Alaskan permafrost of a woman who died from the Spanish flu epidemic (which killed over forty million people in 1918-19) showed when analyzed that the flu was a virus formed when sections of two genes, one normally occurring in humans, the other normally occurring only in pigs, somehow became spliced together.

Another issue that currently presents moral challenges is gene patenting. Universities and organizations conducting biological research have been patenting gene-altered plants and animals for decades.&lt;ref&gt;However, when the courts ruled that the Harvard Mouse (a genetically altered mouse much used in cancer research) was property, they were stating that companies can claim ownership of newly created living organisms, another potential moral minefield. Does a genetically altered human baby become a company’s property now?&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly, private investors and venture capitalists would generally not fund research if there were no prospects of financial gain. Sales of any resulting products or technologies return funds to investors, pay for past and future research, buy needed equipment, etc., but only while patents protect a company’s proprietary rights. This money comes from those who can afford to buy the product, and therein lies the rub. Drugs that help AIDS sufferers, for example, are expensive to create, and this effectively restricts their distribution and use to wealthy countries. This places two organizing systems, an economic one and a moral one, in direct conflict.

The world’s economic decisions are made to realize economic goals; the world’s moral decisions are made to realize religious goals. This dichotomy prompts demonstrations of protest when monetary policy conferences or the like are held. Much discord and conflict would be avoided if the two value systems could be integrated.

Economic goals are simple to understand and usually simple to compute—the bottom line says it all. Religious goals, on the other hand, are many, complex and varied. They also fight each other, vying for precedence. If our various religious objectives could be united to present one overarching goal (perhaps under the banner of a universal religion), then its priority versus the priority of an economic goal might be more readily assessed. Clearly no unification of moral and economic goals can be achieved while the current situation prevails.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please keep in mind that my thoughts have been sketched here simply to demonstrate how a value system might be later deduced from the desire to support Life’s continued evolution. Let me be the first to say that the logic I display above is likely weak, and probably non-productively biased by personal constructs. Such deliberations should properly be carried out by experts, wise representatives of a variety of disciplines and communities, not just a single neophyte like myself.

Early theologians spent much time thinking about moral problems and formulating faith-based solutions. These satisfied the needs of the less-rational societies that existed in times past. Computer-driven cultures (that are beginning to dominate the world) crave a more logical moral code.

Developing a rational moral code of behaviour is clearly very difficult, but it is not impossible. Development can begin just as soon as a single supreme universal purpose has been defined and adopted.

I do not expect widespread acceptance of, nor even interest in, the idea that the world is ripe for a different kind of religion. But I do anticipate some level of interest, because discussions of a number of matters related to the theme of this book are common throughout the media today. My hope is that a few individuals, a small but critical mass,&lt;ref&gt;Critical mass does not mean fifty percent or more of the world’s population. It simply means the number of people needed to bring about a significant change. Very few, like-minded, influential individuals may be all that’s required.&lt;/ref&gt; will act or react in a way that benefits civilization.

A few ways they might do so are discussed in the next chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">From meta-purpose, to universal purpose, to a universal religion: what a train of thought!

Our meta-purpose remains just an undefined vision of what Life might eventually become. “Supporting Life’s journey to become oB” may well be an emotionally appealing activity worth adopting when considering behavioural alternatives. However, it will not serve as the guiding purpose the world needs to craft legislation of use in international courts of law. For that a well-defined “universal purpose” is needed.

A universal purpose is also required if a nation-guiding moral code is to be developed. Such a code would provide the moral authority international bodies need if they are to serve humanity well as we move into a very uncertain future.

This chapter suggests steps that might be taken to build a universal religion from the yet-to-be-developed universal purpose. Some might consider that a powerfully worded and valued purpose should suffice to guide collective global decision making, but this is not how the mind operates. As we saw in [[../Revelations And Conversions/Constructs|Constructs]], the mental Construct that a belief develops can preclude alternative ways of thinking, thus all true believers of any doctrine will always claim that the commandments of their faith override any national or international law. Something labelled a “universal religion” may come to be regarded as worthy of being equally obeyed. The hope is that some day members of all religions might take the time to consider what was being said, if it were being expressed by a sufficient number of  well-respected and influential people all claiming to follow a “universal religion.”

Again, the “universal religion” being proposed here is not something to be force fed to anyone. It should be seen as a companion to other religions, concerned about and dealing with the welfare of community and life, but having nothing to say about any individual after-life beliefs. Eventually, however, the rationality of the proposed universal religion will lead it to replace the less objective religions that we have inherited, because humankind is itself becoming more rational. Perhaps this transition will occur sometime in the future, however, not in this century, most likely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to help solve problems of the kind noted earlier, our new religion must possess certain features.

The religion has to be suited to our times. Real and relevant issues must be recognized and addressed in a practical manner.

The religion must be rationally based. Modern-day living is founded upon knowledge discovered by rational thinking; to begin irrational speculation when developing a religion would simply not be sensible. In crafting our definition of a universal purpose to guide development of a new religion, the definition must assume as little as possible, be as logical as possible, and be based upon the best of current knowledge.

Our choice of religious purpose must satisfy the same criteria that all religious purposes must fulfill—universality and timelessness. To have ubiquitous appeal it must be universally meaningful and applicable. To survive and guide our way into the future it must be soundly based and have longevity. It must, in effect, apply to and connect not just humanity, but all organisms living at any time and in any galaxy, just as some existing religions intimate their ideologies apply.

Our new religion must embrace and support our emotional needs as well as our rational needs. We are creatures of both worlds, responding to feelings and concepts of spirituality that our body’s emotions generate, as well as to the logic upon which our minds operate and thrive. Our religion’s vision needs aspects of both dimensions—music, art, feelings, emotions, awe and wonder must heighten and colour, and coexist with, rational truth.&lt;ref&gt;A religion built rationally might more effectively be sold emotionally. Humans respond to both to varying degrees. But beware of loss of integrity, and let rationality be present and dominate at every stage of its presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines and teachings of the new religion must be logically derivable from its purpose. If, to guide our moral decision making, a universal purpose is indeed formulated from Life’s “meta-purpose,” then the guidelines we later develop must all emanate from the desire to achieve this purpose. Thus, we cannot, for example, simply proclaim an unfounded “it-is-wrong-to-xxxxx” commandment. An analysis of the links between the consequences of any particular action and the religion’s overall purpose must clearly and logically show why each behaviour is deemed “wrong” or “right.” We are developing an abstract environment which increasingly rational minds in the future will explore to its limits; if not rationally built, then this environment will collapse.

Our new religion cannot be developed by only one individual—there is too much to construct and too much at stake. Its development must be crafted by many, particularly those who possess relevant knowledge: theologians and scientists, managers and workers, people who practice many disciplines, those who tread many lands, and members of many cultures. It must begin as it must continue, involving all who want to contribute to the future welfare of the supersystem Life that supports us.

The religion’s development cannot end. Being knowledge-based and rationally structured, its tenets must continuously be amended as our knowledge base enlarges. Only our assumed meta-purpose, if properly composed, should resist the need for change. It should be a statement that lasts forever.

Ways must be found to separate religious power from legislated power, and legislated power must take precedence. The mental constructs that religions build may overrule logic in the minds of some and create fanatics; it must be made impossible for such individuals to seize control. (And legislated power should be refereed by the electorate, for it is individuals who contribute to Life’s continuation and evolution, not the state.) When disputes arise, such as the economic vs. moral dilemma that patent laws create, the populace must decide how they wish to proceed if democracy is to be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Democracy forms one corner of civilization’s foundation. In a democracy, the direction in which civilization heads is a matter for the population to decide. It also determines the apex, the purpose to be used when writing society’s governing laws. The population, in democracies, has always placed religion in this position.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new religion, for reasons that apply to all institutions, must incorporate defences against being exploited. Open debate and welcomed questioning, transparency, frequent internal and external audits, auditors that change every few years, leaders that are regularly replaced, and precautionary measures of many other kinds must be developed and maintained. The power commanded by a position within the hierarchy serving the needs of a universal religion will always attract some who would position personal gain over Life’s gain.

The envisaged universal religion would not replace or usurp existing religions. It is proposed as an umbrella doctrine, developed to cover gaps that existing faiths may leave open. (The religion most closely resembles a universal “Hippocratic Oath.” This oath does not prevent any one in the medical profession from being Christian, Muslim, Hindu or otherwise. It says nothing about the afterlife and little about God, but it does say much of what needs to be said about how to conduct oneself in an ethical manner.)

A universal religion would not unite the world to form one nation, just as other religions do not unite individuals to form one entity. There is as great a need for singularity among nations as there is for individuality among individuals. Life’s advancement is fostered by diversity; uniformity merely sustains life in between advances. (For this reason, any universal religion must accept the existence of other “universal religions.” But that is another story—there are no others at the moment, and the future will take care of that need, when the time arises!)

Doubtlessly our new religion could have many other characteristics, but the above list should suffice for our purposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some individuals are likely more ready than others to help found a new religion. Possibly those who have already drifted away from their god, but feel the loss. Or, perhaps, those who may think that a God exists or existed, but one that intends Life to fend for itself. Or people who think that no such Being exists, yet are distressed by life’s apparent meaninglessness. Or even those who think that their religion lacks the criteria they need to make some of today’s moral choices and seek something supplemental or an alternative. This section suggests how such individuals might work together to fill some of these gaps.

Again, please keep in mind that I am not trying to overthrow any existing religion. This discussion that follows is simply to explore whether people of the world see any need for the kind of religion this book is proposing. One day, perhaps in the not-too-distant future, some kind of rational religion might become appealing, but I suspect that the time may not yet be ripe. Fertilizing humanity’s mental soil in the hope that something might eventually grow is all that might occur if some of what follows were to be attempted. This alone, I think, is worth the effort.

Before continuing, let’s recall why I think a new religion may one day be needed. Significant problems periodically threaten world affairs, and current institutions seem inadequate to address them. Some likely solutions will eventually require expropriating national autonomy, subordinating it to world-wide authority, but there is currently no substantial authority of this kind. A massive blow, such as that dealt to the United States by the terrorist actions on September 11th, 2001, is needed before nations feel they have the moral authority to unite to counter further threats. This feeling soon evaporates, however, for only the recipients of the blow carry the loss constantly in their minds. And, as [[../../Possible Applications/]] noted, many other threats, current and potential, practical but often moral, need some degree of global consensus to be effectively countered. An international court might be given the legal authority to enforce international laws, but there are likely to be many situations (population control, embryonic stem cell use, or euthanasia, perhaps) where some degree of additional moral authority would be needed. If developed, a universal religion of the kind discussed in this book might make such moral authority permanently available, thus legitimizing the early examination of such problems and perhaps preventing them from becoming pandemic.

Keep in mind that, while the premise of this universal religion is simple, the process of developing it is certainly not. Indeed, the endeavour will be fraught with challenges, distractions and setbacks (not the least of which will come from those who oppose such a new tenet).&lt;ref&gt;Opposition is likely to come mostly from those in the middle—organizational and institutional heads and managers who fear disruption of their niches. Leaders of many religious organizations are extremely likely to oppose the development of an alternative universal purpose. Heads of non-religious organizations and academia are less likely to oppose such an endeavour, because people in these positions must already realize that one globalized or universal religion is likely to create a more orderly world. This end is particularly desirable, from their point of view, because the value they have built during their time in the organization is best passed on in an orderly world. (Since Life advances through the efforts of those who exploit, this last benefit should not be decried.)&lt;/ref&gt; Every stage of its development will therefore require tremendous dedication, perseverance, patience and altruism.

The remainder of this section assumes, based upon the reasoning given in earlier chapters, that acting to “support Life’s continued evolution toward becoming a god-like entity or oB” is the most appropriate meta-purpose for rational people to adopt and transform into a universal purpose. Given this, perhaps something like the following “hierarchy of action” might feasibly lead to the eventually realization of a universal religion.

''Individuals'': May have read this book or may already be thinking along similar lines. Want to correct problems that impact upon our future, and will probably already be in contact and working with others of like mind. May already be working in organizations to achieve related ends.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the WFA (the World Federalist Association)  “promotes the universal rule of law at the international level,” and is just one of many activist-organizing associations. (See http://www.wfa.org.)&lt;/ref&gt; Probably know other individuals active in parallel endeavours who will unite in support if one common purpose can be found. Already using websites and the internet to share ideas and to influence others.

Realize that the magnitude and number of significant world problems necessitates a proportionally large and long-term effort towards change. May be discussing the need to unite with other groups and individuals. May be drafting meta- or universal purpose statements and seeking consensus using Delphi survey methods&lt;ref&gt;Such survey methods involve summarizing the results of a survey or poll and returning this summary to the respondents, who are asked to read it then respond to another survey. Repetition can clarify ideas, and may develop consensus.&lt;/ref&gt; or equivalents. May act as website masters, developing, linking and maintaining relevant sites, chat groups, bulletin boards, etc.

''Working groups'': Would want to educate one another. Would need to formulate sub-purposes to guide joint efforts. Would want to unite like-minded regional, national and international groups and efforts. Would need the support of people with vision, passion and ideas, as well as energy, money and influence. Would seek the co-operation of any and all organizations, particularly religions and those currently involved in formulating or promoting universally applicable moral standards or ethical principles.

Would constantly strive to educate the public and new members. Would finalize the definition of the universal purpose and draft statements of moral codes and ethical principles derived from this purpose. Would refine these statements as groups in different nations (particularly those of different cultures and faiths) seek to meld.

Would utilize the best analytic and strategic techniques. Would outline desired scenarios for years ahead as guides to develop strategies, plans and tactics; such descriptions would also convey to all a vision of the kind of future being anticipated, so inviting discussion, feedback and revision. (See [[../../Multi-year Targets/]],” a postscript to this chapter, for speculations about possible long-term goals.) Would attempt to foresee possible setbacks and develop contingency plans, etc. Would provide intelligent guidance to the whole movement, yet remain particularly close to the grassroots level by ensuring a steady exchange of personnel, and by limiting how long any one person may serve in any role.

''Action groups'': Would use their influence to educate the populace, and formulate approaches that would gain the support of organizations and governments in all of the world’s nations. Would find ways to respect and work within existing laws; would reject and help to prosecute those who harm others or damage property under the guise of participating in the larger cause. Would counter establishments’ efforts to derail this work using the meta-purpose-conjured vision to obtain popular support. Would enlist the support of like-minded organizations, and exploit the media’s need for news to gain national and international exposure, understanding, credibility, respect and active support. Would attempt to work with organizations that oppose the universal purpose’s ideals, to minimize harm done by such organizations. Would eventually have enough support to influence multinational organizations of every kind.

''World directorate'': Would be structured to be accountable to the world’s population, by ensuring free and unrestricted media access, and by setting up and maintaining all manner of web and internet interactions, including mechanisms that facilitate active debate of the pros and cons of the universal religion’s various statements and activities. Would have secure referendum and web-voting facilities to involve the world populace. Must have many built-in safeguards and a variety of audit mechanisms to prevent subversion by those desiring to exploit the world using this kind of organization.

Would eventually direct mechanisms able to ensure the compliance of individuals, organizations and nations, in the one area of their mandate—that is, to ensure the continued development of life (or as otherwise more comprehensively and precisely defined). Would have no power to restrict non-related human activities, such as benign global commerce or freedom of religious expression. May resemble the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;There is currently no organization constituted or able to perform the functions we are discussing; something entirely new needs to be developed.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This endeavour is not intended to produce a totalitarian world. It is not intended to usurp any nation’s authority or power to govern as that nation sees fit, except in its one, world-mandated, area of responsibility. It is not intended to replace or deny any religion, nor is it intended to remove any individual’s right to freedom of thought, word or deed. 

But it is intended to curb these behaviours whenever the activities of one or some threaten to jeopardize the future of life on this planet (and, later, wherever else life is found). Managing life’s exploitive nature necessitates also developing the means to control its destructive excesses when they occur. Most nations have already developed ways to lawfully control individuals and organizations within their boundaries; we must develop lawful ways to do the same at an international level. A carefully designed universal religion would provide the rationale, moral authority and foundation for such laws to exist.

Above all, the universal religion should construct and maintain the environment that contains a new code of behaviour, a new morality, a new wisdom; one which will guide our decision making as we explore the many marvellous medical, technological, cosmological and other pathways opening up before us—routes to a life that the developers of our traditional religions never dreamed could exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Our new universal religion, should one come to be, must be founded upon, and headed by, a purpose whose truth, simplicity, utility and appeal are unmistakable. It must be easy to understand, clear in intent, and suited to guide us all, collectively, to a better way of living. Should peace between nations be our sole desire, then our selection of purpose is much less critical—any that brings unification will serve. However, if we seek more, if we value a long and healthy future for our descendants and for Life, for centuries and millennia to come, then our selection of purpose becomes extremely critical. We must choose one consistent with and respectful of the reality thrust upon us by this universe, simply because we must formulate a guide to living in this universe, not to living in an afterlife. Thus, the behavioural creeds we author must be rationally constructed with this reality in mind. Our new religion must be founded upon what we know—rather than what we invent—about ourselves, our cosmos, our origins, and our future possibilities.

Only the meta-purpose we adopt must be an assumption, for the universe itself cannot be shown to be directed toward a purpose, and this actuality thus applies to all within. Once this single assumption is accepted, then only truth and logic must be used to deduce the behaviour required to attain our chosen endpoint—thus constructing exemplary commandments. Circumstances may be forcing us to repeat doctrinal steps originally taken many hundreds of years ago, however today we have a better grasp of reality, and can use confirmed facts in many places where our forefathers could only conjecture.

To become an influential factor in controlling exploitive excesses, our universal religion must become an incontrovertible part of everyone’s mind—perhaps, eventually, the mind’s most cherished Construct. A constant awareness that no act should harm Life’s continued evolution may be all that is needed. It may be enough for every child and adult to know that this responsibility is everyone’s responsibility, and that it preempts all other purposes and duties.&lt;ref&gt;Eventually we may draft an international code of ethics, and its acceptance and subsequent honouring may become an important rite of passage, perhaps marking the transition from infancy to adulthood (or, even, from nationhood to inter-nationhood). Such a code is likely to be similar to those that many professional organizations develop to guide members’ decision-making—the Hippocratic Oath, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(This proposal would be similar to undertakings of the 8th and 9th centuries, when the Hadith was written to guide the behaviour of the many non-Arab converts to Islam. Coming from differing cultures, many did not know the accepted Arabic norms of behaviour, and needed some guidelines when the Koran was not sufficiently explicit.)&lt;/ref&gt; Individual lives may come and go, but our hard-gained wisdom must continue. Our lives, and those of our ancestors, lose all meaning if our accumulated knowledge and understanding is not benefited from, built upon, and bequeathed forward.

The world is in labour to produce a second renaissance. Like the first, this reconstruction results from a growth in knowledge and understanding about the real nature of life, the universe and ourselves. Unlike the first, this renaissance will grow very quickly, spread and fed by electronic media, sought and bought by the needs of a globalizing world. Unification of ideas, ideals, desires and, eventually, morality will inevitably force the development of a global religion of some kind.

Which course will humanity choose? Will we continue to view morality as an ordained given? Will we refuse to unify and continue to support a million or so different faiths, defend the need to have a multifaceted view of morality, carry on squabbling and never reach a collective agreement when international situations demand one? Or will we succumb to some new visionary who is revitalizing one of the old god-headed myths, and unite to create the needed global religion in this manner? Or will we choose to develop one that can be forward-looking and reality-based?
 
All we need to set out on this journey is a single meta-purpose to act as a beacon. Used to frame a universal purpose and an associated set of behaviours, we would have laid the foundation of a religion that would be rational and practical, moral and just, timeless and universal. Our descendants would then have the right to speak with confidence, proud of their beliefs and actions, certain about the behaviours they practiced, ready, willing and able to join, with heads held high, all the other great civilizations of the universe.

None of this will come to pass in the next few generations. But equally, none seems impossible to bring about, given the will and enduring effort of many who care.

Ah! If only we might return after death, to see what has come to pass. To see heaven on Earth—what an afterlife for us to witness, and what a legacy for us to bequeath!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Embedded Technology is now in its prime and the wealth of knowledge available is mindblowing. There are many ''open source'' designs available for study and use by anyone from a hobbyist to an engineer.

Before moving into a detailed discussion on embedded systems, it is best to understand the essence of an embedded system. What can we call an embedded system and how is it different from a computer? There are many answers, each coming from experts treating these systems from different point of views. But, almost all definitions agree on a few basic characteristics of an embedded system:

* ''It is a system built to perform its duty, completely or partially independent of human intervention.''
* ''It is specially designed to perform a few tasks in the most efficient way.''
* ''It interacts with physical elements in our environment, viz. controlling and driving a motor, sensing temperature, etc.''

One of the most important distinguishing factor between an embedded system and a computer is the constraints on system resources. Unlike modern day computers, an embedded system is usually designed to be compact, energy efficient, and inexpensive. Another factor is that a computer is capable of performing a variety of tasks completely independent of each other. Though many advanced embedded systems exhibit multi-tasking capabilities, it is unreasonable to expect a system operating on washing machines to provide capability to play digital music. 

From an implementation viewpoint, there is a major difference between a computer and an embedded system. Embedded systems are often required to provide '''''Real-Time response'''''. A '''''Real-Time system''''' is defined as a system whose correctness depends on the timeliness of its response. Examples of such systems are flight control systems of an aircraft, sensor systems in nuclear reactors and power plants. For these systems, delay in response is a fatal error. A more relaxed version of '''''Real-Time Systems''''', is the one where timely response with small delays is acceptable. An example of such a system would be the Scheduling Display System on the railway platforms. In technical terminology, '''''Real-Time Systems''''' can be classified as:

* '''''Hard Real-Time Systems''''' - systems with severe constraints on the timeliness of the response.
* '''''Soft Real-Time Systems''''' - systems which tolerate small variations in response times.
* '''''Hybrid Real-Time Systems''''' - systems which exhibit both hard and soft constraints on its performance.

As we go into more detail about these systems, we will learn that Real-Time constraints pose a very difficult implementation problem. Complex problems like scheduling and resource management do tend to appear like ten headed fire breathing dragons to most newcomers in this field.

In the next section, we will systematically list down the important characteristics of the different classes of embedded systems. We will also discuss another class of embedded systems, Distributed Embedded Systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vectors and scalars are mathematical constructs which physicists employ. Some physical quantities are represented by scalars and some by vectors and corresponding operations are employed upon them while dealing with them. Vector quantities have a direction associated with them while scalars are treated like simple numbers. 
__TOC__

The following are some examples of quantities that are represented as scalars and vectors.
==Scalars==

The following quantities have a magnitude but no direction associated with them, and are examples of scalars:

* distance
* speed
* time
* mass
* energy
* density
* temperature

Normally scalar quantities follow the basic algebraic rules for any mathematical manipulation such as addition, subraction, multiplication or division (as we do with numbers).
===Addition of scalars===

Adding scalars is simple, all you need to do is to add the numbers together. For example, 5m + 3m = 8m, or 76b + 23b = 99b

===Multiplication and division of scalars===

Multiplying and dividing scalars is the same as multiplying and dividing normal numbers.

You should also remember to multiply and divide the units, so that you can check your answers are given in the correct units. For example, if you were finding the area of a surface: &lt;math&gt;3m \times 3m = 9m^2&lt;/math&gt;. The unit of area is &lt;math&gt;m^2&lt;/math&gt;, so this is correct.

==Vectors==

The concept of direction establishes a relationship between two points in space; that is, the &quot;direction&quot; from one point to another. For example, the direction from point A to point B could be designated A-to-B while the opposite direction would be in that case B-to-A. Direction is dimensionless; that is, it has no measurement units and represents only a line designating the sense of from-to (from A to B) with no sense of &quot;how much&quot; which is considered the &quot;magnitude&quot; of a measurable quantity.

&quot;Magnitude&quot; provides a sense of &quot;how much&quot; (or &quot;how many&quot;) of a measurable quantity. The term five miles has a magnitude of five units of measure; this unit of measure is miles.

When magnitude (&quot;five&quot; miles) is coupled with direction (let's say north; which is the dimensionless direction from me to the North Star) we obtain &quot;five miles north&quot;; this is a &quot;vector&quot;. A &quot;vector&quot; has both magnitude and direction. A special type of vector has a magnitude of one in a given direction and is called a “unit vector” for that direction. A quantity that has only magnitude but has no associated direction is a &quot;scalar&quot;, as described earlier.

Two vectors that have the same direction and magnitude are equal; a vector from me that is &quot;five miles north&quot; is equal to a vector from you that is &quot;five miles north&quot;; wherever you are. However, the position obtained by moving from me to &quot;five miles north&quot; of me is not a vector. The vector is the &quot;displacement&quot; that consists of a magnitude of distance (five miles) and a direction (north). A position can be represented by a beginning reference point (you; wherever you are) and a vector (five miles north), but a vector alone is not a location; it must have a reference location to be meaningful as a position.

The following quantities have both a magnitude and a direction associated with them, and therefore are vectors:

* Displacement (e.g., five miles north)
* Velocity (50 metres per second, bearing 60 degrees 15 seconds)
* Acceleration (32 feet per second per second straight up)
* Weight (your weight straight down)
* Force (the amount of energy in a given direction) 

Vectors can be represented in any set of spatial dimensions, though typically they are expressed in 2-D or 3-D space.

===Multiplication===
&lt;u&gt;Multiplying Vectors to Scalars&lt;/u&gt;
 
When you multiply a vector by a scalar, the result is a vector. Its direction is unchanged if multiplied by a positive scalar and its direction is reversed when multiplied by a negative scalar. The vector's magnitude is simply multiplied by the scalar. &lt;!-- todo: simple diagram, maybe?--&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Multiplying Vectors to Vectors&lt;/u&gt;

There are two different kinds of multiplication when you multiply two vectors together. There is the dot product, and there is the cross product. The multiplication of two vectors is outside of the scope of an A-level physics course, but you can find out about them on Wikipedia.

===Addition of vectors===

Vectors can be added like scalars as long as they are facing exactly the same direction. If the vectors are in opposite directions, you must subtract one from the other, and unless stated otherwise, you should use the common conventions that:

* up is positive, and down is negative, and
* right is positive and left is negative.

When the vectors aren't in a straight line, you must use another method to find their sum.

====Pythagoras' theorem====

[[Image:Pythagoras vector combination.png|200px|left]]
If the two vectors are perpendicular to each other, it is possible to find the total vector using Pythagoras' theorem, with the resultant vector being the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle.


The direction of the resultant can be found using the formula: &lt;math&gt;\tan \phi = \frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is one of the sides touching (adjacent to) the angle, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the side opposite the angle, and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the resultant vector.

Notice that vector ''a'' has no effect in the direction of vector ''b'', and similarly, vector ''b'' has no effect in the direction of vector ''a''. When two vectors are perpendicular to each other, it is said that they act independently of each other.

===Resolving vectors into two perpendicular components===

[[Image:Resolve_vector_to_components.png|200px|right]] &lt;!--image must stay on right otherwise bullet points do not work--&gt;

A vector can be broken down into '''components''', which are perpendicular to each other, so that the vector sum of these two components, is equal to the original vector. (Usually, it is interesting to break down a vector into two perpendicular components, such that one is vertical and the other horizontal.  However, the components do not have to be chosen to be vertical and horizontal always; they only need to be perpendicular to each other). Splitting a vector into two components is called '''resolving''' the vector. It is the reverse of using Pythagoras' theorem to add two perpendicular vectors, and so adding the two components will give you the original vector. There are many uses for vectors that have been split in this way.

Resolving a vector requires some simple trigonometry. In the diagram, the vector to be resolved is the force, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. For angle &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;:
*the horizontal component of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;F_x = F\ \cos\ A&lt;/math&gt;, and
*the vertical component of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;F_y = F\ \sin\ A&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the two components do not have to be horizontal and vertical. The angle &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; can be changed to any required direction, and both components will still be perpendicular to each other.

Why should the average Norwegian-learner already know phonetics? They don't do IPA and phonetics in kiddie school in the USA for one. Adding sound recordings to illustrate the sounds would also be wise, as SAMPA is even less known than IPA. --[[User:Kaleissin|Kaleissin]] 16:51, 24 August 2005 (UTC)


There should be a more detailed section about the different accents. I tried to learn the numbers with 3 Norwegians and each one of them spoke differently (very differently). And I still can't do the Rolling Rr's [[User:158.36.150.170|158.36.150.170]] 21:55, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

The pronunciation of &quot;v&quot; is stated to be identical in English and Norwegian here, but in fact they are different.</text>

==Fact Checking and Citation==
I went hunting for help on this and came up with:
* [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check]]
* [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check]]
* [[WikiPedia:Cite_sources]]

Here is what I think are the guiding principals
* Every fact in this book needs to be checked.
* We need to know which facts have been checked.
* The best way to flag facts as checked is to provide the citation.
** The citation is credible evidence that the fact was actually checked.

Based on the work they are starting on at Wikipedia, I have come to the
following conclusions about a practical approach
* Create a reference with the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{an}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template {{an|noteA}}
* Create a &lt;nowiki&gt;==References==&lt;/nowiki&gt; section to contain the references
** Use the &lt;nowiki&gt;#{{Anb}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to create the reference
* Refer to the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check|Wikipedia Fact and Reference Check WikiProject]] for links to examples.  Especially their FAC of the week.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Functions are named blocks of program code that perform a specific task and return a result. The task can be as simple as adding two numbers or as complex as launching a spacecraft. A subroutine is like a function, just that it does not return a result.

==Defining procedures==
An example function definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Function Sum(ByRef Number1 As Double, ByRef Number2 As Double) As Double
    'Return the result by writing it to a variable having the same name as the function
    Sum = Number1 + Number2
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

An example subroutine definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Sub Tell(ByVal MyString1 as String, ByVal MyString2 as String)
    MsgBox MyString1 &amp; MyString2
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the following:
* The arguments to the function are declared as [[../Glossary#Byref|ByRef]] which requires the compiler to make sure that only arguments of the specified type are used, in this case Double.
* The function returns a value by assigning it to the function name as though the function were a variable. This contrasts with the use of the keyword ''return'' in many other languages.

==Calling procedures==

You can use or call the two procedures defined in the previous sections as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  'On the next line, argument order matters
  Tell &quot;Hello there.&quot;, &quot;&quot;
  'On the next line, names of arguments are used and argument order does not matter.  
  Tell MyString1:=&quot;Hello there,&quot;, MyString2:=&quot; again.&quot;
  'Tell (&quot;Hello there.&quot;,&quot;&quot;) -- syntax error

  MySum = Sum(123.456, 234)
  MySum2 = Sum(Number2:=8, Number1:=6)
  'MySum3 = Sum Number2:=8, Number1:=6 -- syntax error
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the following:
* The arguments (''argument list'') passed to a ''function'' must be enclosed in round brackets, whereas those supplied to a subroutine need not.

==Procedure parts==
Each function and subroutine has the following parts, some of the optional:
; Visibility : ''Public'', ''Friend'' or ''Private''
; Procedure Type : ''Sub'', ''Function'', ''Property Let'', ''Property Get'', ''Property Set''
; Name : A freely chosen name that starts with a letter and contains only letters, numbers and underscores.
; Argument List : A list of the items of data that the procedure reads or writes into.
; Return Type : For a ''Function'' or ''Property Get'', the data type returned, such as ''Double'' or ''String''.
; Body : All the statements that do the work.

Only the ''Name'' and the ''Procedure Type'' are mandatory. Of course, a procedure without a body doesn't do anything.

==Visibility==
This seems like a very unimportant part of a procedure declaration to
most people but in fact it is a very helpful feature.  With it you can
show that some procedures are just for use inside a module
(''Private''), some only for use in this component (''Friend'') or
available for the whole world (''Public'').  You should mark
procedures ''Private'' unless they will be called from outside the
''module''.  this will encourage you, and anyone who edits your
program, to place related procedures in the same module which
obviously makes maintenance easier.

Marking a procedure ''Private'' also means that you can have another
procedure with exactly the same name in another module.
== Early Termination ==
Use '''Exit Function''' or '''Exit Sub''' to terminate a procedure in the middle, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Sub LengthyComputation(fat, n)
    If n = 0 Or n = 1 Then
      fat = 1
      ' Now terminate
      Exit Sub
    End If
    ' Now compute fat ...
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

==Procedure type==
All procedures are either functions that return a result as the value of the function, or subroutines that are called for their side effects. To return a value, you can use both, but with subroutine, you need to do it via an argument:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Private Function FunctionHalf(ByRef y as Double) as Double
    FunctionHalf = y / 2
  End Function

  Private Sub SubroutineHalf(ByRef y As Double, ByRef Result As Double)
    Result = y / 2
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

The two procedures do essentially the same thing, that is, divide a number by two.  The ''Function'' version does it by ''assigning'' the new value to the name of the function while the ''Sub'' version assigns it to the name of one of the ''arguments''. This affects how you use them.

The function version can be used in an expression as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Debug.Print FunctionHalf(10) 'Prints 5&lt;/source&gt;

To use the subroutine to return value, you need to store the value in a variable, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Dim nHalf as Double
  SubroutineHalf 10, nHalf
  Debug.Print nHalf
&lt;/source&gt;

Generally, you use a ''Function'' when the result is a single thing (number, string, object) and a ''Sub'' when you either want to return several distinct things or nothing at all.

''Properties'' are also a form of procedure. ''Property Get'' is a function; ''Property Let'' and ''Property Set'' are subroutines. For more discussion of ''Properties'', see the [[../Object Oriented Programming/]] chapter.

==Optional arguments==
You can specify optional arguments and default values:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Function MySum(i1, i2, Optional i3)
  If IsMissing(i3) Then
    MySum = i1 + i2
  Else
    MySum = i1 + i2 + i3
  End If
End Function

Function MyConcatenate(String1, String2, Optional Separator = &quot; &quot;)
  'Default value for Separator specified
  MyConcatenate = String1 &amp; Separator &amp; String2
End Function

Sub Test()
  Debug.Print MySum(1, 2) * MySum(1, 2, 3)
  Debug.Print MyConcatenate(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;)
  Debug.Print MyConcatenate(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;, &quot;, &quot;)
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

Once an argument is declared optional, all arguments at the right of it have to be declared optional as well.

__NOTOC__
'''Salmon Grilled on a Cedar Plank''' is a common method for preparing salmon, traditional to the Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest of the United States and British Columbia in Canada.

The cedar planks should be free of any chemical treatments or coatings. The planks are soaked in water for several hours prior to grilling, to prevent burning. A baking pan of water with the planks weighted down to submerge them works well.

The salmon should be prepared to fit on the planks of cedar.  Whole fillets can be placed on longer planks, while shorter ones can be used for salmon steaks.  Salmon should be as fresh as possible.  Wild salmon has the most flavor, but farm raised salmon is also acceptable, and less expensive.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Salmon|Salmon]]  1/3 to 1/2 lb (150-225g) per person  (I like left overs)
*Marinade
**[[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]] - a half cup
**A little [[Cookbook:Garlic Powder|garlic powder]] 
**[[Cookbook:Lemon Pepper|Lemon pepper]]
**A [[Cookbook:Beer|beer]]

==Equipment==
*Cedar planks
*A BBQ pit.  Charcoal should be spread somewhat to the back so the fish can be moved for more or less fire.

==Procedure==
#Preheat the grill
#Briefly place the salmon in the marinade
#Place the salmon on the plank skin side down. It should not hang over. 
#Grill watching carefully. A glass of water or the left over marinade by the grill can be used to partially douse the fire when it gets too hot. As an alternative, a squirt-bottle or mister filled with water can douse any fire that commences on the plank.  Individual planks give flexibility in moving to get all done evenly. Don't turn the fish on the plank, just move the plank(s) around, rotate, etc. 
#Remove the plank to onto a baking pan when the fish is cooked to the desired &quot;doneness&quot; and transfer to plates or a serving platter.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*A [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]] can be used to cook the salmon to greater degrees of &quot;doneness&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many times, we use the terms vibration and oscillation without knowing the difference between them. The term oscillation refers strictly to the repeating motion of a point mass or that of a rigid body while the term vibration refers to the repeating motion or deformations of an elastic structure. Thus any oscillation is a term used only in cases like the motion of a pendulum or that of a ship as a rigid body moving on the wavy seas while vibration is a term used for phenomenon exhibited by structures such as rotating fans or motors etc. Vibration involves deformation by definition while an oscillating structure does not deform.

In Structural and Mechanical engineering context, oscillation and vibration are differentiated based on the &quot;restoring force&quot; present in the system. For both oscillation and vibration, the mass of a system at rest (static equilibrium) need to be disturbed from its rest or equilibrium position. The mass gets excited and initiate oscillation or vibration; but only with the presence of a restoring force. If the disturbance is from an unstable or neutral equilibrium, possibility of any restoring force is lacking and the mass eventually moves away and occupies a new position. In the case of (i) stable equilibrium of a mass or (ii) mass being attached to a spring (or an elastic member), a restoring force comes into being and the mass is tended back to the original equilibrium position and as a result, periodic motion starts.

In case (i), generally, component of gravity (g) operated upon the associated mass component serves as restoring force. Thus the system undergoes no &quot;elongations or strains&quot; than rigid body motion, as in the case of a simple pendulum. Such &quot;no-strain&quot; periodic motions are referred to as oscillation.

In case (ii), spring force developed on the attached spring or elastic member serves as the restoring force. Thus the attached member undergoes &quot;periodic elongation or strain&quot;. Thus the mass as well as attached member undergoes periodic motion. Such &quot;strained&quot; periodic motions are referred to as vibrations.

In the expression for natural frequency,ω, 'g' is a parameter in the case of oscillations and 'k' in the case of vibrations.     
For the oscillation of simple pendulum, ω = sqrt(g/l), where as for the vibration of spring-mass system, ω = sqrt(k/m); with usual notations.



==Dynamic Load ==
We have studied how we find the response of a structure to static load. When we come to study vibrations, what we have is not static load but dynamic load. The very nature of the load means that the response of the structure i.e the displacement, stress, reactions etc. also varies with time (see, also, [[Seismic fitness]]). 

What is Dynamic load ?
Dynamic load is the load which varies. The variation may be with respect to time (Ex : reciprocating engine) or with respect to space (Ex : Moving vehicle on bridge).
The next question arises is at what rate it should change ? For example in a Dam the water level changes throughout the year then should we consider it as a dynamic load for designing the dam? NO, because though the load is changing with respect to time its inertial effect is very less for practical consideration.

To make it more clear, a Dynamic load (externally applied) is not only a function of time, say F(t), but also one which excites the mass of the system causing inertial effect. The physicist who deals with the problem has to decide whether the force, F(t) is a dynamic one or not based on the significance of the excitation.

It is also interesting to note that a dynamic load is not essential to produce vibration or oscillation. An initial displacement or velocity will trigger free vibration in an appropriate system (Ex : a spring-mass system like shock absorber of automobile)

==Forces Involved==
In any vibrating system, there are a total of four types of forces that need to be taken into account. These are listed here.
*Inertial Force
*Spring Force
*Damping Force
*Total External Force

The inertial force occurs because acceleration is present. We know if a body having mass 'm' is moving with an acceleration 'a' then the force acting on it is the inertial force given by : 

&lt;math&gt;f(accl)=m*a&lt;/math&gt; 

The Spring force arises due to the elasticity of the material. It is proportional to the displacement. But actually it may vary linearly, quadratically or other proportionality law but for simplicity in modelling we assume that this force varies linearly. This assumption holds good for most of the general cases and hence accepted. If the extension in the spring is 'x' then the spring force is given by : 

&lt;math&gt;f(spr)=k*x&lt;/math&gt;

where 'k' is the proportionality constant known as stiffness of the member.

While these forces are enough to set up harmonic vibrations in a system, most systems also have intrinsic damping even if an external damper is not used. The damping force tends to oppose motion and acts against the velocity in most cases (the exception is negative damping). It generally varies with some power of the velocity though the most useful is viscous damping which varies linearly with velocity. 
If 'v' is the velocity then the viscous damping force is :

&lt;math&gt;f(damp)=m*v&lt;/math&gt;

The total External force 'f(ext)' is the remaining force that acts on the system. It is the force that causes the excitation in the first place and may or may not be present while the system vibrates.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]]

'''Iced Tea''' is a sweetened beverage made from tea and organic acids, and sometimes with flavouring adjuncts.  It is popular in hot climates, usually served over ice.  Fruit juices such as red or white cranberry, grape, orange, grapefruit and passionfruit can be added in amounts ranging from 10% to 25%.

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:tea|tea]] bags 
*1 teaspoon [[w:Stevia|Stevia]] (pure - not cut with fillers)
*2 teaspoons citric acid crystals (or malic / tartaric / citric blends)
*4 teaspoons sugar

==Procedure==
The easiest way to make this is with a drip coffee maker.   Fill the machine with cold water and place the tea bags in the basket.  Place the Stevia, acid and sugar in the pot and place the pot in the machine.  Let it run through its cycle.  Chill the product.  This is a nectar and will make several litres of iced tea.

==To serve==
Place some ice in a tall glass and fill 80%-90% with cold water.  Pour in some iced tea nectar.  You may reduce the water and add some fruit juice if desired.

Note that this product contains virtually no sugar.  While 4 teaspoons are used in the nectar, this is diluted so much that the amount of sugar in a glass is probably less than 1/4 teaspoon.  On a hot day, it is particularly refreshing.  While Stevia is fairly expensive, it goes a long way.  Use only pure Stevia.

==Variations==
*Lemon or lime juice can be used instead of the acid crystals.  This will make a cloudier finished product.  Use about 4 ounces.  
*Garnish with cherries, pineapple, lemon, or lime slices.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structure ==

Electromagnetic (EM) waves are transverse waves that carry energy. This means the light can be polarised like all other transverse waves. Depending on the amount of energy, the waves create the '''electromagnetic spectrum''', comprising (from longest to shortest wavelengths) radio, microwave, infra-red, visible light, ultraviolet, X-ray, gamma ray. Commonly referred to as EM &quot;Radiation,&quot; these waves have wavelengths ranging from several thousand kilometres (&lt;math&gt;\geq 10^{5}&lt;/math&gt; m) to sub-picometres (&lt;math&gt;\leq 10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt; m). 

The wave is actually made up of two components which are perpendicular to the direction of the wave. EM radiation can be thought of as particles (the photon) or waves, which is commonly referred to as the &quot;wave particle duality&quot;

== The Speed of Light ==
All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed (in a vacuum), and that is the universal constant known as the &quot;speed of light,&quot; most often abbreviated by the lower-case letter &quot;c&quot;.

The speed of light is (exactly):&lt;br&gt;
c = 299 792 458 &lt;math&gt;m/s&lt;/math&gt; or&lt;br&gt;
c = 983 571 056 &lt;math&gt;ft/s&lt;/math&gt;

== Visible Light ==

In the middle of the electromagnetic spectrum is visible light, i.e., the range that the human eye has evolved to observe. The following is a chart of the wavelengths of visible light.

   Colour                  Wavelength (m)
   near ultraviolet          3.0 e -7 
   shortest visible blue     4.0 e -7
   blue                      4.6 e -7
   green                     5.4 e -7
   yellow                    5.9 e -7
   orange                    6.1 e -7
   longest visible red       7.6 e -7
   near infra-red            1.0 e -6
   (Table 9.1, Griffiths)

== Useful Equations ==

To find out the energy of a particular EM wave, or its frequency one can use the several forms of the Einstein Equation.

First, to determine an EM wave frequency, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; from its wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The wavelength multiplied by the frequency is always a constant value: the speed of light, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Hence,

 (1) c = &lt;math&gt;\nu \lambda&lt;/math&gt;, 

so you can find the frequency from the wavelength, or vice versa from simply manipulating this relationship.

Next, to determine the energy from a smallest quantity of EM wave (photon). Here, we must introduce another universal quantity known as &quot;Planck's Constant,&quot; most commonly abbreviated by a lower-case &quot;h.&quot; Planck's constant is

 h = 6.626068 e -34 &lt;math&gt;m^{2} kg / s&lt;/math&gt;.

With this in place we can use the &quot;Planck Equation,&quot; which provides a relationship between the frequency, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; of a photon. The relation is as follows:

 (2) E = h &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, if we only have the wavelength with which to start, we can manipulate equation (1) to get what we need.

 (1) c = &lt;math&gt;\nu \lambda&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
     &lt;math&gt;\nu = c / \lambda&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;br&gt;

 (2) E = h c / &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

{{ExerciseRobox|title=Exercise: Remembering Formulas}}
Cover the right hand side of each formula, and use the information about remembering formulas from the previous page to get the right hand side.

{{Robox/Close}}

==Principal Trig Relationships==

The following identities give relationships between the trigonometric functions.
# &lt;math&gt;\sin x =\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-x\right)\quad \,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\cos x =\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-x\right)\quad \,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan x =\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Pythagoras related===

# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin^2{\theta}+\cos^2{\theta}=1&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan^2{\theta}+1=\sec^2{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;


{{ExampleRobox|title=Worked Example: The cot formula is missing}}
One formula is missing.

By dividing the &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin^2{\theta}+\cos^2{\theta}=1&lt;/math&gt; by 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin^2{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; 

or by 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos^2{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; 

we can get two other formulas.

The missing formula is obtained by dividing through by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin^2{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\frac{\sin^2{\theta}}{\sin^2{\theta}}+\frac{\cos^2{\theta}}{\sin^2{\theta}}=\frac{1}{\sin^2{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

The missing formula is:

: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 1+\cot^2{\theta}=\csc^2{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;


{{Robox/Close}}

===Periodicity===

Four trigonometric functions are &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle2\pi&lt;/math&gt; periodic:

# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin{\theta}=\sin{(\theta+2\pi)}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos{\theta}=\cos{(\theta+2\pi)}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\csc{\theta}=\csc{(\theta+2\pi)}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sec{\theta}=\sec{(\theta+2\pi)}&lt;/math&gt;

Two trigonometric functions are &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\pi&lt;/math&gt; periodic:

# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan{\theta}=\tan{(\theta+\pi)}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cot{\theta}=\cot{(\theta+\pi)}&lt;/math&gt;

===Angle Sums===
Formulas involving sums of angles are as follows:

# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin{(\alpha+\beta)}=\sin{\alpha}\cos{\beta}+\cos{\alpha}\sin{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos{(\alpha+\beta)}=\cos{\alpha}\cos{\beta}-\sin{\alpha}\sin{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin{(\alpha-\beta)}=\sin{\alpha}\cos{\beta}-\cos{\alpha}\sin{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos{(\alpha-\beta)}=\cos{\alpha}\cos{\beta}+\sin{\alpha}\sin{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

===Multiple Angle Formulas===
Substituting &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\beta=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; gives the '''double angle formulae'''

# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin{(2\alpha)}=2\sin({\alpha})\cos({\alpha})&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos{(2\alpha)}=\cos^2{\alpha}-\sin^2{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin^2{\alpha}+\cos^2{\alpha}=1&lt;/math&gt; gives 

# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos{(2\alpha)}=2\cos^2{\alpha}-1&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos{(2\alpha)}=1-2\sin^2{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

These can be obtained by putting &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\beta=2\theta, \alpha=\theta&lt;/math&gt; in the addition formula.
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin{(3\theta)}=3\sin{\theta}-4\sin^3{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos{(3\theta)}=4\cos^3{\theta}-3\cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan{(3\theta)}=\frac{3\tan{\theta}-\tan^3{\theta}}{1-3\tan^2{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

This can also be obtained from the angle sums formula.
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle2\sin{(A)}\cos{(B)}=\sin(A+B)+\sin(A-B)&lt;/math&gt;

== Trigonometric functions of some closely related angles ==
This list may duplicate some of the periodicity formulas above, but all the formulas are given for the sake of completeness.  Angles are expressed in degrees rather than radians.  Similar relations for cot, sec and cosec follow immediately from the definitions of these functions; just replace sin by cosec, cos by sec and tan by cot (and vice versa).

=== sin(x) ===
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(-x) = -\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(90^\circ-x) = \cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(90^\circ+x) = \cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(180^\circ-x) = \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(180^\circ+x) = -\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(270^\circ-x) = -\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(270^\circ+x) = -\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(360^\circ-x) = -\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\sin(360^\circ+x) = \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

=== cos(x) ===
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(-x) = \cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(90^\circ-x) = \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(90^\circ+x) = -\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(180^\circ-x) = -\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(180^\circ+x) = -\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(270^\circ-x) = -\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(270^\circ+x) = \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(360^\circ-x) = \cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\cos(360^\circ+x) = \cos(x)&lt;/math&gt;

=== tan(x) ===
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan(-x) = -\tan(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan(90^\circ-x) = \cot(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan(90^\circ+x) = -\cot(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan(180^\circ-x) = -\tan(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan(180^\circ+x) = \tan(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan(270^\circ-x) = \cot(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan(270^\circ+x) = -\cot(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan(360^\circ-x) = -\tan(x)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan(360^\circ+x) = \tan(x)&lt;/math&gt;

=Bird's Opening=
===1...d5===
From here, one possible reply is to treat the position as a [[Chess/Dutch Defence|Dutch Defence]] reversed. As in the Dutch, white can either fianchetto with 2. g3 (Leningrad Dutch) or go for the Stonewall with 2. e3, soon followed by d4 and c3. 

Another possible motive is to go with a uniquely &quot;Bird&quot; strategy of dark-square control. The plan is to develop the King's knight to f3, to fianchetto the dark-square bishop with b3 and Bb2, and to focus in further pressure on the e5 square, sometimes with Qe1 and Qg3. Depending on the position, the white-squared bishop can go either on e2 or on b5 (with the idea to exchange it for the black knight on c6 and clear the way for the move Nf3-e5). The main problem with the arising positions is where to put the b1 knight. Sometimes c3 or d2 are good squares, but at other times, (especially if black pushes d5, c5, d4), it may be good to play a4 and put the knight on a3, with increased queenside control and flexible options.

A third strategy is simply to play for the break e4. The logical moves are d3, Nd2, and Qe1. Note that the king's bishop will go to e2 if black plays Bg4.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== The Preprocessor ===
The [[w:preprocessor|preprocessor]] is either a separate program invoked by the [[w:compiler|compiler]] or part of the compiler itself. It performs intermediate operations that modify the original source code and internal compiler options before the compiler tries to compile the resulting source code.

The instructions that the preprocessor [[w:parsing|parses]] are called '''directives''' and come in two forms: preprocessor and compiler directives. '''Preprocessor directives''' direct the preprocessor on how it should process the source code, and '''compiler directives''' direct the compiler on how it should modify internal compiler options. Directives are used to make writing source code easier (by making it more portable, for instance) and to make the source code more understandable. They are also the only valid way to make use of facilities (classes, functions, templates, etc.) provided by the C++ Standard Library.

{{NOTE|Check the documentation of your compiler/preprocessor for information on how it implements the preprocessing phase and for any additional features not covered by the standard that may be available. For in depth information on the subject of parsing, you can read &quot;[[Compiler Construction|Compiler Construction]]&quot; (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Compiler_Construction)
}}

All directives start with '#' at the beginning of a line. The standard directives are:
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor/Preprocessor Directives}}
==== Inclusion of Header Files (#include) ====
The '''#include''' directive allows a programmer to include contents of one file inside another file. This is commonly used to separate information needed by more than one part of a program into its own file so that it can be included again and again without having to re-type all the source code into each file.

C++ generally requires you to ''declare'' what will be used before using it. So, files called '''[[w:Header (Information Technology)|headers]]''' usually include declarations of what will be used in order for the compiler to successfully compile source code. This is further explained in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/File Organization|File Organization Section]] of the book. The '''standard library''' (the repository of code that is available with every standards-compliant C++ compiler) and 3rd party libraries make use of headers in order to allow the inclusion of the needed declarations in your source code, allowing you to make use of features or resources that are not part of the language itself.

The first lines in any source file should usually look something like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &quot;other.h&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The above lines cause the contents of the files ''iostream'' and ''other.h'' to be included for use in your program. Usually this is implemented by just inserting into your program the contents of ''iostream'' and ''other.h''. When angle brackets (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) are used in the directive, the preprocessor is instructed to search for the specified file in a compiler-dependent location. When double quotation marks (&lt;tt&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/tt&gt;) are used, the preprocessor is expected to search in some additional, usually user-defined, locations for the header file and to fall back to the standard include paths only if it is not found in those additional locations. Commonly when this form is used, the preprocessor will also search in the same directory as the file containing the &lt;tt&gt;#include&lt;/tt&gt; directive.

The &lt;tt&gt;iostream&lt;/tt&gt; header contains various declarations for input/output (I/O) using an abstraction of I/O mechanisms called '''streams'''. For example there is an output stream object called &lt;tt&gt;std::cout&lt;/tt&gt; (where &quot;cout&quot; is short for &quot;console output&quot;) which is used to output text to the standard output, which usually displays the text on the computer screen.

{{NOTE|When including standard libraries, compilers are allowed to make an exception as to whether a header file by a given name actually exists as a physical file or is simply a logical entity that causes the preprocessor to modify the source code, with the same end result as if the entity existed as a physical file. Check the documentation of your preprocessor/compiler for any vendor-specific implementation of the #include directive and for specific search locations of standard and user-defined headers. This can lead to portability problems and confusion.
}}

A list of standard C++ header files is listed below:

{{:C++ Programming/Standard Headers}}

{{NOTE|Before standardization of the headers, they were presented as separated files, like &lt;iostream.h&gt; and so on. This is probably still a requirement on very old (non-standards-compliant) compilers, but newer compilers will accept both methods. There is also no requirement in the standard that headers should exist in a file form. The old method of referring to standard libraries as separate files is obsolete.}}

==== #pragma ====
The '''pragma''' (pragmatic information) directive is part of the standard, but the meaning of any pragma directive depends on the software implementation of the standard that is used.

Pragma directives are used within the source program.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#pragma token(s)
&lt;/source&gt;

You should check the software implementation of the C++ standard you intend to use for a list of the supported tokens. 

For example, one of the most widely used preprocessor pragma directives, &lt;code&gt;#pragma once&lt;/code&gt;, when placed at the beginning of a header file, indicates that the file where it resides will be skipped if included several times by the preprocessor.

{{NOTE|Another method exists, commonly referred to as '''include guards''', that provides this same functionality but uses other include directives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the GCC documentation, &lt;code&gt;#pragma once&lt;/code&gt; has been described as an obsolete preprocessor directive.}}

==== Macros ====
The C++ preprocessor includes facilities for defining &quot;macros&quot;, which roughly means the ability to replace a use of a named macro with one or more tokens.  This has various uses from defining simple constants (though '''const''' is more often used for this in C++), conditional compilation, code generation and more -- macros are a powerful facility, but if used carelessly can also lead to code that is hard to read and harder to debug!

{{NOTE|
Macros do not depend only on the C++ Standard or your actions. They may exist due to the use of external frameworks, libraries or even due the compiler you are using and the specific OS.  We will not cover that information on this book but you may find more information in the ''Pre-defined C/C++ Compiler Macros'' page at ( http://predef.sourceforge.net/ ) the project maintains a complete list of macros that are compiler and OS agnostic.
}}    

===== #define and #undef =====
The '''#define''' directive is used to define values or macros that are used by the preprocessor to manipulate the program source code before it is compiled:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#define USER_MAX (1000)
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''#undef''' directive deletes a current macro definition:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#undef USER_MAX
&lt;/source&gt;

It is an error to use '''#define''' to change the definition of a macro, but it is not an error to use '''#undef''' to try to undefine a macro name that is not currently defined.  Therefore, if you need to override a previous macro definition, first '''#undef''' it, and then use '''#define''' to set the new definition.

{{NOTE|note=
Because preprocessor definitions are substituted before the compiler acts on the source code, any errors that are introduced by &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; are difficult to trace. For example using value or macro names that are the same as some existing identifier can create subtle errors, since the preprocessor will substitute the identifier names in the source code.

Today, for this reason, &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; is primarily used to handle compiler and platform differences. E.g, a define might hold a constant which is the appropriate error code for a system call. The use of &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; should thus be limited unless absolutely necessary; typedef statements, constant variables, enums, templates and [[C++ Programming/Code/Statements/Functions#Inline|inline functions]] can often accomplish the same goal more efficiently and safely.

By convention, values defined using &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; are named in uppercase with &quot;_&quot; separators, this makes it clear to readers that the values is not alterable and in the case of macros, that the construct requires care. Although doing so is not a requirement, it is considered very bad practice to do otherwise. This allows the values to be easily identified when reading the source code.

Try to use &lt;code&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; and {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} instead of &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt;.
}}

===== \ (line continuation) =====
If for some reason it is needed to break a given statement into more than one line, use the '''\''' (backslash) symbol to &quot;escape&quot; the line ends.  For example, 

 #define MULTIPLELINEMACRO \
         will use what you write here \
         and here etc...

is equivalent to

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#define MULTIPLELINEMACRO will use what you write here and here etc...
&lt;/source&gt;

because the preprocessor joins lines ending in a backslash (&quot;\&quot;) to the line after them. That happens even before directives (such as #define) are processed, so it works for just about all purposes, not just for macro definitions.  The backslash is sometimes said to act as an &quot;escape&quot; character for the newline, changing its interpretation.

In some (fairly rare) cases macros can be more readable when split across multiple lines.  Good modern C++ code will use macros only sparingly, so the need for multi-line macro definitions will not arise often.

It is certainly possible to overuse this feature.  It is quite legal but entirely indefensible, for example, to write

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int ma\
in//ma/
()/*ma/
in/*/{}
&lt;/source&gt;

That is an abuse of the feature though: while an escaped newline ''can'' appear in the middle of a token, there should never be any reason to use it there.  Do not try to write code that looks like it belongs in the International Obfuscated C Code Competition.

Warning: there is one occasional &quot;gotcha&quot; with using escaped newlines: if there are any invisible characters after the backslash, the lines will not be joined, and there will almost certainly be an error message produced later on, though it might not be at all obvious what caused it.

===== Function-like Macros =====
Another feature of the #define command is that it can take arguments, making it rather useful as a pseudo-function creator. Consider the following code: 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#define ABSOLUTE_VALUE( x ) ( ((x) &lt; 0) ? -(x) : (x) )
// ...
int x = -1;
while( ABSOLUTE_VALUE( x ) ) {
// ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|
It is generally a good idea to use extra parentheses for macro parameters, it avoids the parameters from being parsed in a unintended ways. But there are some exceptions to consider:
# Since comma operator have lower precedence than any other, this removes the possibility of problems, no need for the extra parentheses.
# When concatenating tokens with the ## operator, converting  to strings using the # operator, or concatenating adjacent string literals, parameters cannot be individually parenthesized.
}}

Notice that in the above example, the variable &quot;x&quot; is always within its own set of parentheses. This way, it will be evaluated in whole, before being compared to 0 or multiplied by -1. Also, the entire macro is surrounded by parentheses, to prevent it from being contaminated by other code. If you're not careful, you run the risk of having the compiler misinterpret your code.

Macros replace each occurrence of the macro parameter used in the text with the literal contents of the macro parameter without any validation checking. Badly written macros can result in code which will not compile or creates hard to discover bugs. Because of side-effects it is considered a very bad idea to use macro functions as described above. However as with any rule, there may be cases where macros are the most efficient means to accomplish a particular goal.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int z = -10;
int y = ABSOLUTE_VALUE( z++ );
&lt;/source&gt;

If ABSOLUTE_VALUE() was a real function 'z' would now have the value of '-9', but because it was an argument in a macro '''z++''' was expanded 3 times (in this case) and thus (in this situation) executed twice, setting z to -8, and y to 9.  In similar cases it is very easy to write code which has &quot;undefined behavior&quot;, meaning that what it does is completely unpredictable in the eyes of the C++ Standard.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// ABSOLUTE_VALUE( z++ ); expanded
( ((z++) &lt; 0 ) ? -(z++) : (z++) );
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

{{NOTE|With the GCC compiler extension called &quot;statement expression&quot; (not standard C++), it is allowed to use statements in an expression, please consult the compiler manual for other considerations, it becomes then possible to only evaluate it once:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#define ABSOLUTE_VALUE( x ) ( { typeof (x) temp = (x); (temp &lt; 0) ? -temp : temp; } )
&lt;/source&gt;

Using inlined templated functions may then be an alternative to macros, removing the problem of side effects inside the argument to the macro.

It is generally good idea to stay away from compiler specific extensions, unless the dependency is planed for. 
}}

and

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// An example on how to use a macro correctly

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
#define SLICES 8
#define PART(x) ( (x) / SLICES ) // Note the extra parentheses around '''x'''
 
int main() {
   int b = 10, c = 6;
   
   int a = PART(b + c);
   std::cout &lt;&lt; a;
   
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
-- the result of &quot;a&quot; should be &quot;2&quot; (b + c passed to PART -&gt; ((b + c) / SLICES) -&gt; result is &quot;2&quot;)

{{NOTE|
'''Variadic Macros'''&lt;br&gt;
A variadic macro is a feature of the preprocessor whereby a macro is declared to accept a varying number of arguments (similar to a variadic function).

They are currently not part of the C++ programming language, though many recent C++ implementations support variable-argument macros as an extension (ie: GCC, MS Visual Studio C++), and it is expected that variadic macros may be added to C++ at a later date.

Variable-argument macros were introduced in the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (C99) revision of the C Programming Language standard in 1999. 
}}

===== # and ## =====
The '''#''' and '''##''' operators are used with the &lt;tt&gt;#define&lt;/tt&gt; macro. Using # causes the first argument after the '''#''' to be returned as a string in quotes. For example 

 #define as_string( s ) # s

will make the compiler turn

 std::cout &lt;&lt; as_string( Hello  World! ) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
		
into 

 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World!&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;

{{NOTE|Observe the leading and trailing whitespace from the argument to &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; is removed, and consecutive sequences of whitespace between tokens are converted to single spaces.}}
		
Using '''##''' concatenates what's before the '''##''' with what's after it; the result must be a well-formed preprocessing token. For example

 #define concatenate( x, y ) x ## y
 ...
 '''int''' xy = 10;
 ...
	
will make the compiler turn

 std::cout &lt;&lt; concatenate( x, y ) &lt;&lt; std::endl;

into 

 std::cout &lt;&lt; xy &lt;&lt; std::endl;

which will, of course, display &lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt; to standard output.

String literals cannot be concatenated using '''##''', but the good news is that this is not a problem: just writing two adjacent string literals is enough to make the preprocessor concatenate them.

===== The dangers of macros =====
To illustrate the dangers of macros, consider this naive macro

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#define MAX(a,b) a&gt;b?a:b
&lt;/source&gt;

and the code

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
i = MAX(2,3)+5;
j = MAX(3,2)+5;
&lt;/source&gt;

Take a look at this and consider what the value after execution might be.  The statements are turned into

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt; 
int i = 2&gt;3?2:3+5;
int j = 3&gt;2?3:2+5;
&lt;/source&gt;

Thus, after execution &lt;tt&gt;i=8&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;j=3&lt;/tt&gt; instead of the expected result of &lt;tt&gt;i=j=8&lt;/tt&gt;! This is why you were cautioned to use an extra set of parenthesis above, but even with these, the road is fraught with dangers. The alert reader might quickly realize that if &lt;tt&gt;a,b&lt;/tt&gt; contains expressions, the definition must parenthesize every use of &lt;tt&gt;a,b&lt;/tt&gt; in the macro definition, like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#define MAX(a,b) ((a)&gt;(b)?(a):(b))
&lt;/source&gt;

This works, provided &lt;tt&gt;a,b&lt;/tt&gt; have no side effects. Indeed,

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt; 
 i = 2;
 j = 3;
 k = MAX(i++, j++);
&lt;/source&gt;

would result in &lt;tt&gt;k=4&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;i=3&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;j=5&lt;/tt&gt;. This would be highly surprising to anyone expecting &lt;tt&gt;MAX()&lt;/tt&gt; to behave like a function.

So what is the correct solution? The solution is not to use macro at all. A global, inline function, like this
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;inline int max(int a, int b) { return a&gt;b?a:b }&lt;/source&gt;
has none of the pitfalls above, but will not work with all types. A template (see below) takes care of this
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;template&lt;typename T&gt; inline max(const T&amp; a, const T&amp; b) { return a&gt;b?a:b }&lt;/source&gt;
Indeed, this is (a variation of) the definition used in STL library for std::max(). This library is included with all conforming C++ compilers, so the ideal solution would be to use this. 
 std::max(3,4);

Another danger on working with macro is that they are excluded form type checking.
In the case of the MAX macro, if used with a string type variable, it will not generate a compilation error.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;MAX(&quot;hello&quot;,&quot;world&quot;)&lt;/source&gt;

It is then preferable to use a inline function, which will be type checked. Permitting the compiler to generate a meaningful error message if the inline function is used as stated above.

==== String literal concatenation ====
One minor function of the preprocessor is in joining strings together, &quot;string literal concatenation&quot; -- turning code like

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello &quot; &quot;World!\n&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;

into

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World!\n&quot;;&lt;/source&gt;

Apart from obscure uses, this is most often useful when writing long messages, as a normal C++ string literal is not allowed to span multiple lines in your source code (i.e., to contain a newline character inside it). The exception to this is the C++11 raw string literal, which can contain newlines, but does not interpret any escape characters. Using string literal concatenation also helps to keep program lines down to a reasonable length; we can write

  function_name(&quot;This is a very long string literal, which would not fit &quot;
                &quot;onto a single line very nicely -- but with string literal &quot;
                &quot;concatenation, we can split it across multiple lines and &quot;
                &quot;the preprocessor will glue the pieces together&quot;);

Note that this joining happens before compilation; the compiler sees only one string literal here, and there's no work done at runtime, i.e., your program will not run any slower at all because of this joining together of strings.

Concatenation also applies to wide string literals (which are prefixed by an L):

  L&quot;this &quot; L&quot;and &quot; L&quot;that&quot;

is converted by the preprocessor into

  L&quot;this and that&quot;.

{{NOTE|For completeness, note that C99 has different rules for this than C++98, and that C++0x seems almost certain to match C99's more tolerant rules, which allow joining of a narrow string literal to a wide string literal, something which was not valid in C++98.}}

==== Conditional compilation ====
Conditional compilation is useful for two main purposes:
* To allow certain functionality to be enabled/disabled when compiling a program
* To allow functionality to be implemented in different ways, such as when compiling on different platforms

It is also used sometimes to temporarily &quot;comment-out&quot; code, though using a version control system is often a more effective way to do so.

*'''Syntax''':
 #if ''condition''
   ''statement(s)''
 #elif ''condition2''
   ''statement(s)''
 ...
 #elif ''condition''
   ''statement(s)''
 #else
   ''statement(s)''
 #endif
 
 #ifdef ''defined-value''
   ''statement(s)''
 #else
   ''statement(s)''
 #endif
 
 #ifndef ''defined-value''
   ''statement(s)''
 #else
   ''statement(s)''
 #endif

===== #if =====
The '''#if''' directive allows compile-time conditional checking of preprocessor values such as created with [[##define and #undef|#define]]. If 
''condition'' is non-zero the preprocessor will include all ''statement(s)'' up to the '''#else''', '''#elif''' or '''#endif''' directive in the 
output for processing. Otherwise if the '''#if''' ''condition'' was false, any '''#elif''' directives will be checked in order and the first 
''condition'' which is true will have its ''statement(s)'' included in the output. Finally if the ''condition'' of the '''#if''' directive and 
any present '''#elif''' directives are all false the ''statement(s)'' of the '''#else''' directive will be included in the output if present; otherwise, nothing gets included.

The expression used after '''#if''' can include boolean and integral constants and arithmetic operations as well as macro names.  The allowable expressions are a subset of the full range of C++ expressions (with one exception), but are sufficient for many purposes.  The one extra operator available to '''#if''' is the '''defined''' operator, which can be used to test whether a macro of a given name is currently defined.

===== #ifdef and #ifndef =====
The '''#ifdef''' and '''#ifndef''' directives are short forms of ''''#if''' defined(''defined-value'')' and ''''#if''' 
!defined(''defined-value'')' respectively. '''defined'''(''identifier'') is valid in any expression evaluated by the preprocessor, and returns true (in this context, equivalent to 1) if a preprocessor variable by the name 
''identifier'' was defined with #define and false (in this context, equivalent to 0) otherwise.  In fact, the parentheses are optional, and it is also valid to write '''defined''' ''identifier'' without them.

(Possibly the most common use of '''#ifndef''' is in creating &quot;include guards&quot; for header files, to ensure that the header files can safely be included multiple times.  This is explained in the section on header files.)

===== #endif =====
The '''#endif''' directive ends '''#if''', '''#ifdef''', '''#ifndef''', '''#elif''' and '''#else''' directives.

*'''Example''':
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #if defined(__BSD__) || defined(__LINUX__)
 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 #endif
&lt;/source&gt;

This can be used for example to provide multiple platform support or to have one common source file set for different program versions. Another example of use is using this instead of the (non-standard) '''#pragma once'''.

*'''Example''':
foo.hpp:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #ifndef FOO_HPP
 #define FOO_HPP
 
  // code here...
 
 #endif // FOO_HPP
&lt;/source&gt;

bar.hpp:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #include &quot;foo.h&quot;
 
  // code here...
&lt;/source&gt;

foo.cpp:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #include &quot;foo.hpp&quot;
 #include &quot;bar.hpp&quot;
 
  // code here
&lt;/source&gt;

When we compile '''foo.cpp''', only one copy of '''foo.hpp''' will be included due to the use of include guard. When the preprocessor reads the line &lt;code&gt;#'''include''' &quot;foo.hpp&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, the content of '''foo.hpp''' will be expanded. Since this is the first time which '''foo.hpp''' is read (and assuming that there is no existing declaration of macro '''FOO_HPP''') '''FOO_HPP''' will not yet be declared, and so the code will be included normally. When the preprocessor read the line &lt;code&gt;#'''include''' &quot;bar.hpp&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in foo.cpp, the content of '''bar.hpp''' will be expanded as usual, and the file '''foo.h''' will be expanded again. Owing to the previous declaration of '''FOO_HPP''', no code in '''foo.hpp''' will be inserted. Therefore, this can achieve our goal - avoiding the content of the file being included more than one time.

==== Compile-time warnings and errors ====
*'''Syntax''':
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #warning message
 #error message
&lt;/source&gt;

===== #error and #warning =====
The '''#error''' directive causes the compiler to stop and spit out the line number and a message given when it is encountered. The '''#warning''' directive causes the compiler to spit out a warning with the line number and a message given when it is encountered. These directives are mostly used for debugging. 

{{NOTE|'''#error''' is part of Standard C++, whereas '''#warning''' is not (though it is widely supported).}}

*'''Example''':
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #if defined(__BSD___)
 #warning Support for BSD is new and may not be stable yet
 #endif
 
 #if defined(__WIN95__)
 #error Windows 95 is not supported
 #endif
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Source file names and line numbering macros ====
The current filename and line number where the preprocessing is being performed can be retrieved using the predefined macros __FILE__ and __LINE__. Line numbers are measured ''before'' any escaped newlines are removed.  The current values of __FILE__ and __LINE__ can be overridden using the '''#line''' directive; it is very rarely appropriate to do this in hand-written code, but can be useful for code generators which create C++ code base on other input files, so that (for example) error messages will refer back to the original input files rather than to the generated C++ code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hobby Ranching can be a very fulfilling experience.  Some elderly people who in their younger days ranched for a living will hobby farm since a large herd is too much to keep up with.  You do not need a huge farm/ranch to raise them though if space is insufficient your cows will become unhealthy, you may violate local by-laws, and even face animal cruelty charges.  However, any facility that is suited to horses is more than sufficient for Cattle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Modular Arithmetic ==
===Introduction===
Modular arithmetic connects with primes in an interesting way. Modular arithmetic is a system in which all numbers up to some positive integer, ''n'' say, are used. So if you were to start counting you would go 0, 1, 2, 3, ... , ''n'' - 1 but instead of counting ''n'' you would start over at 0. And what would have been ''n'' + 1 would be 1 and what would have been ''n'' + 2 would be 2. Once 2''n'' has been reached the number is reset to 0 again, and so on. Modular arithmetic is also called clock-arithmetic because we only use 12 numbers to tell standard time. On clocks we start at 1 instead of 0, continue to 12, and then start at 1 again. Hence the name clock-arithmetic. 

The sequence also continues into what would be the negative numbers.  What would have been -1 is now ''n'' - 1.  For example, consider modulo 7 arithmetic, it's just like ordinary arithmetic except the only numbers we use are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. If we see a number outside of this range we add 7 to (or subtract 7 from) it, until it lies within that range.

As mentioned above, modular arithmetic is not that different to ordinary arithmetic. For example in modulo 7 arithmetic, we have
:&lt;math&gt;3 + 2 = 5 \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;5 + 6 = 11 = 4\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;5 - 6 = -1 = 6 \!&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
3 \times 5 = 15 = 1\\
5 \times -6 = -30 = 5\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We have done some calculation with negative numbers. Consider 5 &amp;times; -6. Since -6 does not lie in the range 0 to 6, we need to add 7 to it until it does. And -6 + 7 = 1. So in modular 7 arithmetic, -6 = 1. In the above example we showed that 5 &amp;times; -6 = -30 = 5, but 5 &amp;times; 1 = 5. So we didn't do ourselves any harm by using -6 instead of 1. ''Why?''

'''Note - Negatives''': The preferred representation of  -3 is 4, as -3 + 7 = 4, but using either -3 and 4 in a calculation will give us the same answer as long as we convert the final answer to a number between 0 and 6 (inclusive).

====Exercise====
Find in modulo 11

1.
:-1 &amp;times; -5
2.
:3 &amp;times; 7
3. Compute the first 10 the powers of 2
:2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ... , 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;
What do you notice?&lt;br&gt; 
Using the powers of 2 find
:6&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 6&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ... , 6&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;
What do you notice again?

4.
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{4} &lt;/math&gt;
i.e. find, by trial and error (or otherwise), all numbers ''x'' such that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4 (mod 11). There are two solutions, find both .

5.
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{9} &lt;/math&gt;
i.e. find all numbers ''x'' such that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9 (mod 11). There are two solutions, find both.

=== Inverses ===
Consider a number ''n'', the inverse of ''n'' is the number that when multiplied by ''n'' gives 1. For example, if we were to solve the following equation
:&lt;math&gt;5x  = 3 \pmod{ 7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
the (mod 7) is used to make it clear that we are doing arithemetic modulo 7. We want to get rid of the 5 somehow. Multiplying it by something to turn it into a 1 would do the job. Notice that
:&lt;math&gt;3\times 5  = 15 = 1 \pmod{ 7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
because 3 multiplied by 5 gives 1, we say 3 is the inverse of 5 in modulo 7. Now we multiply both sides by 3
{|-
|&lt;math&gt;3\times 5 \!&lt;/math&gt;  
|&lt;math&gt;x \!&lt;/math&gt;  
|&lt;math&gt;= 3\times 3 \pmod{ 7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;x \!&lt;/math&gt;  
|&lt;math&gt;= 9 \pmod{ 7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|
|&lt;math&gt;= 2 \pmod{ 7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
So ''x'' = 2 modulo 7 is the required solution.

'''Definition (Inverse)'''
:The inverse of (a number) ''x'' is a number ''y'' such that ''xy'' = 1. We denote the inverse of ''x'' by ''x&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''1/x''.

''' Inverse is unique'''

From above, we know the inverse of 5 is 3, but does 5 have another inverse? The answer is no. In fact, in any reasonable number system, a number can have one and only one inverse. We can see that from the following proof

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
Suppose ''n'' has two inverses ''b'' and ''c''
:&lt;math&gt;b = b \times 1 = b (nc) = (bn)c = 1 \times c = c \!&lt;/math&gt;
From the above argument, all inverses of ''n'' must be equal. As a result, if the number ''n'' has an inverse, the inverse must be unique.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An interesting property of any modulo ''n'' arithmetic is that the number ''n'' - 1 has itself as an inverse. That is, (''n'' - 1) &amp;times; (''n'' - 1) = 1 (mod ''n''), or we can write (n - 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (-1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 (mod ''n''). The proof is left as an exercise at the end of the section.

==== Existence of inverse ====
Not every number has an inverse in every modulo arithmetic. For example, 3 doesn't have an inverse mod 6, i.e., we can't find a number ''x'' such that 3''x'' = 1 mod 6 (the reader can easily check). 

Consider modulo 15 arithmetic and note that 15 is composite. We know the inverse of 1 is 1 and of 14 is 14. But what about 3, 6, 9, 12, 5 and 10? None of them has an inverse! Note that each of them shares a common factor with 15!

As an example, we show that 3 does not have an inverse modulo 15. Suppose 3 has an inverse ''x'', then we have
:&lt;math&gt;3x = 1 \pmod{15} \!&lt;/math&gt;
We make the ''jump'' from modular arithemetic into rational number arithmetic. If 3''x'' = 1 in modulo 15 arithmetic, then
:&lt;math&gt;3x = 15k + 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
for some integer ''k''. Now we divide both sides by 3, we get
:&lt;math&gt;x =  5k + \frac{1}{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
But this cannot be true, because we know that ''x'' is an integer, not a fraction. Therefore 3 doesn't have an inverse in mod 15 arithmetic. To show that 10 doesn't have an inverse is harder and is left as an exercise.

We will now state the theorem regarding the existence of inverses in modular arithmetic.

'''Theorem'''
:If ''n'' is prime then every number (except 0) has an inverse in modulo ''n'' arithmetic.
Similarly
:If ''n'' is composite then every number that doesn't share a common factor with ''n'' has an inverse.

It is interesting to note that ''division'' is closely related to the concept of inverses. Consider the following expression
:&lt;math&gt;6 \times 3^{-1} \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
the conventional way to calculate the above would be to find the inverse of 3 (being 5). So
:&lt;math&gt;6\times 3^{-1} = 6\times 5 = 30 = 2\pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;

We write the inverse of 3 as 1/3, so we think of multiplying 3&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; as ''dividing'' by 3, we get
:&lt;math&gt;6\times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that we got the same answer! In fact, the division method will always work if the inverse exists.

However, the expression in a different modulo system will produce the wrong answer, for example
:&lt;math&gt;6 \times 3^{-1} \pmod{9} \!&lt;/math&gt;
we don't get 2, as 3&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; does not exist in modulo 9, so we can't use the division method.

====Exercise====
1. Does 8 have an inverse in mod 16 arithemetic? If not, why not?

2. Find ''x'' mod 7 if ''x'' exists:
:&lt;math&gt;x = 2^{-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 3^{-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 4^{-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 5^{-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 6^{-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = 7^{-1} \!&lt;/math&gt;

3. Calculate ''x'' in two ways, ''finding inverse'' and ''division''
:&lt;math&gt;x = 28\cdot 7^{-1} \ \ \mbox{(mod 29)} \!&lt;/math&gt;

4. (Trick) Find ''x''
:&lt;math&gt;x = 5^{99} \times (40 + 3^{-1}) \ \pmod{11} \!&lt;/math&gt;

5.
Find all inverses mod ''n'' (n &amp;le; 19)&lt;br/&gt;

===Coprime and greatest common divisor===
Two numbers are said to be coprimes if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1. E.g. 21 and 55 are both composite, but they are coprime as their greatest common divisor is 1. In other words, they do not share a common divisor other than 1.

There is a quick and elegant way to compute the gcd of two numbers, called Euclid's algorithm. Let's illustrate with a few examples:

'''Example 1:'''&lt;br/&gt;
:Find the gcd of 21 and 49.

We set up a two-column table where the larger of the two numbers is on the right hand side as follows
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;smaller&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;larger&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;49&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

We now compute 49 (mod 21) which is 7 and put it in the second row ''smaller'' column, and put 21 into the ''larger'' column.
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;smaller&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;larger&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;49&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Perform the same action on the second row to produce the third row.
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;smaller&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;larger&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;49&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;21&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''7'''&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Whenever we see the number 0 appear on the ''smaller'' column, we know the corresponding ''larger'' number is the the gcd of the two numbers we started with, i.e. 7 is the gcd of 21 and 49. This ''algorithm'' is called Euclid's algorithm.

'''Example 2'''
:Find the gcd of 31 and 101

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;smaller&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;larger&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;31&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;101&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''1'''&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

'''Example 3'''
:Find the gcd of 132 and 200

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;smaller&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;larger&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;132&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;200&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;68&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;132&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;64&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;68&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;64&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;'''4'''&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

'''Important to note'''
# The gcd need not be a prime number.
# The gcd of two different primes is 1.  In other words, two different primes are always coprime.


==== Exercise ====
1. Determine whether the following sets of numbers are coprimes
:# 5050 5051
:# 59 78
:# 111 369
:# 2021 4032

2. Find the gcd of the numbers 15, 510 and 375

==== info -- Algorithm ====
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
An algorithm is a step-by-step description of a series of actions when performed correctly can accomplish a task. There are algorithms for finding primes, deciding whether 2 numbers are coprimes, finding inverses and many other purposes.&lt;br/&gt; You'll learn how to implement some of the algorithms we have seen using a computer in the chapter [[../../../Mathematical Programming/]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Finding Inverses===
Let's look at the idea of inverse again, but from a different angle. In fact we will provide a sure-fire method to find the inverse of any number. Let's consider:&lt;br/&gt;
:5''x'' = 1 (mod 7)&lt;br/&gt;
We know ''x'' is the inverse of 5 and we can work out it is 3 reasonably quickly. But x = 10 is also a solution, so is x = 17, 24, 31, ... 7n + 3. So there are infinitely many solutions; therefore we say 3 is equivalent to 10, 17, 24, 31 and so on. This is a crucial observation.

Now let's consider
:&lt;math&gt;216x \equiv 1 \ \ \mbox{(mod 811)}&lt;/math&gt;
A new notation is introduced here, it is the equal sign with three strokes instead of two. It is the &quot;equivalent&quot; sign; the above statement should read &quot;216''x'' is EQUIVALENT to 1&quot; instead of &quot;216''x'' is EQUAL to 1&quot;. From now on, we will use the equivalent sign for modulo arithmetic and the equal sign for ordinary arithmetic.

Back to the example, we know that ''x'' exists, as gcd(811,216) = 1. The problem with the above question is that there is no quick way to decide the value of ''x''! The best way we know is to multiply 216 by 1, 2, 3, 4... until we get the answer, there are at most 811 calculations, way too tedious for humans. But there is a better way, and we have touched on it quite a few times!

We notice that we could make the ''jump'' just like before into rational mathematics: 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
216a &amp; = &amp; 1 + 811b\\
0 &amp; \equiv &amp; 1 + 163b &amp;\pmod{216}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
We jump into rational maths again

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
216c &amp;=&amp; 1 + 163b \\
53c &amp;\equiv&amp; 1 &amp;\pmod{163}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
We jump once more
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
53c &amp;=&amp; 1 + 163d \\
0 &amp;\equiv&amp; 1 + 4d&amp;\pmod{53}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now the pattern is clear, we shall start from the beginning so that the process is not broken:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
216a &amp; = &amp; 1 + 811b\\
216c &amp;=&amp; 1 + 163b \\
53c &amp;=&amp; 1 + 163d \\
53e &amp;=&amp; 1 + 4d \\
e &amp;=&amp; 1 + 4f \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now all we have to do is choose a value for ''f'' and substitute it back to find ''a''! Remember ''a'' is the inverse of 216 mod 811. We choose f = 0, therefore e = 1, d = 13, c = 40, b = 53 and finally a = 199! If ''f'' is chosen to be 1 we will get a different value for ''a''.

The very perceptive reader should have noticed that this is just Euclid's gcd algorithm in reverse.

Here are a few more examples of this ingenious method in action:

'''Example 1'''

Find the smallest positive value of ''a'':
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
33a &amp; \equiv &amp; 1 \ \ \mbox{(mod 101)}\\
33a &amp;=&amp; 1 + 101b\\
33c &amp;=&amp; 1 + 2b\\
c &amp;=&amp; 1 + 2d\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Choose d = 0, therefore a = 49.

'''Example 2'''
Find the smallest positive value of ''a'':
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
27a &amp; \equiv &amp; 1 \ \ \mbox{(mod 821)}\\
27a &amp;=&amp; 1 + 821b\\
27c &amp;=&amp; 1 + 11b\\
5c &amp;=&amp; 1 + 11d\\
5e &amp;=&amp; 1 + d\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Choose e = 0, therefore a = -152 = 669

'''Example 3'''
Find the smallest positive value of ''a'':
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
34a &amp; \equiv &amp; 1 \ \ \mbox{(mod 55)}\\
34a &amp;=&amp; 1 + 55b\\
34c &amp;=&amp; 1+ 21b\\
13c&amp; =&amp; 1 + 21d\\
13e&amp; =&amp; 1 + 8d\\
5e &amp;=&amp; 1 + 8f\\
5g&amp; = &amp;1 + 3f\\
2g&amp; =&amp; 1 + 3h\\
2i&amp; = &amp;1 + h\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Set i = 0, then a = -21 = 34. ''Why is this so slow for two numbers that are so small? What can you say about the coefficients?''

'''Example 4'''
Find the smallest positive value of ''a'':
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
21a &amp; \equiv &amp; 1 \ \ \mbox{(mod 102)}\\
21a &amp;=&amp; 1 + 102b\\
21c &amp;=&amp; 1 + 18b\\
3c &amp;=&amp; 1 + 18d\\
3d &amp;=&amp; 1\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Now ''d'' is not an integer, therefore 21 does not have an inverse mod 102.

What we have discussed so far is the method of finding integer solutions to equations of the form:
:ax + by = 1
where ''x'' and ''y'' are the unknowns and ''a'' and ''b'' are two given constants, these equations are called linear ''Diophantine equations''. It is interesting to note that sometimes there is no solution, but if a solution exists, it implies that infinitely many solutions exist.

=== Diophantine equation ===
In the [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Primes/Modular Arithmetic|Modular Arithmetic]] section, we stated a theorem that says if gcd(''a'',''m'') = 1 then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (the inverse of ''a'') exists in mod ''m''. It is not difficult to see that if ''p'' is prime then gcd(''b'',''p'') = 1 for all ''b'' less than ''p'', therefore we can say that in mod ''p'', every number except 0 has an inverse.

We also showed a way to find the inverse of any element mod ''p''. In fact, finding the inverse of a number in modular arithmetic amounts to solving a type of equations called Diophantine equations. A Diophantine equation is an equation of the form
:''ax'' + ''by'' = ''d''
where ''x'' and ''y'' are unknown.

As an example, we should try to find the inverse of 216 in mod 811. Let the inverse of 216 be ''x'', we can write
:&lt;math&gt;216x \equiv 1 \pmod{811} \!&lt;/math&gt;
we can rewrite the above in every day arithmetic
:&lt;math&gt;216x + 811y = 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
which is in the form of a Diophantine equation.

Now we are going to do the inelegant method of solving the above problem, and then the elegant method (using Magic Tables).

Both methods mentioned above uses the Euclid's algorithm for finding the gcd of two numbers. In fact, the gcd is closely related to the idea of an inverse. Let's apply the Euclid's algorithm on the two numbers 216 and 811. This time, however, we should store more details; more specifically, we want to set up an additional column called PQ which stands for partial quotient. The partial quotient is just a technical term for &quot;how many ''n'' goes into ''m''&quot; e.g. The partial quotient of 3 and 19 is 6, the partial quotient of 4 and 21 is 5 and one last example the partial quotient of 7 and 49 is 7.

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;smaller&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;larger&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;PQ&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;216&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;811&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;163&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The tables says three 216s goes into 811 with remainder 163, or symbollically:
:811 = 3&amp;times;216 + 163.

Let's continue:
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;smaller&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;larger&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;PQ&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;216&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;811&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;163&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;216&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;53&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;163&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;53&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;13&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Reading off the table, we can form the following expressions
:811 = 3&amp;times; 216 + 163
:216 = 1&amp;times; 163 + 53
:163 = 3&amp;times; 53 + 4
:53 =13&amp;times; 4 + 1

Now that we can work out the inverse of 216 by working the results backwards
:1 = 53 - 13&amp;times;4
:1 = 53 - 13&amp;times;(163 - 3&amp;times;53)
:1 = 40&amp;times;53 - 13&amp;times;163
:1 = 40&amp;times;(216 - 163) - 13&amp;times;163
:1 = 40&amp;times;216 - 53&amp;times;163
:1 = 40&amp;times;216 - 53&amp;times;(811 - 3&amp;times;216)
:1 = 199&amp;times;216 - 53&amp;times;811
Now look at the equation mod 811, we will see the inverse of 216 is 199.

==== Magic Table ====
The Magic Table is a more elegant way to do the above caculations, let us use the table we form from Euclid's algorithm

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;smaller&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;larger&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;PQ&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;216&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;811&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;163&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;216&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;53&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;163&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;53&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;13&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
 
Now we set up the so-called &quot;magic table&quot; which looks like this initially
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Now we write the partial quotient on the first row:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;13&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

We produce the table according to the following rule:
:Multiply a partial quotient one space to the left of it in a different row, add the product to the number two space to the left on the same row and put the sum in the corresponding row.
It sounds more complicated then it should. Let's illustrate by producing a column:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;13&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

We put a 3 in the second row because 3 = 3&amp;times;1 + 0. We put a 1 in the third row because 1 = 3&amp;times;0 + 1.

We shall now produce the whole table without disruption:
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;13&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;15&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;199&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;811&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/th&gt; &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;216&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

We can check that
:|199&amp;times;216 - 811&amp;times;53| = 1

In fact, if the magic table is contructed properly, and we ''cross multiplied and subtracted'' the last two column correctly, then we will always get 1 or -1, provided the two numbers we started with were coprimes. The magic table is just a cleaner way of doing the mathematics.

What do you notice?

=== Chinese remainder theorem ===
The Chinese remainder theorem is known in China as ''Han Xing Dian Bing'', which in its most naive translation means ''Han Xing counts his soldiers''. The original problem goes like this:
:There exists a number ''x'', when divided by 3 leaves remainder 2, when divided by 5 leaves remainder 3 and when divided by 7 leaves remainder 2. Find the smallest ''x''.
We translate the question into symbolic form:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x&amp;\equiv &amp;2 \pmod{3}\\
x&amp;\equiv &amp;3 \pmod{5}\\
x&amp;\equiv &amp;2 \pmod{7}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

How do we go about finding such a ''x''? We shall use a familiar method and it is best illustrated by example:

Looking at x = 2 (mod 3), we make the ''jump'' into ordinary mathematics
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x&amp;\equiv &amp;2 \pmod{3}\\
x &amp;=&amp; 2 + 3a \qquad (1)
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now we look at the equation modulo 5
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2 +  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;3a  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv 3 \pmod{5} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;3a  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv 1 \pmod{5} \! &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;a  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv 2 \pmod{5}  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; a  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 2 + 5b  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Substitute into (1) to get the following
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 2 + 3(2 + 5b) \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = 8 + 15b  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now look at the above modulo 7
:&lt;math&gt;x = 8 + 15b \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
we get
:&lt;math&gt;b \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;

We choose ''b'' = 1 to minimize ''x'', therefore ''x'' = 23. And a simple check (to be performed by the reader) should confirm that ''x'' = 23 is a solution. A good question to ask is what is the next smallest ''x'' that satisfies the three congruences? The answer is ''x'' = 128, and the next is 233 and the next is 338, and they differ by 105, the product of 3, 5 and 7.

We will illustrate the method of solving a system of congruences further by the following examples:

'''Example 1'''
Find the smallest ''x'' that satisfies:
:&lt;math&gt; x \equiv 1 \pmod{3}  \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x \equiv 2 \pmod{5}  \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x \equiv 3 \pmod{7}  \!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Solution'''
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt; x = \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; 1 + 3  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;a \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; 2 \pmod{5} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|
|&lt;math&gt;a \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;2 + 5b \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
now substitute back into the first equation, we get
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;x \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 1 + 3(2 + 5b)  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= 7 + 15b \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv 3 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;b \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = 3 + 7c \!&lt;/math&gt;
again substituting back
{|-
|&lt;math&gt;x \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= 7 + 15(3 + 7c) \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;  = 52 + 15\times 7c \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Therefore 52 is the smallest ''x'' that satisfies the congruences.

===Example 2===
Find the smallest ''x'' that satisfies:
:&lt;math&gt; x \equiv 5 \pmod{11}  \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x \equiv 3 \pmod{7}  \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x \equiv 8 \pmod{9}  \!&lt;/math&gt;

''' Solution '''
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;x \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; = 5 + 11 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;a \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|
|&lt;math&gt; a \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|
|&lt;math&gt; a = 3 + 7b \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
substituting back
:{|-
|align=&quot;right&quot; | &lt;math&gt;x = \!&lt;/math&gt;    || &lt;math&gt;5 + 11(3 + 7b) \!&lt;/math&gt;     
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot; | &lt;math&gt;  = \!&lt;/math&gt;    || &lt;math&gt;38 + 11\times 7b  \!&lt;/math&gt; 
|-
|align=&quot;right&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\equiv \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;8 \pmod{9} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
now solve for ''b''
:{|
| align=&quot;right&quot; | &lt;math&gt;2 + 2\times 7b \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\equiv 8 \pmod{9} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;right&quot; | &lt;math&gt;             b \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\equiv 3 \pmod{9} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;right&quot; | &lt;math&gt;  b            \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;= 3 + 9c \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
again, substitue back
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;x \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; 38 + 11\times 7(3 + 9c) \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                  || &lt;math&gt; = \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;269 + 11\times 7\times 9c \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Therefore 269 is the smallest ''x'' that satisfies the congruences.

7x &amp;\equiv &amp; -3 \pmod{17} \\
x &amp;\equiv &amp;6 \pmod{11} \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== *Existence of a solution* ====
The exercises above all have a solution. So does there exist a system of congruences such that no solution could be found? It certainly is possible, consider:
:''x'' &amp;equiv; 5 (mod 15)
:''x'' &amp;equiv; 10 (mod 21)
a cheekier example is:
:''x'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 2)
:''x'' &amp;equiv; 0 (mod 2)
but we won't consider silly examples like that.

Back to the first example, we can try to solve it by doing:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x &amp; = &amp; 5 + 15k       &amp; \equiv &amp; 10          &amp; \pmod{21} \\
  &amp;   &amp; 15k           &amp; \equiv &amp; 5           &amp; \\
  &amp;   &amp; 3k            &amp; \equiv &amp; 1           &amp; \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
the above equation has no solution because 3 does not have an inverse modulo 21!

One may be quick to conclude that if two modulo systems share a common factor then there is no solution. But this is not true! Consider:
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 4 \pmod{15} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv 7 \pmod{21} \!&lt;/math&gt;
we can find a solution
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;x  = \!&lt;/math&gt; || align=right|&lt;math&gt;     4 + 15k \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt; \equiv 7 \pmod{21} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                     ||align=right | &lt;math&gt;        15k \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt; \equiv 3 \pmod{21} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                     ||align=right | &lt;math&gt;5\times 3k  \!&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt; \equiv 3 \pmod{21} \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
we now multiply both sides by the inverse of 5 (which is 17), we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;3k  \equiv 9 \!&lt;/math&gt;
obviously, ''k'' = 3 is a solution, and the two modulo systems are the same as the first example (i.e. 15 and 21).

So what determines whether a system of congruences has a solution or not? Let's consider the general case:
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a \pmod{m} \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv b \pmod{n} \!&lt;/math&gt;
we have
:&lt;math&gt;x = a + km \!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = b + ln \!&lt;/math&gt;
essentially, the problem asks us to find ''k'' and ''l'' such that the above equations are satisfied.

We can approach the problem as follows
:&lt;math&gt;0 = (a - b) + (km - ln)\,\! &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(ln - km) = (a - b) \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
now suppose m and n have gcd(m,n) = d, and  m = dm&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, n = dn&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. We have
:&lt;math&gt;dln_o - dkm_o = (a - b)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ln_o - km_o = (a - b)/d\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
if (''a'' - ''b'')/''d'' is an integer then we can read the equation mod m&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;ln_o \equiv (a - b)/d \pmod{m_o}\,\! &lt;/math&gt;
Again, the above only makes sense if (''a'' - ''b'')/''d'' is integeral. Also if (''a'' - ''b'')/''d'' is an integer, then there is a solution, as ''m''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; are coprimes!

In summary: for a system of two congruent equations
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a \pmod{m}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv b \pmod{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
there is a solution if and only if
:''d'' = gcd(''m'',''n'') divides (''a'' - ''b'')

And the above generalises well into more than 2 congruences. For a system of ''n'' congruences:
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_1 \pmod{ m_1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_2 \pmod{ m_2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:...
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a_n \pmod{ m_n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
for a solution to exist, we require that if ''i'' &amp;ne; ''j''
:gcd(''m''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,''m''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;) divides (''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - ''a''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)

==== Exercises ====
Decide whether a solution exists for each of the congruences. Explain why.

== To go further ==
This chapter has been a gentle introduction to [[w:Number Theory | number theory]], a profoundly beautiful branch of mathematics. It is gentle in the sense that it is mathematically light and overall quite easy. If you enjoyed the material in this chapter, you would also enjoy [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Further Modular Arithmetic|Further Modular Arithmetic]], which is a harder and more rigorous treatment of the subject.

Also, if you feel like a challenge you may like to try out the [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Primes/Problem Set | Problem Set]] we have prepared for you. On the other hand, the [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Primes/Project/The Square Root of -1 | project]] asks you to take a more investigative approach to work through some of the finer implications of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">EJB Query Language is used to define what a finder method of an Entity bean should return. The EJB 1.1 specification offered no way to query entity beans. It resulted in different query languages for different application servers. When Sun published the EJB 2.0 specification it added a query language to find entity beans more easily.

== Basic Syntax ==

 SELECT_CLAUSE FROM_CLAUSE [WHERE_CLAUSE]

Both SELECT_CLAUSE and FROM_CLAUSE must be used but WHERE_CLAUSE is optional.

== Finder methods ==
Finder methods are used to return a single or multiple Entities from the storage. The finder method is defined in entity's home interface. The return value of a finder is the beans remote interface or a collection of entity beans implementing the remote interface which were found.

=== Basic finder method ===
The simplest possible EJB-Query would be one which return all Entities in a given table.

 @ejb.finder
   signature=&quot;Collection findAll()&quot;
   query=&quot;SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT(p) FROM Player p&quot;

As you can see, the EJB-Query looks nearly the same as a standard SQL query, although it's not the name of the tables but the name of the EJB classes and it's not the name of the columns but the name of the EJB properties. The only difference is the terminal ''object(o)'' which is equivalent to: take all columns of a given row and transform the result into an entity bean instance.

=== Finder method with WHERE clause ===

Look at the example above. It differes from the finder method above only that a conditional for the players which should be returned is added.

 @ejb.finder
   signature=&quot;Collection findByPosition(java.lang.String position)&quot;
   query=&quot;SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT(p) FROM Player p WHERE p.position = ?1&quot;

This finder method returns all Players which play at the position which is entered by parameter one. If you have more than one parameter you can use them in your query with ?2, ?3 and so on.

=== Finder method which operates on relation ===
EJB Query differs from SQL especially if you want to use different relational tables.

 @ejb.finder
    signature=&quot;Collection findByCity(java.lang.String city)&quot;
    query=&quot;SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT(p) FROM Player p, IN (p.teams) AS t WHERE t.city = ?1&quot;

This query return all players whose team plays in the city given with parameter one. In other words: return all Players who play in the team which is situated in a given city.

== Select methods ==
In opposite to finder methods select methods might return a persistence field or other entity beans. So it's possible to define a select method which returns a primitive data type instead of a complete object.

=== Example ===
&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{TODO|Add examples.}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

====Thermal noise====
;Thermal Agitation Noise: Also known as '''Johnson noise or White noise'''.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P_n \propto\ T\;\delta\!f = k\,T\;\delta\!f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;where ''k'' = [[wikipedia:boltzmann|Boltzmann's]] constant = 1.38x10&lt;sup&gt;-23&lt;/sup&gt;J/K
::''T'' = absolute temperature, K = 273 + °C
::''&amp;delta; f'' = bandwidth of interest
::''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = maximum noise power output of a resistor
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P_n = \frac{V^2}{R_L} = \frac{\left(\frac{V_n}{2}\right)^2}{R} = \frac{V_n^2}{4R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;V_n^2 = 4RP_n = 4RkT\;\delta\!f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;V_n = \sqrt{4kT\;\delta\!f\;R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
====Shot Noise====
{{wikipedia|shot noise#In electronic devices}}
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;i_n = \sqrt{2ei_p\;\delta\!f}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where ''i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = r.m.s. shot-noise current
:''e'' = charge of an electron = 1.6x10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;C
:''i&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = direct [[Electronics/Diodes | diode]] current
:''&amp;delta; f'' = bandwidth of system

==Noise Calculations==
====Addition due to several sources====
noise voltages: &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;V_n1 = \sqrt{4kT\,\delta\!f\,R_1}&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;V_n2 = \sqrt{4kT\,\delta\!f\,R_2}&lt;/math&gt;...and so on, then&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;V_{n,tot} = \sqrt{{V_n1^2}+{V_n2^2}+...} = \sqrt{4kT\,\delta\!f\,R_{tot}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where R&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+...
====Addition due to Cascaded Amplifier stages====
&lt;center&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+R'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R_{eq} = R_1 + \frac{R_2}{A_1^2} + \frac{R_3}{{A_1^2}{A_2^2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==Analog Noise Models==

===CMOS===

===BJT===

== Noise in digital circuits: ==

== Methods of reducing noise ==

=== Differential signaling ===

Differential signaling is a method of transmitting information electrically by means of two complementary signals sent on two separate wires. The technique can be used for both analogue signaling, as in some audio systems, and digital signaling, as in RS-422, RS-485, PCI Express and USB.

=== Good grounding ===

An ideal signal ground maintains zero voltage regardless of how much electrical current flows into ground or out of ground.

When low-level signals travel near high currents, their return currents shouldn't be allowed to flow in the same conductor. Otherwise, noise such as AC ripple on the high current will modulate the low-level signal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome to Wikibooks ==
You are certainly welcome to create this Wikibook, and I find it exciting that this project is going to be used for an Instructional Technology class.  For all contributors to this Wikibook, I would suggest that you try to adhere to the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] for sub pages (or sub-modules) of this Wikibook.  There is some substantial documentation regarding how to edit here on Wikibooks and other Wikimedia project, but unfortunately it is mainly of a quick reference nature and not necessarily a how-to book at the moment.

If you have any questions about how to edit these pages, how to get that little bit of extra flair to your page, or how to &quot;upload&quot; images or sound files to these pages, feel free to stop by the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] and add a comment or two.  That page is generally frequenented by long term users, and is a good place to ask general questions that may have answers that are hard to find or simply havn't been discussed before.

Make use of the discussion pages as well.  Each content page will also have a discussion page where you can try to leave a comment (like this one) that can debate the merits of the content or talk about how to organize the information.  This tool has been very valuable, and is a very vital part of the collaborative process, particularly when two or more people are in a disagreement over what should be added to a controvercial subject.  Subjects like [[w:Abortion]] and [[w:George W. Bush]] have a surprising track record and are well written and edited dispite huge differences of opinion over those topics.  The same can occur here in this Wikibook as well if you take advantage of the tools available to you.

This project (Wikibooks) has been going now for about two years, and there has been some recent increase in usage and activity throughout just about every area.  I hope that you find your experience here on Wikibooks to be enjoyable, and that after you are through with this course work that you will consider to stay and help us out in making this a better resource for the educational community in general.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:26, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergeto|Cantonese/Pronunciation}}
The Cantonese characters pronunciation consists of three elements: syllable onset(聲母), syllable nucleus(韻母) and tone(聲調). A character consists of syllable onset(though some rare characters does not have this element), following by a syllable nucleus, with a tone for each character.

The concept of syllable onset and syllable nucleus can be explained by examing the english word &quot;sing&quot;. When you pronounce this word, try to divide it to &quot;s-&quot; and &quot;-ing&quot;. Note that the &quot;s-&quot; determines the shape of your mouth, and the &quot;-ing&quot; is the actual voiced part. That's the concept of syllable onset and syllable nucleus respectively. The tone is a special feature in Chinese language. There is a total of nine tones, and each character belongs to one of them. Note that there is no concept of stress in Chinese words - each word has only one syllable.

==Syllable onsets==
There are totally 19 syllable onsets in Cantonese. The following table shows their pronunciation guide:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Syllable onset&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Simlilar English pronunciation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Notes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''b''' in '''b'''oy&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;p&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''p''' in '''p'''aper&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;m&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''m''' in '''m'''other&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;f&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''f''' in '''f'''ather&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;d&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''d''' in '''d'''og&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;t&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''t''' in '''t'''alk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''n''' in '''n'''o&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;l&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''l''' in '''l'''ove&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;g&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''g''' in '''g'''et&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;k&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''k''' in '''k'''eep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ng&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;---&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;To pronounce &quot;ng&quot;, first adjust everything in your mouth (tougne, shape of lips, etc) to the position as you would when pronouncing &quot;g&quot; and &quot;k&quot;, now the way to say is same as those except that you are using your nose to voice it. ''(Voice files will be added later)''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;h&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''h''' in '''h'''ello&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;gw&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;---&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pronunciation simliar to &quot;g&quot;, but start with round-shaped lips, gradually forming the lip shape as your are pronouncing the English letter &quot;a&quot;. Try to think it as a &quot;go-a(the '''a''' in b'''a'''r)&quot; pronounced together as a single syllable.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;kw&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''qu''' in '''qu'''iet&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Same as above, but similar to &quot;k&quot;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;z&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;---&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The sound of &quot;z&quot; is similar to the English letter &quot;j&quot;, but the difference is like &quot;z&quot; and &quot;zh&quot;. First the tip of your tougne should be touching your lower incisors, and while pronouncing, gradually move your tougne to your palate. ''(Voice files will be added later)''&lt;!-- I know the explanation is unclear, those who understands how to pronounce &quot;z&quot; please help me correct it--&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ts&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;---&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Same as &quot;z&quot;, but air should be agitated from your mouth.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''s''' in '''s'''ong&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;j&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;(similar to the Spanish &quot;j&quot;)'''y''' in '''y'''ou&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;w&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''w''' in '''w'''as&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The objective of this book is to provision the reader with a more in depth knowledge of the material covered at A-Level in mathematics. It includes a focus on the definition and proof of concepts rather than the understanding of these concepts, which the reader is assumed to be somewhat familiar with. It is organised by concept and is neither comprehensive nor syllabus specific. Instead it is intended to allow the keen student the opportunity to gain a greater understanding of the subjects covered at A-Level and hopefully perform better in the field of mathematics as a consequence. It should not therefore be used as a sole reference for examinations and many of the explanations will contain more depth than the average student is expected to reproduce in an exam.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What is the ''“me”'' that makes one think in a manner that is peculiar to only oneself?

The total ''“me”'' is easy to imagine; it must be the accumulation of events and understandings that one has experienced during one’s life, added to the genetically inherited abilities and aptitudes present in one’s brain.&lt;ref&gt;Possessing particular body attributes (e.g., long muscular legs that might predispose one to be a runner) contribute to building the mind’s ''“me”'' concept, of course.&lt;/ref&gt; As we have noted, molecular memories and the understandings they represent are stored as linked paths and networks of greater or lesser significance through everyone’s brain—the whole constituting the “mind,” just part of it forming the “me” concept.&lt;ref&gt;The same principles (i.e. networks of varying connective strengths and thresholds) have been used by David Fogel and Kumar Chellapilla in designing a computer program that evolves through survival and replication of successful variants as it competes with similar programs to play the game of checkers. The program can now beat an average human player. This achievement is important because the program was given only the rules of the game—it taught itself how to win. (This is radically different from the IBM computer program Deep Blue that defeated the chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. That computer was given a data-base of many thousands of possible moves and their consequences, and simply ran through them to determine the most advantageous move to make.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The same has happened to us. Over the ages the universe has taught us how to win, and our memories, neural links, constructs, and the knowledge implicit in the words and language we use, sum up what we each understand of the rules of the game in the conglomerate we call our mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Computer programs that, once given a target and some parameters, recursively design to optimize their output, are now reality. In essence, these programs mimic the evolutionary process that life uses. See Steven Johnson, “Darwin in a Box,” ''Discover'', August 2003, 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; This collection, together with the biochemical activities and emissions of the cells of one’s body, makes the ''“me”'' think and act the particular way that one does. As Descartes said, ''cogito, ergo sum'' (“I think, therefore, I am”).

Second-level thinking, i.e., when animals analyze situations and recognize their implications, then act upon (or dismiss) what they have understood, may or may not involve consciousness of self. If the situation is totally independent of their own individuality (for example, for an antelope when a lion walks nearby) then an awareness of their own unique identity is not called for (only the need to include the knowledge of such things as their proximity to the lion, wind direction, etc., in their analysis). But, if, in order to correctly assess a situation, an animal needs to separate its identity from that of others (for example, when in a family or grooming group, where knowing one’s social standing, and how others act and react toward one’s presence and actions), then a degree of consciousness of self must be present.

The recognition of personal identity, a separate self or me would have occurred very early in the development of third-level thinking ability. Cassirer knew this when he stated, &quot;it is language that makes his existence in a community possible; and only in society, in relation to a 'Thee', can his subjectivity assert itself as a 'Me'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, ''Language and Myth'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-level thinking, using words and languages, provides the consciousness we are familiar with, where thoughts can be consciously directed and where moral questions are formulated. This is the detached self that can examine (with some difficulty) what is happening at the second level.

As we have discussed, everything we “know” is built, held and maintained as second-level constructs—developed by second-level thinking that builds neural networks which form and link the memories. These give us the mental images of objects, events and ideas that we carry in our mind’s eye; they are our own Platonic cave-wall shadows. It is the mental construct of one’s own body that one “sees” when experiencing an out-of-body sensation (that of looking down upon oneself). Out-of-body sensations occur as the conscious third level of thought is (semi-consciously) drawn by prevailing circumstances&lt;ref&gt;See [[../Revelations And Conversions/The Source Of Revelations#cite_note-12|The Source Of Revelations, footnote 13]] for a discussion of oxygen starvation and other considerations.&lt;/ref&gt; to picture mind images of one’s body as though they were separate and distinct (i.e., disconnected) from the mental networks that denote self.

It was third-level thinking that made some early scientists postulate that there was an imp, or homunculus, directing mental traffic within the brain; the imp turns out to be the mind’s second-level activities.

Consciousness, then, amounts to an awareness of the existence of an assemblage of thoughts and memories within the brain, and of the particular significance that these have to the possessor. The awareness occurs at the third level, and it is the presence of mental constructs that creates the sense of permanency to one’s concept of self. Consciousness is aware of second-level activities, but their rapidity and subconscious independence make them hard to analyze. Second and third-level activities block ready access to first-level consciousness; training and practice aimed at decreasing third and second-level thinking activities (meditation, for instance) may occasionally allow first-level awareness to make itself known (as an experience, not as a detailed representation of the external environment).&lt;ref&gt;Interesting work that can be related to our understanding of consciousness has been conducted by two scientists, using a methodology suggested by Snyder. Young and Ridding used transcranial magnetic stimulation to inhibit frontotemporal neural activity in volunteers, so preventing language and concept manipulation and reducing the volunteers to a savant-like state (where skills demonstrated are always associated with the possession of an exceptional memory). Over a quarter of these volunteers then showed an improved ability to draw pictures and perform mental calculations (although not to the degree frequently demonstrated by some savants).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In our terms, what may have been demonstrated is that savants (and some of the volunteers) could be directly accessing aspects of their first-level consciousness that have been stored for some reason. It may be this (relatively perfect, i.e., unencumbered by second or third-level thought manipulations) memory that is being used by savants, to perform, apparently instantaneously, certain kinds of mathematical calculation and to accurately draw what may have been seen only once a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
See Douglas S. Fox, “The Inner Savant,” in the February, 2002 edition of ''Discover'', 44-49. Also Donald A. Treffert and Gregory L. Wallace, “Islands of Genius,” in the June 2002 edition of ''Scientific American'', 76-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research demonstrates that subconscious biochemical and electrical flows occur before we become consciously aware of them. (We should expect this because mental images must first form subconsciously to be recognized and analyzed for relative significance; only then can those of importance be selected and fed to our conscious third-level thinking where, finally, they may be put into words.) This is why the semi-consciousness we are occasionally aware of seems to have a life of its own. It does. Thoughts at the second level run their own course before we become aware of them. This effectively detaches them from our third-level thinking, and makes them seem to exist as an independent body of thought within our minds.&lt;ref&gt;Much has been written about consciousness. For an excellent discussion, read Antonio R. Damasio, ''The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness'' (New York: Harcourt Brace &amp; Company, 1999). (N.B. Terminology differs between Damasio’s text and mine. For instance, what I have termed “first-level thinking” Damasio describes as “core consciousness.” Damasio, a research neurologist who maintains a clinical practice, describes patients’ disorders to add weight to his hypotheses. He provides many references for further reading.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Conscience is an entirely different issue. In essence, exercising one’s conscience amounts to expressing one’s concept of truth. This, therefore, represents both the highest and the most fundamental level of life’s activities: the highest, because life survives by determining the true nature of its environment; the most fundamental, because life does this to most effectively exploit its resources in order to live. Unfortunately, the true nature of things is readily distorted; by one’s sensors and one’s understanding of signals received by them, and by the words and mental constructs we and others use. Truth, to the extent that it exists, is often costly to obtain; finding it requires openness to the widest possible range of experiences, facts and ideas, then a constant debate over their meaning, with oneself and with others.

Conscience is often associated with morality—knowing “right” from “wrong,” and behaving accordingly. In that morality is always relative to its time and circumstances, it is a lesser concept than the concept of conscience. Most theologies recognize this, some going as far as saying that one’s conscience is God-given and must be followed, even if it contradicts religious teachings.

Most biologists dismiss any discussion of an animal conscience. For example, Hauser, in ''Wild Minds'', states categorically (page 253) that animals have no moral system. But I think that advanced animals may possess a conscience of some degree because they do seek to understand the true nature of their environment, and they can separate a knowledge of “self” from that of another. Animal altruistic behaviour, which has not infrequently been observed, may demonstrate the operation of a conscience and of animal morality.&lt;ref&gt;Frans de Waal, in ''The Ape and the Sushi Master: Cultural Reflections of a Primatologist'' (New York: Basic Books, 2001) shows how primates, particularly chimpanzees, develop complex social relationships, communicate, possess cultures and exhibit empathy and sympathy.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is an important difference between asking, “what is life’s purpose?” and asking, “what is life’s meaning?”

The first question is by far the most important, for we seek an answer that must be universally and permanently true. All of life, wherever it is and in whatever form it exists, is expected to be subsumed within the answer to the question about life’s purpose. “To do God’s will” might be the reply of many to this question, giving an answer that, they would claim, applies to all things and all creatures for all time. The point to note is that, although the chosen “life’s purpose” might vary from one person to another, every choice selected must meet the criteria of universality and timelessness.

The second question, asking life’s meaning, is clearly of less significance, because subjective and multiple answers are acceptable and even expected. Everyone is quite willing to accept different replies from the same person for we fully recognize that “life’s meaning” can change from day to day. “Life’s purpose” has no such freedom.

The answer to the question of life’s purpose turns out to be the key that unlocks the puzzle of life’s meaning. We can be sure of this, because whenever someone says that life has meaning for them, we always find that they are expressing a feeling that stems from acting to achieve one or more purposes they deem to be important.

Many do not recognize that they live their daily lives happily striving to attain a multitude of purposes. The desire to live comfortably, to provide for a family, to be without pain, to be emotionally satisfied, to enjoy life; all these and thousands of similar phrases are statements of purpose, all more or less distant from conscious thought, but all significant to our minds as they go about their task of making the decisions that guide our daily activities.

We sometimes consciously chose one or two purposes to have particular significance for us, and their achievement may then take primacy over others. Getting a degree, saving money to buy a house, or helping charitable organizations might be examples, and many of us spend much time and effort supporting the attainment of goals such as these. However, whether or not we recognize the fact, every one of our activities is directed toward the achievement of one purpose or another.

Of course, we often react to emotions and feelings as well. But these actions are taken to satisfy or alleviate the emotions or feelings that prompted them; thus acting to satisfy our emotions is also acting to achieve a purpose. The difference is that these are not purposes directed by conscious thoughts, they are responses to body chemicals. Thus, they are usually more primitive or animal-like in nature (although emotional responses to music probably pertain to relatively recent evolutionary developments).

The happy feeling that we are living a meaningful life, or that life possesses meaning for us, is a by-product of a mind that is doing its job well by directing its support system (the body) to meet a multitude of purposes. The feeling stems from the mind being able to work relatively stress-free, both consciously and subconsciously, because the tasks we perform, the thoughts we arrange, the decisions we make, are directed toward some worthwhile, i.e. purposeful, end.

It is pointless to directly seek the meaning of life. Feeling that life is meaningful is the normal state—a feeling of well-being, when the bloodstream is relatively free of stress-causing chemicals, because the mind is working efficiently and effectively, making purpose-directed decisions. Such a mind has no need to instruct the release of anxiety-causing chemicals.

There is no physical or biological requirement to feel that life has meaning. Living entities can eat, survive and reproduce, without any such feeling, as the daily lives of bacteria, plants and insects presumably affirm. In organisms capable of conscious thought, however, there is a definite requirement for such thought to be purpose-directed. Solving problems and making decisions rationally requires a desire to achieve some purpose—this systematizes conscious thought. Working rationally is the activity that makes the mind valuable to survival, thus ensuring its own survival.

People who lack valued purposes are susceptible to depression, when nothing seems worthwhile and life can feel meaningless. The cure is not to directly seek meaning, but to find a purpose worthy of being valued and sought, then use this purpose to make decisions and guide actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Science and mathematics reign supreme in our understanding of the universe because, as has been elsewhere noted, each scientific fact and theory, each mathematical statement, has been exhaustively tested for inconsistencies and illogic before being given membership among the hierarchy of theories and facts that make up the totality of these disciplines. Our underlying belief in the universe’s causality requires this rigour, as any discrepancy, until resolved, threatens to demolish our whole understanding of the cosmos.

The mark of a true scientist is that he or she willingly investigates discrepancies. The hallmarks of scientific method are that its findings are repeatable, measurable, and universal in implication and relationship, yet simple in concept once understood. Although humans have uncovered a great deal about the universe, we have much to learn, and the meticulousness of the scientific method is the only sound approach.

Most religions, in contrast, do not tolerate such a questioning attitude and, consequently, many have become less and less in tune with reality.&lt;ref&gt;The Anglican bishop of Edinburgh, Scotland, said as much when he stated that the primary job of bishops has become that of preserving the church’s existence by resisting change. This, he claimed, will lead to the death of the institution. (See John Allemang, “The blaspheming bishop,” ''The Globe and Mail'', March 16, 2002, F6.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Religions fail us when they ignore our need to be rational. Of course, anyone can hold any belief or statement to be true. There is no necessity (other than the mind’s own operational need for rationality) to demand a logical relationship between subordinate statements and apex belief in religion. Each statement could be taken at face value, true and absolute in itself. Indeed, many people (particularly those who follow their religion’s fundamental text conscientiously) seem able to accept most, and sometimes all, of their religion’s statements as absolutes, and require no inter-connectivity between them. But this treats us all as though we were automaton, incapable of thought, simply being required to believe and to act as we are told.

(Preachers do not usually ignore the inter-relationships within their religion. In my limited experience, preachers spend much time attempting to show links between a belief in God and subordinate statements [such as the existence of Heaven and Hell], or between actions and consequences. Possibly this is because preachers are more rational than most of us, and have been drawn to religion because of the need to find an authority for the moral decisions their mental constructs require them to address. If this is even partially so, it is truly ironic to realize that it is the universe’s very own rationality expressing itself within their minds that has induced them to become leaders in an arena where rationality has become subordinated to faith!)

As earlier stated, we can believe anything we choose. Our beliefs will cause us no harm, as long as they do not cause us to act in a way that reality will punish. Thus, we can believe, to use an extreme example, that the moon is made of green cheese, that the man-in-the-moon is our real father, and that we will all go to be with him after death. We can construct a subsystem of subordinate beliefs, all guiding us in our daily decision making, and all assuring us that we will be rewarded with an afterlife amid green cheese. And we can live more or less happily within this belief system and die content.

We can sustain these beliefs forever, provided we somehow filter and modify any incoming stimuli that fails to support them. For instance, we could believe in a cheesy moon as long as we did not spectrally analyze moon light, and we could continue to believe in moon heaven for as long as we did not physically visit the moon. Others could go, but they could not return to report its true nature and so challenge our beliefs, for it is clear that our green-cheese belief would become untenable after the return from a moon landing. (Of course, this is exactly why a belief in heaven or paradise can exist.)

All belief systems run the risk of unravelling when forced to confront reality. The only belief systems that survive close encounters with the real world are those that are based upon the rationality of the real world. The less our belief system agrees with reality, the more difficult following that belief becomes.&lt;ref&gt;We can believe, for instance, that the world will feed twice as many people as it supports now, or that chloroflorocarbons do not harm the ozone layer. But, if our beliefs are incorrect, then life for our descendants will not be as comfortable as it may be for us.&lt;/ref&gt; We can enjoy our beliefs for as long as we like, but reality will compel us to revise such beliefs as soon as they create situations which threaten our existence.&lt;ref&gt;Thus, for example, we no longer believe, as many of us once did, that radical Islamists can be ignored because they are simply harmless theologians.&lt;/ref&gt;

We stand at this juncture in our current religions. Many of our traditional beliefs have become less convincing. Reality keeps pulling at the tangled skein of religious thought, attempting to correct false assumptions and misunderstandings. More and more, we become obligated to ask if current religions really are the best source of guidance in contemporary issues. Moral decisions are in danger of becoming little more than political trade-offs at the parish level. Matters relating to population control or gene manipulation, for example, that need a global consensus if such decisions are ever to amount to anything of significance, cannot even be raised at the international level for fear of the religious conflict this would create. Surely a global civilization can never be established until conditions like these are corrected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creativity==
To be creative, our thoughts must stop following the well worn neural paths they are accustomed to travelling. Thus, we start the creative process when we (mentally) say “no.” By saying “no” to any particular thought, we force our minds to conceive alternatives, to search for different neural routes among our existing store of memories, to look for new links. Let me provide a couple of examples.

Consider an artist who paints a picture that is appealing and sells well. He or she might churn out several paintings of like vein without thinking and live well. But, other than the first painting, this is being productive, not creative. To be creative, the artist must first say “no” to some aspect of his or her work. Some large or small part of it must not be produced by rote; it has to be produced as the result of a conscious effort to discover and present something new. A novel way of using titanium white, an insight into the nature of anything, a new way of presenting an emotional experience, a rational discovery, anything at all, as long as it produces an informing&lt;ref&gt;One thing it must have, in my opinion, is something to say. Meaningless daubs do not constitute art, no matter how original. The daubs should represent the artist’s best attempt to convey a new understanding that he or she has discovered. This what distinguishes art from the inane.&lt;/ref&gt; entity that is unique. The refusal to repeat what has been done before, because there must be a better way, is the act that initiates creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Of course, it takes a great deal more than this for the piece to have merit: here I’m just talking about the act of being creative.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, consider a manager, heading a division within a factory producing widgets. There are opportunities galore to be creative; all such a person need do is think, “No, there must be a better way of doing this,” then work out what that might be. On the other hand, the manager may not be faulted for thinking little and creating nothing, being paid for his efforts, and going home knowing that he has done his job, content. (But, somehow, perhaps, feeling a little incomplete, for he has simply managed an operation, not led. To lead others one must first be creative.)

Everyone can be creative. And we all are, some of the time. We have all created many things, suggested a different approach, changed a routine, come up with a new thought, improved upon the past. Each time, in a moment prior to each occasion, we would have, in effect, said “no,” and this would have stopped us from repeating what we may have done many times before.

Routine living, simply repeating with minor, externally induced, variations what has been done before, is not being creative. No improvements—no increases in life’s quality—are produced, and life stagnates. It is the creative acts of millions who have lived before that has given us everything we have that animals do not.

When we refuse to allow our thoughts to follow their usual pathways, the search for new neural associations begins. Finding them completes the act of creativity; new links are made, new memories laid down, our mind’s store of constructs enlarges, and our future abilities increase. Creativity adds to oneself as well as gives to others.

==Free Will==
[[../Thinking/Thinking And The Universe|Thinking And The Universe]] noted that we discover how the universe and its contents operate by examining the cause-and-effect relationships that tie events together. It was emphasized that nothing happens in isolation; every object and every event is linked through a chain of causality to everything that existed before and to everything that exists currently. Not one iota can change without being brought about by some prior event happening.

But, if no change can occur without being caused by some prior event, which itself must have had a prior cause, and so on and so on, backwards in time to the universe’s beginning, then how can free will exist? How can any individual have any thought that hasn’t been pre-programmed into the cause-and-effect network that exists throughout the universe?

Moreover, if free will does not exist, how can anyone be responsible for their actions? And if no one can be held accountable, then no one should be disciplined for anything they do.

This problem has agitated theologians and philosophers for centuries, and has never been satisfactorily resolved.

Intuitively we feel that we do have free will. We all think that we are free to make any decision we like, and most of us expect to be held accountable for the decisions we make and the actions we carry out as a result of those decisions. So there is some explaining to be done—where does causality give way to allow free will?

Possibly the answer is simple. It may be that causality does not apply to single particle events.&lt;ref&gt;This solution has occurred to others, see White and Gribbin, Stephen Hawking: ''A Life in Science'', (London: Penguin Books, 1992), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; What follows is an elaboration of what is meant by this statement, and some evidence supporting the premise.

We think of particles as discrete objects, having mass and able to move from place to place (factors that we can easily measure) because this is our direct experience of the (large and small) objects  that we encounter everyday. However, if particles are small enough (about the size of an atom) scientists find that their true nature is not that simple.

One of the peculiarities we find, is that we can never know simultaneously the position and momentum&lt;ref&gt;Momentum = mass x velocity, and velocity is a term that includes both speed and direction of movement.&lt;/ref&gt; of single particles such as an atom or an electron. This is because any time we try to measure either of these properties, the act of measuring one changes the other. For example, light photons reflecting from a particle that, once detected, should tell us the information we seek, actually give the particle a backward kick as they bounce off. This shifts the particle’s position in an unknown way. It’s a bit like trying to find out what a falling feather is doing by poking at it with a stick. Heisenberg developed the Uncertainty Principle as a description of this problem in 1927. (It precipitated much free-will discussion among scientists and philosophers at the time.)

Another unexpected feature of particle behaviour is that, if we send a beam of them (or even shoot them, one at a time) through two thin parallel slits to make an image on a screen, rather than the expected two lines appearing on the screen, we see several parallel lines of varying density (called an interference pattern). Moreover, these lines are being drawn by a succession of many single hits. Now, on our everyday scale, objects like bullets can’t produce interference patterns. But waves can, so our explanation of such occurrences is that particles show “duality”; they move as if they were waves, but hit targets as if they were bullets.

Quantum mechanics helps physicists solve conundrums like these. This discipline has determined that energy exists as waves of interacting energy fields and that matter is actually bunched-up packets of waves (or photons). (You will remember that Einstein showed that matter and energy were different forms of the same thing, so quantum mechanics and the Theory of Relativity support each other’s explanations.) Since waves are spread-out entities, the position of the particle they represent&lt;ref&gt;Remember, single particles travel as waves, but interact with matter—on hitting a screen, for instance—at only one point, thus appearing again as though it were a particle.&lt;/ref&gt; can only be calculated as a probability of being at any particular place. (For instance, a scientist might say, “If a photon were to hit this screen, it is 60% likely to hit at this spot.”) This may be the first clue in resolving our free will enigma.

The existence and behaviour of “virtual particles” might be another clue that causality does not apply to particles. Myriads of virtual particles constantly flicker into and out of existence everywhere (obtaining the energy to do so from the “vacuum energy” of space, see [[../The Universe/The Expanding Universe|The Expanding Universe]]). They are called “virtual” because they cannot be directly detected. Their occurrence was predicted by Heisenberg, and they are found by looking for the real particles and antiparticles they create. (These created particles and antiparticles immediately destroy one another; it is the leftovers from this destruction that scientists observe.) The comings and goings of the unseen originating virtual particles are completely unpredictable from our point of view within the universe. Since the behaviour of these particles is unpredictable, the results they produce are also unpredictable. Causality seems not to come into play on very small events in our universe.

Observations such as these suggest that tiny particles,&lt;ref&gt;Surprisingly, relatively large particles (e.g., atoms and even small molecules—including &quot;buckyballs&quot;, geodesically configured, 60-atom, molecules of carbon) can exhibit wave behaviour.&lt;/ref&gt; virtual or real, possess properties that are somewhat different from those exhibited when the same particles form large conglomerations. The observations suggest that, at the grassroots level, only probabilities exist. These probabilities build to become statistical certainties as the particle groupings becomes bigger. Once large enough, their behaviours exhibit the causality upon which the laws of physics depend, and that allows scientists to explain so much. In short, predictable causality is not possible (and absolute certainty does not exist) for events involving objects of small dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Because energy &quot;waves&quot; define a particle's position as a probability, any particle exists in innumerable possible (quantum) states. This property is being further explored in order to design “quantum computers,” because possessing multiple states allows multiple computations to occur simultaneously. Calculations requiring hundreds of thousands of years to compute on today’s computers could be carried out in less than a second using a quantum computer. See Michael A. Neilsen, “Rules for a Complex Quantum World,” ''Scientific American'', November 2002, 66-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

So much for causality. Now, for free will.

Thinking, as we have noted, can actually be observed occurring in the brain. Imaging scans reveal that electrically charged ions travel along neural axons and prompt chemical transmissions across synapses to neighbouring neurons. But ions, we remember from our school science class, are atoms or tiny groups of atoms that have lost or gained electrons. That is, they are very small particles.

Now we have all we need to allow free will to exist. We exercise free will when we first say “no.”&lt;ref&gt;Although we may subsequently change our mind and say &quot;yes&quot;. It is the act of not automatically following our routine (i.e., construct determined) behaviour without first thinking (be it physical or mental behaviour) that marks an act of free will. Free will activity requires a conscious assessment of the pros and cons of alternative behaviours before a decision or an action is taken.&lt;/ref&gt; (As stated in the above postscript “Creativity,” this is exactly what we do to start the creative process.) Subsequent, conscious, third-level thought, capped by a decision, completes the act. This process consciously overrules, or at least re-thinks, any decision that may have been made by prior thinking, including that done at the second-level subconscious in our mind.&lt;ref&gt;It is important to remember that subconscious second-level thinking always races ahead of conscious second-level realization. At any time, subconscious “summaries” may nudge into the conscious second-level of thought whereupon third-level thinking (where words are used) may take over. (At any point along this sequence of events, the body might be directed to act upon what is occurring within the brain/mind.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A free will choice is a consciously made decision. It is the conscious acceptance or rejection of what the subconscious offers, made explicit when acted upon, spoken or written. The fortuitous occurrence of any stress-relieving, subconscious-thinking that hits upon a new answer, does not constitute an act of free will. Only if this new answer is subsequently recognized for what it is, and consciously analyzed, then accepted (or rejected), displacing existing answers (or lack of answers), does the act of free will occur.&lt;/ref&gt; We are able to do this, because causality does not force small particles (particularly chemical neurotransmitters travelling between synaptic gaps) to trace previously determined paths.

There we have it! We possess free will because small particles are not causally constrained; they obey probability laws which only become certainties when large numbers are involved. We can say “no,” and be responsible for creating an original decision.

(For what it’s worth, we might note that we exhibit no free will at all when we just “go with the flow.” All flexibility and freedom disappears when multiple entities merge, be they particles, photons, ions travelling along existing neural pathways, or mobs of people.)

==A Revelation==
A [[../Conclusion to Part Three|“revelation”]] can be experienced that takes a person from from simply thinking that an idea could be true, to believing that it is true. Its sudden, totally unexpected arrival; its mental fireworks and fascinating light trails; its prolonged accompanying feelings of certainty, exultation and joy; and its ability to direct my actions even now, are all a matter of natural biochemistry. With the loss of its original wonder, and the expectation of never again experiencing its magic, comes a degree of sadness. But, it also brings the knowledge that something similar, something fully explainable and rational, must have happened to many people, many times in the past. Each one of history’s prophets and mystics who claimed to have received divine intervention, with its accompanying brightness and light, surely experienced a similar phenomenon. Scientists, perceiving a sudden solution to a problem that had long occupied their thoughts, have reported similar happenings, sometimes adding that it was as though the universe had spoken to them. These feelings, as noted in [[../Revelations And Conversions/The Source Of Revelations|The Source Of Revelations]], do not emanate from some external consciousness, some universal spirit; they come from the individual’s own second-level subconscious mental activities.

Is it sad to say goodbye to the notion that these exotic experiences are proof that a higher Being exists, that some divine force is slowly but certainly bringing enlightenment to us? I don’t hold so, for this imposes a dependency and subordination that harks back to the days when superstition and fear ruled the human mind. The idea of being manipulated by a god apportioning ideas in this manner is quite distasteful to me. I do not like to think that any god worthy of its title would do this to any of its creations.

Is it distressing to know that our thinking is not being supported or even directed by stimuli received from a god—to know that we are acting all alone? No; not at all. To the contrary, to know that life, starting from scratch and with absolutely no outside help, is actually on a journey towards comprehending the entire universe is far from troubling—it is magnificent. It is inspiring to think that any single one of us might add another piece to the elucidation of the puzzle. It is exhilarating to know that, as infinitesimal as humans may be on the grand scale of things, they are nevertheless slowly unravelling the nature of the universe, and, through the understanding this brings, gaining some measure of power over fragments of the cosmos itself.

To think that some distant descendant of ours might someday control all! None of the religions I have read about give life and living such an overwhelming sense of purpose and destiny to me. They may have done so, to some people at one time, and they may still do so, to other people today. But not to me. What makes my life meaningful to me is the thought that some of my actions might, through the later efforts of others, contribute morsels toward the eventual evolution of oB.

Mechanics is a broad subject, relating to the behaviour and interaction of physical objects. A more specific definition is that this transcends pointlessness because mechanics is one of those broad abstract ideas that one acquires a definition of by studying its specifics rather than by summarising in a single sentence. With that in mind, we consider its basic concepts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gödel’s Theorem==
Kurt Gödel, in a paper published in 1931, proved that any mathematical system that includes the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, and so on) contains questions whose answers can neither be proved nor disproved using the axioms to be found within that system. This is now known as Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. It implies that there are many mathematical truths that can never be proved, and, by extension, that any system will contain questions that cannot be answered from within that system. Since any meaningful questions that we might ask about the nature of any possible supersystem will inevitably involve use of the natural numbers, there are questions we will never be able to answer. Asking if our universe was “designed to meet some kind of purpose,” is just one such question.

Another way of using Gödel’s theorem to address why one is unable to understand everything from within a system, is as follows. A system is complete when all statements (or their negations) can be proved from within that system. Systems can be proved to be consistent, i.e. free from contradictions, but only by involving a larger frame of reference, which then requires an even larger system to prove its consistency, and so on. In short, we require information that is only available from outside of our universe to determine the accuracy of any answer to any question that can be raised within the universe. In other words, we can never know the answers to questions like, “does God exist?” or, “what is the universe’s purpose in existing?” because we cannot obtain information about what exists beyond the boundaries of our universe.

In effect, Gödel is saying that we can never know anything fully and completely. Thus, even the very best of our scientific understanding is ultimately unverifiable.

Some might say that if this is true, then what is the point of doing anything. Why bother to develop a universal religion, for instance? The answer, of course, is that we need one just as much as we need an understanding of how things work, because both improve the quality of our lives. Time enough to stop doing our best after we are dead!

==General Systems Theory==
The basic concepts underlying General Systems Theory&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Bertalanffy, ''General Systems Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications'' (New York: George Braziller, 1968).&lt;br/&gt;
F. Kenneth Berrien, ''General and Social Systems'' (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; are simple, once the terms employed are recognized and their meaning understood. The theory’s power stems from its generalisability, for all systems (whether living or non-living, small or large) demonstrate the same principles.

General Systems Theory can be summarized as follows.

A system is a processing complex of interrelated parts that acquires supplies and turns them into something else. Thus, a person can be called a system, for each individual takes in oxygen, nutrients and water, processes them, and turns out movement, growth, and bodily waste. A factory can be called a system, for it takes in raw materials and energy, carries out operations, and turns out manufactured goods and waste.

Physical and biological systems exist everywhere; they range in scale and form from primitive Archaean life to galactic clusters, and the same systems terminology applies to all.

No system within our universe is “closed.” In other words, there is no system within the universe whose boundary is impermeable to everything. For example, the Earth receives and processes energy from the Sun; the Sun was formed from earlier Milky Way galactic dust, and radiates energy that interacts with the galaxy’s particles; all galaxies exert gravitational pulls upon one another (so their motions are interdependent), and so on. An alternative way of expressing this property is to state that all systems are “open.”

Thus, all systems (except, possibly, the universe itself) are subsystems of larger supersystems, and, in particular, the biological system is a subset of the physical system. In other words, life is a subsystem of the universe.

We cannot tell if our universe is a subsystem of a larger universe. If there is no linkage to anything external, if the universe is entirely self-contained, and neither takes in nor gives out any form of material, then it is closed. If our universe is somehow related to (i.e., exchanges information, energy and/or matter with) a larger Universe, then it is open.

Systems are dependent upon, and thus controlled by, their various supersystems. This fact becomes readily apparent when a system can no longer obtain needed resources from its environment (its supersystem) and shuts down. It is also demonstrated when a system’s outputs are so excessive or aggravating that its supersystem (its environment) can accept no more, and the resulting back-pressure (a.k.a. feedback) shuts down the system’s operations.

The criteria that determine what we can do, or what we are able to produce, are all to be found in the way our supersystems react to our behaviour. Our supersystems can reject (partially or fully) or accept (partially or fully) our outputs. (For example, a rejection by family, friends, employer or society can soon effect our welfare.) Conversely, supersystem acceptance creates the demand for more of the same output and thus encourages more of the same processing activity.

General Systems Theory terminology can be used to increase our understanding of the problem-solving and decision-making processes described in [[../Solving Problems/]] and [[../Making Decisions/]]. Thus, the supersystem (earlier termed the environment) provides the criteria that determine the success or failure of its subsystems’ behaviours. Physically existing supersystems exhibit and enforce many real criteria, and we make practical decisions successfully by knowing and respecting these. Similarly, mentally existing supersystems (i.e. major constructs) exhibit and enforce many abstract criteria, and we make moral decisions successfully by knowing and respecting these.

==The Conservation Laws==
As the Conservation Laws have been referred to several times in the text, it might be useful to say a little more about them.

Conservation Laws state that, amid all the changes that occur throughout the universe, certain quantities and qualities (for instance, the total amount of energy/mass, momentum, charge, spin, parity, etc.) are always conserved. The value of each (although not necessarily the form) after an interaction is always the same as the value of each before. These laws explain why, for instance, a perpetual motion machine cannot be built. (Interacting system-parts generate heat which is lost to the surrounding environment. Thus the machine loses energy and eventually stops.) Conservation laws explain why there is a property we call inertia. (We feel a force termed inertia when, for instance, we push an object to start it moving. Accelerating an object in this way changes its velocity, and this means we have added to its momentum. Since momentum must be conserved, it must be taken from somewhere; in this case from our hand and body, and, ultimately, from the Earth, reducing its spin (i.e., its angular momentum) a tiny fraction. The inertial force we feel is our body’s reaction [Newton’s Third Law of Motion] to the force that transfers momentum from the Earth to the object.)

The several Conservation Laws are likely to be sub-manifestations of one comprehensive law that we have not yet discovered. Superstring theory may soon be able to tell us more, not only about the Conservation Laws, but also about why certain physical constants are just right for our universe to exist and to create and nourish life. Superstring theory, in Witten and Townsend’s M-theory version, can now account for the existence of the known forces (gravity, electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear), showing that they may all be derivatives of minute vibrating strings 10-35 meters or less in length, and existing in either 10- or 26-dimensional hyperspace. Superstring theory exercises the minds of many physicists and cosmologists (the first group, because it may be the elusive TOE/GUT [Theory Of Everything or Grand Unified Theory] long searched for, and cosmologists, because it predicts and allows for the existence of other universes.)

Some seemingly inexplicable phenomena (such as the behaviour of virtual particles, or the instantaneous transmission of quantum states, as well as time-travel and teleportation [both recently demonstrated to exist&lt;ref&gt;Pairs of “entangled” photons (i.e., identical entities that share common origins and properties) have been separated and sent along optical fibres in opposite directions a distance of ten kilometres before being made to randomly choose and take one of several, equally possible, paths. The two photons always make identical decisions, even though the distance separating them when this decision is made greatly exceeds the distance any form of radiation could travel in the time available to make the choice. In fact, identical random decisions are apparently made instantaneously. (This behaviour is already being discussed as the possible basis for an uncrackable encryption code that the military or banks might use.) Although predicted by quantum mechanics, the phenomenon has yet to be understood. An external Universe might be just what’s involved, with information that controls supposedly random behaviour being instantly passed through to our universe, in a way that makes this information appear to us as being in two places at once. If this is the case, then our universe is actually (although possibly restrictedly) open.&lt;br/&gt;
A team of Australian scientists have recently teleported a laser beam; that is, they destroyed it in one location then reconstructed its identical copy in a new location, one meter distant.&lt;br/&gt;
(Also see Anton Zeilinger, “Quantum Teleportation,” in ''Scientific American'', April 2000, 50-59.)&lt;/ref&gt;]) might represent a window through which we may glean a little knowledge about the possible existence of any such super-universes.

Our universe may be just an adjunct of a larger Universe, with the larger Universe retaining ultimate control. Control by a super-Universe could be rigid, creating nothing more than a fully deterministic sub-universe if the connections between the two were entirely inflexible. However, this seems not to be the case. Wave/particle duality and the laws of conservation allow minuscule events unlimited freedom to act, as long as conglomerate activities obey the conservation constraints (see also the earlier discussion on free will).&lt;ref&gt;It is intriguing to recognize that causality and the Conservation Laws implies that our universe is always retaining the ability to return to any of its earlier forms.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, our universe’s existence could be simply a manifestation of nothing, just as branches of mathematics can be created from definitions rather from actuality. All that is needed is for the whole to sum to zero, and that sum to be maintained regardless of how its parts manifest or become manipulated (a condition maintained by causality and described by the Conservation Laws).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Theories related to life’s creation and its evolution are still being proposed. In the 1960’s Francis Crick, Leslie Orgel and Carl Woese independently proposed that RNA preceded proteins in evolution, and introduced the idea of an early “RNA world.” In 1983, Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman found evidence that RNA can act as a catalyst, so supporting the RNA world theory.&lt;ref&gt;The ribonucleotides in RNA are more readily synthesized than the more complicated deoxyribonucleotides in DNA. Most importantly, RNA can replicate and store genetic information.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current thinking posits that early RNA exchanges occurred laterally (within a commune of different cells), rather than generationally (from parents to offspring), as DNA now replicates. The former may have facilitated many primitive evolutionary developments, and has been found to occur in bacteria.

An alternative theory, put forward by Graham Cairns-Smith, suggests that an inorganic genetic system is likely to have existed before the RNA world, possibly one involving the irregular distribution of cations since found in clays.

Ideas and findings such as these may help us to replicate possible early life forms in the laboratory. That we will create life from scratch one day is not much doubted by any biologist (although some prefer that we never make the attempt). However, the methodology we use to succeed may not be the way that life started (on this planet or elsewhere in the universe), because there are likely to be many ways that life could begin. We will probably use water as its basic ingredient,&lt;ref&gt;Water is plentiful throughout space, but any fluid could be used because fluids readily transport energy-providing resources and molecules from place to place. Gases (and high temperature plasmas) are fluids, and life may have originated in such environments.&lt;/ref&gt; and we already know the other elements and molecules from which Earthly life is constructed. However, it is not a matter of which ingredients to use, the problem is how to assemble these to form a self-contained processing system.

A web search for articles relating to the creation of life or the discovery of extraterrestrial life forms will yield many other interesting details. [[../Life And Exploiting/]] adds a further note to this discussion of life’s beginning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Anything and everything is possible when fantasizing about the future. Everyone has their own views, and the great majority, we know, will turn out to be wrong. For what little they might be worth, here are some conjectures concerning the possible development of a universal religion.

'''25-year achievements''': A suitable meta-purpose is envisioned, and its legal definition as a universal purpose is agreed upon. Public awareness programs are developed and initiated. Political, financial, and religious support is being sought. National and international groups are being formed. Media and public relations units are active. Possible administration, legal, accountability, and other organizational structures necessary for the continuance of the universal purpose project are being discussed.

'''50-year achievements''': The universal purpose is used by 20% of the world’s governments to guide their decision making in such areas as law, genetics, population, pollution, world aid, trade, and exploitation-control.

'''100-year achievements''': The universal purpose has been adopted by 25% of the world’s population, and varieties of a universal religion, headed by this purpose, are being used by them to make moral decisions in arenas where their personal religion provides no answers.

'''250-year achievements''': Self-sustaining, off-world colonies have been built on several of the sun’s planets or their moons and are supplying Earth with rare minerals; the continuation of any indigenous life forms found there is protected by the tenets of the (now commonly accepted) universal religion. Colony ships are on their way to several hospitable exoplanets.

'''500-year achievements''': Information exchanges between humans and intelligent alien life are becoming common occurrences. The possible need to reformulate our meta-purpose, universal purpose and universal religion (and its moral codes) is debated in light of what we learn.

'''1000-year achievements''': Interchanges between numerous other-world species are facilitated by the adoption of a universal meta-purpose that guides the manner by which life’s continuing evolution is supported.

Clearly many other targets have to be met, if any of this is to come to pass. But, look back the same number of years into our past: what changes have humans wrought during that short span. Then look ahead. All might become reality—if we take courage and act upon our dreams.

      <text xml:space="preserve">203.200.10.35, I don't know if you'll see this, but this is what I took from the Vedic Civilization article on Wikipedia:

The main deities of the Vedic pantheon were Indra, Agni (fire), and Soma. Other deities were Varuna, Surya (the Sun), Mitra, Vayu (the wind). Goddesses included Ushas (the dawn), Prithvi (the Earth) and Aditi. Rivers, especially Sarasvati, were also considered goddesses.

I noticed you added Brahma, Vishnu, and the other one whose name I can't spell :) as the most important Gods. I thought they didn't become important until much later, after the Vedic civilization.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 15:06, 25 August 2005 (UTC)


As far as I know (and I am sure being a part of Vedic Civilization / Hindu) that the followings were not part of Vedic Civilization. They were however a part of Indus Valley Civilization but not the vedic.

The Ashvamedha or horse sacrifice 
The Purushamedha or human sacrifice. 
Rituals concerning demonology and magic. 

Vedic rituals never included any magic, sacrifice etc.

==Indus Valley Civilization?==
This section was added by the anon above; it sounds like the Indus Valley Civilization, not the Vedic. I'll remove it for now until someone can verify it:

&quot;The cities of the Vedic people were divided into two parts, both covered by walls. The inner region of cities contained the administrative block along with the town centre, king's palace, main temple and living quarters of important persons of the city. The outer regions were inhabited by the general public, and contained buildings such as markets. Cities had roads running from north to south and east to west, dividing the city into squares. Their cities also had drainage systems, much like the cities of today.&quot;--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 05:45, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

I can't read the original sanskrit in my browser (konqueror), does anyone know how to make them work?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I will ignore special relativity for the time being and consider Newtonian space and time.

==Space==
For our purposes Space is the background in which mechanics takes place. Before we can say more than this we require a better understanding on the concepts of co-ordinates.
===Co-ordinates===
Co-ordinates are simply a collection of labels. As an example consider telephone numbers in an office building. I can label all of the rooms in the building (assuming they all have phones) by the phone number of the room. This would then be a set of co-ordinates. I could also label the rooms by a room number, this is another set of co-ordinates. Co-ordinates are useful in that they let me specify something by a label (like room number) but they are in no way fundamental, at least from the perspective of modern mechanics.
Notice that with the case of rooms in an office there are many ways one could form co-ordinates of the office. If one had a directory of room numbers and phone numbers then one could convert from one set of co-ordinates to another if one should so choose. This is useful because in mechanics sometimes it is better to operate in one set of co-ordinates rather than another. In the case of the office if you are looking for Dave in Room 112 then one wouldn't use the telephone number of 112 to go looking for it. Rooms generally have room numbers on their doors, not their phone numbers. But if you were going to phone Dave you would find his room number rather useless unless you converted to the phone number (via the phone directory).
In mechanics we specify position via co-ordinates. That is we assign to each location of interest a label, almost always a number. NEED SOME EXAMPLES HERE.
Just as when looking for someone in a building, in mechanics one must pick sensible co-ordinates to get something done. When is one co-ordinate system better than another? This is something you have to learn or intuit via problems, which is why just looking at a text book is a waste of time in mathematics, you will need experience if you are to solve problems in mechanics. Experience will usually allow you to pick, based on the 'I've seen one like this before' principle.
We could have more than one number to specify a location via co-ordinates. For example consider a building with many floors. The rooms might be numbered 1, 2, 3 etc. on each floor. If I say to you to go to room 43, you wont be able to unless I tell you what floor it is on. If I say go to room 43 on floor 4 you will be able to find the room in question. We now have two co-ordinates, the room number and the floor number. This is the way most people first meet co-ordinates - on a graph, where the two values indicate the location.

===Dimensions===
Dimensionality is difficult to pin down. One simple way to think of dimensionality is to define it as the number of numbers needed to give a label to every point in some small region in a space. In our previous example we could if we wanted just use phone numbers to classify all the rooms, so the space could be thought of as one dimensional (the space in this case is the list of rooms, not the spatial distributions of the rooms, which is something different). Ordinary space is three dimensional, I can classify every position in space using three numbers. An example of a set of three numbers I could use would be my distance from three (distinct, non-colinear) points. I could also classify my position using cartesian co-ordinates, or by my distance from some point and the angle the line from said point to my position to two fidicule directions.
In this sense ordinary space is 3 dimensional. Sometimes we examine problems in less dimensions because additional dimensions are superfluous or we can generalise from special cases. This is another clever trick one must learn to become truly proficient at mechanics, know when you can reduce the number of dimensions in a problem, you will correspondingly reduce the complexity of the problem and make a solution much easier to find.

==Time==
If one wanted, an entire book on what time is could be written. But we want a simple definition. In short time is defined to make motion look simple, an in a desperate effort to correspond to psychological time. Another way to think about time is to define it empirically. Time is something that is measured by clocks.
For the purposes of mechanics we define time to be a parameter which always increases, and which a set of devices known as clocks will agree upon at some given configuration of our system (an instant). Put another more simplistic way, time is something that all good clocks will agree upon at any one instant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Work ==
Work is a special name given to the (scalar) quantity

&lt;math&gt; W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{x}.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is work and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is force on the object and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is displacement. Essentially this integral is the component of the force in question in the direction of the displacement, times the displacement.  If the force is constant and the object travels in a straight line, this reduces to

&lt;math&gt;W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{x} = Fx \cos \theta \ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is work and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is force on the object and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is displacement. Take note of the dot product.

We say that W is the &quot;work done by the force, F.&quot;  Notice that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; need not be the total force on an object, just the force we are looking at.  It makes sense to ask what is the work done by a given force on an object.  Notice also that the work done by the sum of two forces acting on an object is the sum of the work done by the forces acting individually on the object.  This gives rise to the interpretation that work is that it is the energy transferred to the body by a force that acts on it.  (Of course negative work is energy transferred from the body).  This is the whole point of even considering work.

For, say we had a total force &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; acting on an object.  Then the work is

&lt;math&gt; \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = \int m \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} \cdot d\vec{r} = m \int \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} \cdot \vec{v} dt = m \int \vec{v} \cdot d\vec{v} = \Delta (\frac{1}{2}mv^2) = \Delta KE &lt;/math&gt;

This simply uses Newton's second law in the first step and a substitution in the integral.  This states that the work done by the ''total'' force on an object is the change in kinetic energy of the object.  For example, if you hold an apple, then move the apple down a little bit then stop, what is happening?  Surely the potential energy of the apple has changed, so someone is doing work even though there is no change in kinetic energy -- how can that be?  We must consider all the forces.  Gravity did work on the apple, but the apple did work on you (you did negative work on the apple) -- you have absorbed the energy!  So there really is no paradox after all.

In a very special case, it happens that the quantity of work does not depend on how you move a particle around, but only on the beginning and ending points.  Such a field is called &quot;conservative.&quot;  It means that we can introduce a potential.  Gravity is such a conservative force, amazingly, which is why we can talk about the &quot;potential energy&quot; of an object.  It is just shorthand for saying the work it takes to move the object from somewhere (the reference point) to wherever we are talking about.  Consequently, the change in kinetic energy equals the negative change in potential energy, which basically states that the total energy of the system is constant.  This is in fact why such a force is called conservative -- it conserves mechanical energy!

Dissipative forces, such as friction (it always eats up energy) are sometimes called non-conservative forces.  This is somewhat of a mistake because on the molecular level, the forces really are conservative.  However, it is often nicer to just say that energy is not conserved in a given scenario, even though we know full well that it is disappearing into the motion of atoms, or heat.  You will hear many people say that energy is not conserved in a given situation, but of course it is; energy is always conserved.

It turns out that a force is conservative if and only if the force is &quot;irrotational,&quot; or &quot;curl-less&quot; which has to do with vector calculus.  But for all of our purposes, there ''are'' no non-conservative forces!

However, just to quantify everything, we have the work done by a non conservative force is the change in the ''total'' energy of the body.

== Power ==
Power is the rate of doing work. Thus we have

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{dW}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

So,

&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{d}{dt}(\vec{F} \cdot \vec{x})&lt;/math&gt;,

and for forces that do not vary over time becomes

&lt;math&gt;P = \vec{F} \cdot \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

This means that if the force is acting perpendicular to the velocity, the speed does not change, because the work is zero so the change in kinetic energy is zero.  But wait, how can that be, since a force necessarily accelerates something?  It is accelerating it, it is changing the direction of travel -- acceleration means the derivative of the ''vector'' velocity, not the magnitude of velocity.  In fact, this tells us that the component of force in the same direction as velocity is responsible for (and only for) changes in the magnitude of the velocity, and the component of force perpendicular to the velocity is responsible for (and only for) changes in the direction of the velocity.  Just to quantify this a little bit, it can be shown that

&lt;math&gt;\vec{a} = ||v|| \vec{T} + \frac{||v||^2}{\rho} \vec{N}&lt;/math&gt;

where a is acceleration, v is the velocity, T is the unit tangent vector (tangent to the path of the particle and consequently parallel to the velocity vector), N is the unit normal vector (perpendicular to the tangent vector and in the direction of the derivative of the tangent vector, which you can picture by drawing two pretty close tangent vectors on a curve), and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of curvature, which is essentially the radius of the circle which closest fits the path at the point (the radius of curvature of a circle is the radius of the circle, and the radius of curvature of a straight line is infinity).  All this business is not really necessary for understanding physics, but if you understand it is will help you understand what is going on.  Notice that the second term is the centripetal acceleration -- this is in fact where we get the formula for it.

Finally, just writing out the definition of power to look pretty, if the work is done at a changing rate, then

&lt;math&gt; P = \frac{dW}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

If the work is done at a constant rate, then this becomes

&lt;math&gt; P = \frac{W}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Pressure ==
Pressure is the force per unit area. 

&lt;math&gt; P = \frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

== Torque ==

&lt;math&gt; \vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \; \mathbf{x} \; \vec{F} \ &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \tau = rF \sin \theta \ &lt;/math&gt;

Torque is the &quot;rotational force&quot; applied as part of circular motion, such as the force making the wheels of a car turn. In the SI unit system, torque is measured in Newton-metres.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definitions and Basics==

A linear equation system is a set of linear equations to be solved simultanously. A linear equation takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;a_1*x_1+a_2*x_2+\ldots+a_n*x_n=b \quad ,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;n+1 \,&lt;/math&gt; coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_0 \ldots a_n \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \,&lt;/math&gt; are constants and &lt;math&gt;x_1 \ldots x_n \,&lt;/math&gt; are the n unknowns. Following the notation above, a system of linear equations is denoted as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
a_{11}*x_1+a_{12}*x_2+\ldots+a_{1n}*x_n &amp; = &amp; b_1 &amp; \\
a_{21}*x_1+a_{22}*x_2+\ldots+a_{2n}*x_n &amp; = &amp; b_2 &amp; \\
                                       &amp;\vdots&amp;   &amp; \\
a_{m1}*x_1+a_{m2}*x_2+\ldots+a_{mn}*x_n &amp; = &amp; b_m &amp; \quad .
\end{matrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;

This system consists of &lt;math&gt;m \,&lt;/math&gt; linear equations, each with &lt;math&gt;n+1 \,&lt;/math&gt; coefficients, and has &lt;math&gt;n \,&lt;/math&gt; unknowns which have to fulfill the set of equations simultanously. To simplify notation, it is possible to rewrite the above equations in matrix notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}\quad .\,&lt;/math&gt;

The elements of the &lt;math&gt;m \times n \,&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} \,&lt;/math&gt; are the coefficients of the equations, &lt;math&gt;a_{ij} \,&lt;/math&gt; and the vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b} \,&lt;/math&gt; have the elements &lt;math&gt;x_i \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_i \,&lt;/math&gt; respectively. In this notation each line forms a linear equation.

==Over- and Under-Determined Systems==
In order for a solution &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\,&lt;/math&gt; to be unique, there must be at least as many equations as unknowns. In terms of matrix notation this means that &lt;math&gt;m \ge n \,&lt;/math&gt;. However, if a system contains more equations than unknowns (&lt;math&gt;m&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) it is very likely (not to say the rule) that there exists no solution at all. Such systems are called '''over-determined''' since they have more equations than unknowns. They require special mathematical methods to solve approximately. The most common one is the '''Least-Squares-Method''' which aims at minimizing the sum of the error-squares made in each unknown when trying to solve a system. Such problems commonly occur in measurement or data fitting processes.

&lt;div style=&quot;border:thin solid grey;padding:10px;margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;example&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Assume an arbitrary triangle: suppose one measures all three inner angles &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta, \gamma&lt;/math&gt; with a precission of &lt;math&gt;\pm 0.2^{\circ}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore assume that the lengths of the sides a, b and c are known exactly. From trigonometry it is known, that using the law of cosines one can compute the angle or the length of a side if all the other sides and angles are known. But as is known from geometry, the inner angles of a planar triangle always must add up to &lt;math&gt;180^\circ \,&lt;/math&gt;. So we have three laws of cosines and the rule for the sum of angles. Makes a total of four equations and three unknowns which gives an over-determined problem.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Triangle.Labels.svg|400px|a triangle]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;m&lt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; the problem arises, that the solution is not unique, as one unknown can be freely chosen. Again, mathematical methods exist to treat such problems. However, they will not be covered in this text.

This chapter will mainly concentrate on the case where &lt;math&gt;m=n\,&lt;/math&gt; and asumes so unless mentioned otherwise.

==Exact Solution of Linear Systems==

Solving a system &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A x} = \mathbf{b} \,&lt;/math&gt; in terms of linear algebra is easy: just multiply the system with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; from the left, resulting in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;. However, finding &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is (except for trivial cases) very hard. The following sections describe methods to find an exact (up to rounding-errors) solution to the problem.

====Diagonal and Triangular Systems====

A diagonal matrix has only entries in the main diagonal:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{ij}\equiv 0 \; \forall \; i \neq j&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; in such a case is simply a diagonal matrix with inverse entries, meaning

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mbox{diag}(1/a_{ii})\quad .&lt;/math&gt;

It follows, that a diagonal system has the solution &lt;math&gt;x_i = b_i/a_{ii}&lt;/math&gt; which is very easy to compute.

An upper triangular system is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;a_{ij}=0 \quad \forall j &lt; i \quad,&lt;/math&gt;

and a lower triangular system as

:&lt;math&gt;a_{ij}=0 \quad \forall j &gt; i \quad.&lt;/math&gt;

Backward-substitution is the process of solving an upper triangular system

:&lt;math&gt;
x_i =
\begin{cases}
  b_i / a_{ii} \quad &amp; \mbox{if} \; i=N \\
  \frac{1}{a_{ii}}\left( b_i - \sum_{j=i+1}^{N}{a_{ij} x_j} \right) \quad &amp;\mbox{else} \quad.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Backward-substitution on the other hand is the same procedure for lower triangular systems

:&lt;math&gt;
x_i =
\begin{cases}
  b_i / a_{ii} \quad &amp; \mbox{if} \; i=1 \\
  \frac{1}{a_{ii}}\left( b_i - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}{a_{ij} x_j} \right) \quad &amp;\mbox{else} \quad.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;



===Gauss-Jordan Elimination===

Instead of finding &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; this method relies on row-operations. According to the laws of linear algebra, the rows of an equation system can be multiplied by a constant without changing the solution. Additionaly the rows can be added and subtracted from one another. This leads to the idea of changing the system in such a way that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; has a structure which allows for easy solving for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;. One such structure would be a diagonal matrix as mentioned above.

Gauss-Jordan Elimination brings the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; into diagonal form. To simplify the procedure, one often uses an adapted scheme. First, the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and the right-hand vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; are combined into the augmented matrix

:&lt;math&gt;
  \left [ \mathbf{A},\mathbf{b} \right ] = 
  \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots a_{1N} &amp; b_1 \\
                 \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots        &amp; \vdots \\
                 a_{N1} &amp; a_{N2} &amp; \cdots a_{NN} &amp; b_N
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;



To '''illustrate''', consider an easy to understand, yet efficient algorithm can be built from four basic components:

* ''gelim'': the main function iterates through a stack of reduced equations building up the complete solution one variable at a time, through a series of partial solutions.

* ''stack'': calls ''reduce'' repeatedly, producing a [[stack]] of reduced equations, ordered from smallest (2 elements, such as &lt;ax = b&gt;) to largest.

* ''solve'': solves for one variable, given a reduced equation and a partial solution. For example given the reduced equation &lt;aw bx cy = d&gt; and the partial solution &lt;x y&gt;, w = (d - bx - cy)/a. Now the partial solution &lt;w x y&gt; is available for the next round, e.g. &lt;au bv cw dx , e&gt;.

* ''reduce'': takes the first equation off the top and pushes it onto the stack; then produces a residual - a reduced matrix, by subtracting the elements of the original, first equation from corresponding elements of the remaining, lower equations, e.g. b[j][k]/b[j][0] - a[k]/a[0]. As you can see, this eliminates the first element in each of the lower equations by subtracting one from one, and only the remaining elements need be kept - ultimately, the residual is an output matrix with one less row, and one less column than the input matrix. It is then used as the input for the next iteration. 

It should be noted that multiplication could also be used in place of division; however, on larger matrices (e.g. n=10), this has a cascading effect producing NAN's (infinities). The division, looked at statistically, has the effect of normalizing the reduced matrices - producing numbers with a mean closer to zero and a smaller standard deviation; for randomly generated data, this produces reduced matrices with entries in the vicinity of +-1.



''Continuation still to be written''

As it is, it shows that it isn't necessary to bring a system into full diagonal form. It is sufficient to bring it into triangular (either upper or lower) form, since it can then be solved by backward or forward substitution respectively.

===SOR Algorithm===
SOR is an abbreviation for the Successive Over Relaxation. It is an iterative scheme that uses a relaxation parameter &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and is a generalization of the Gauss-Seidel method in the special case &lt;math&gt;\omega=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a square system of ''n'' linear equations with unknown '''x''':

:&lt;math&gt;A\mathbf x = \mathbf b&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;A=\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1n} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2n} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{nn} \end{bmatrix}, \qquad  \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{1} \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{bmatrix} , \qquad  \mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} b_{1} \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''A'' can be decomposed into a [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] component ''D'', and [[triangular matrix#Strictly triangular matrix|strictly lower and upper triangular]] components ''L'' and ''U'':

:&lt;math&gt;A=D+L+U, &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;D = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{nn} \end{bmatrix}, \quad L = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ a_{21} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad U = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1n} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2n} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

The system of linear equations may be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;(D+\omega L) \mathbf{x} = \omega \mathbf{b} - [\omega U + (\omega-1) D ] \mathbf{x} &lt;/math&gt;

for a constant ''&amp;omega;'' &gt; 1.

The method of successive over-relaxation is an [[Iterative method|iterative technique]] that solves the left hand side of this expression for '''x''', using previous value for '''x''' on the right hand side. Analytically, this may be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = (D+\omega L)^{-1} \big(\omega \mathbf{b} - [\omega U + (\omega-1) D ] \mathbf{x}^{(k)}\big). &lt;/math&gt;

However, by taking advantage of the triangular form of (''D''+''&amp;omega;L''), the elements of '''x'''&lt;sup&gt;(''k''+1)&lt;/sup&gt; can be computed sequentially using [[forward substitution]]:

:&lt;math&gt; x^{(k+1)}_i  = (1-\omega)x^{(k)}_i + \frac{\omega}{a_{ii}} \left(b_i - \sum_{j&gt;i} a_{ij}x^{(k)}_j - \sum_{j&lt;i} a_{ij}x^{(k+1)}_j \right),\quad i=1,2,\ldots,n. &lt;/math&gt;

The choice of relaxation factor is not necessarily easy, and depends upon the properties of the coefficient matrix.  For [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]], [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] it can be proven that 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;omega;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 will lead to convergence, but we are generally interested in faster convergence rather than just convergence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The exhaust gases (and the bypass air in turbofans) are expanded and accelerated through nozzles, accelerating the flow, by reducing the static pressure of the stream, and provides propulsive force. Convergent nozzles have a progressive reduction in flow area and are used to accelerate flows to subsonic velocities. Convergent-divergent nozzle enable supersonic exit velocities provided a sufficient pressure differential exists. 

The common view is that nozzles provide most of the thrust in practice there is often significant thrust provided by the pressure differentials across other components of the engine such as intakes.  


[[Jet Propulsion/Vectoring|Thrust vectoring]] nozzles direct the exhaust laterally to provide lateral thrust. [[Jet Propulsion/Reversers|Thrust reversers]] redirect the exhaust forwards to provide braking.




==Gas Turbines==

A gas turbine (GT) engine or jet engine is used not only in aircraft but also in various other contrivances power generation, ships and even battle tanks (the US M1A2 Abrams tank uses a 1000 hp gas turbine). In these cases, the nozzle design isn't of much importance because the engine is not used for providing any thrust. In fact, these GT engines are replacements to the usual piston engine because of the high power to weight ratio. Hence the shaft of the GT is coupled to the required contivace, say a generator or a propeller or a gearbox.The exhaust gases from a GT engine in these scenarios get the same treatment that the exhaust gases from the piston engine.

But when the same GT engine is used in an aircraft a nozzle is used because the hot exhaust gases coming out of the GT will have very high pressure which will in turn propel the aircraft forward in accordance to Newton's 3rd Law of motion which states that &quot;EVERY ACTION HAS AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION&quot; .
:Action----&gt; Hot gases at high pressure from nozzle.
:Reaction--&gt; The aircraft being propelled forward.

Nozzles were, until recently, only used for proving thrust but now modified nozzles are being used for changing the course of the aircraft which was traditionally done only using aileron and tail fins.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To create an artwork, you first require supplies and tools. For instance, to create an oil painting, you need something to paint on (often a piece of canvas), something to apply paint (for example, brushes), and oil paint.

==Paper==
[[/ISO_Paper|ISO Paper Standards]] - Getting the right size paper is important. The most common standard is the ISO measurement system. This module details sizes and proportions.

;;Someone please revise this page!
:1) The particle が is used without any explanation whatsoever.
:2) The order in which the sentences are taught does not make any particular sense.
:3) The potentially confusing words 何か and 何も are being used before the student has a chance to absorb the basic structures ～があります and ～がありません.
:[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 21:52, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Good points, but effort should be put into the [[Japanese:New Lesson Thread|new lessons]], which has a much better (progressive) order of learning things. After the new new lessons are complete, the current lessons will probably be archived until it is made sure that there is nothing important in the archived lessons that are not in the new lesson. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 22:04, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

::: I think that the older lessons are in far better shape than the new lessons. The new lessons are well on their way to becoming an impenetrable dictionary. I'm afraid that they'll be a nice reference work but not much of a textbook. I considered reorganizing them, but people seem attached to the &quot;deep&quot; format, so I just fixed the newer lessons up a bit. I've adopted a &quot;wait-and-see&quot; attitude towards the new lessons, until I can see how I can usefully contribute to them without stepping on everyone's toes. - [[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 23:01, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Need Shortcut for Scrolling within a Page ==

I guess my Subject line says it: it would be helpful to be able to scroll up or down within a page or move up or down by the amount of the visible window without taking one's hands off the keyboard to touch the mouse. Right now my kluge is to hit / to open a search within the page, then type a period. By tapping F3 I then advance sentence by sentence. Shift F3 to go back up the page. Another (slower) way is to search for spaces with F3.

I think PageUp and PageDown should be programmed to perform as you might think: make the bottom line of the current window into the top line, or vice versa. Right?

Is there something I don't know about?
thanks

      <text xml:space="preserve">== wave properties/unifying concepts ==

I had left these two &quot;modules&quot; out, since despite having seperate exams, wave properties is covered under electrons and photons as far as the specification is concerned. unifying concepts also has a seperate exam, but according to the specification, it is nothing but material covered in the other modules. I will leave those sections there if you feel that enough original content can be added to them. --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 22:19, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

Wave properties - this is waves, waves, waves.  My recollection of this was that it was almost all done in respect to water surface waves, although I remember reflection and diffraction of light waves, especially Snell's law, critical angle, and application to fibre optics.  And sound, vibration in strings, organ pipes.  The dual nature of light is covered in Electrons and Photons.

Unifying topics I think would cover how the fundamental principles of physics apply throughout the field - conservation of energy; conservation principles in general; approximate correctness of Newtonian physics at everyday scales of speed, mass, and size; relativistic physics for big and fast; quantum mechanics for the very small.

Ideally each of these fundamental principles would be illustrated by at least two examples of application in different contexts.  For instance, how the trajectory of an electron in a television tube has to be calculated relativistically due to the high velocity, yet the rays that it produces on hitting the phosphor screen can be analyzed using classical optics.  This demonstrates how sometimes Newtonian physics is a close enough approximation (watching TV), but not always (designing the TV tube).

Those fundamental principles would, of course, already have been covered in their respective sections. --[[User:Wrolf|Wrolf]] 17:28, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

ok, lets keep them, i dont really have any big problems with that. if they dont develop more than a few lines or so, then we could merge them with some of the other sections.--[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 20:26, 26 August 2005 (UTC)

I'm adding in the Wave Properties section, since as far as I can tell, not everything here ''is'' covered in other sections, and I think that sticking to the format of the specification will make life easier for both readers and writers. --[[User:Justdig|Justdig]] 01:54, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

Hi, and thanks for your contributions to the A-level Physics wikibook.

There seems to be some problem with the changes you made to the front page. I have discussed the issues [[Talk:A-level Physics|here]]. It is not a major problem, but we should avoid repeating information that is covered elsewhere.

Thanks --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 22:26, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Wrolf. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Wrolf~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

== Overview ==

A '''''boggart''''' is a shapeshifter that usually lurks in dark spaces. It has no definite form, taking the shape of that which is most feared by the person who encounters it. When not in the sight of a person, it is believed to look like a dark blob.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

To repel or destroy a boggart, it must be laughed at. The spell [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Riddikulus|''Riddikulus'']] can be cast to force the boggart to assume a generally amusing shape of what the caster mentally conceives.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], the Boggart appears three times.

* In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 7|Defence Against the Dark Arts class]], we are introduced to the Boggart and his characteristics, and the fact that this allows us to see people's deepest fears; this also allows us a comical jab at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] produces a simulacrum of Snape dressed in his grandmother's favorite outfit. Lupin does prevent Harry from triggering the Boggart's defence mechanism, which Harry feels is unfair; but Lupin later explains this as being done to prevent a simulacrum of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] from appearing in front of the class. This in particular shows that Lupin is much more aware of the class and its needs and concerns than any of the other Defence Against the Dark Arts teachers that have preceded him in the series.

* Later, Lupin uses a second Boggart to train Harry in the use of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus charm]] and its use against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]].

* Either this same Boggart, or a third one, is then used in the final exam for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. In this, we see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione's]] insecurity about her grades – her greatest fear is revealed to be &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] – she said I failed everything!&quot; And apparently this is such a great fear that she is unable to invoke Riddikulus against it.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], Harry encounters a Boggart in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|final task]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]]. It takes the form of a Dementor upon seeing Harry.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], a Boggart is discovered in a desk in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|the Headquarters of the Order]]. It is identified by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] using his magical eye, whereupon [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] goes to eliminate it. Ultimately she is unable to, and Remus Lupin, possibly alerted by Mad-Eye Moody, arrives to vanquish it and rescue her.

== Analysis ==

The Boggart has two main purposes in the series: one is to reveal characters' deepest fears, as the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|Mirror Erised]] reveals their deepest desires; the other is to give Harry a &quot;dementor&quot; that he can battle, without risking having his soul sucked out. The latter is the most important, as Harry will be called upon to fight Dementors, and must somehow be prepared for that struggle; but their ability to show the greatest fears of the characters will prove useful as well.

The appearance of the Boggart in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' is particularly interesting, not for the fact of the Boggart, but for the illumination it provides. This episode allows Harry to see what Mrs. Weasley's greatest fears are: that her family, or Harry himself, might end up dead. Naturally, Harry is surprised to see that his well-being is so important to Mrs. Weasley, though he does not comment on it at the time. His thoughts are more about his recent upset at having been passed over for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefectship]], and the realization of just how trivial that was relative to the other possible outcomes for the next few years. The author does not explicitly show us the effect this revelation has on Harry in the long term, but it would be safe to say that Harry is heartened by the discovery that there is someone in the world who cares so much about him.

It is somewhat illuminating to note the form Boggarts take when confronted with specific characters in the story. For [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], a confirmed arachnophobe, it is an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|Acromantula]]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is confronted with the spectre of failing all her courses. Harry, as mentioned, is forced to deal with a Dementor, while Neville faces Professor Snape, and Mrs. Weasley sees, in succession, the death of all her family members and Harry. The Boggart taking the shape of an animated, severed hand for Seamus Finnigan tells us little, but it taking the shape of a full moon when confronted by Lupin would tell us a great deal, if we recognized it as a full moon. It can be interesting to speculate on what other characters would see; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], following the events in the Chamber of Secrets the previous year, might be expected to see herself as a puppet, or to see a puppet master; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], we suspect, would each see the other, dead, though it is uncertain if a Boggart would ever find one of them alone; and it is a safe assumption that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] would see his own lifeless body.

In connection with this, we note the apparent mindlessness of the Boggart's response. Specifically when confronted by Lupin, the Boggart becomes a small, and pointless, simulacrum of the full moon. It does not change even when Lupin casually brushes it aside, indicating an unawareness that its understanding of Lupin's deepest fear is deeply flawed. This indicates that the Boggart's response is automatic, rather than reasoned, and that the lack of a fear response by the target of the Boggart's illusion is not something that the Boggart can react to.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] says &quot;Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone,&quot; yet in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]] is able to identify it immediately, before it is released from the desk. What did Moody see with his magical eye?
#Why does a boggart have the full effect on Harry when it turns into a Dementor but it does not make Lupin a werewolf when it turns into a full moon?
#What parallels can be drawn between the effects of boggarts and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|Mirror of Erised]]?
#Our immediate suspicion is that Voldemort, confronted by a boggart, would see his own corpse. Are there other images that could be presented? Support your answer.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

There is some conflicting information about the effects of Boggarts. In particular, the Boggart-as-Dementor that Harry is using to learn the Patronus charm affects him exactly as the true Dementors do, weakening him and allowing him to hear his mother's and father's final minutes. Yet the boggart-as-full-moon that appears in Lupin's Defence Against the Dark Arts class, and the similar effect occurring when Lupin confronts the Boggart in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', do not cause him to turn into a werewolf.

Uncharacteristically, when Harry encounters the Boggart-as-Dementor in the maze in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', he recognizes it as a Boggart because it trips over its own robes. This is a very uncharacteristic revelation, not something we would expect of a Boggart, and can only be explained by our later understanding that the false Alastor Moody was watching Harry's progress through the maze and eliminating obstacles. Likely he could not eliminate the Boggart, and so made it clumsy to tip Harry off.

==moving &quot;force&quot;==

I think the concept of force should be introduced in [[A-level Physics/Forces and Motion/Dynamics|Dynamics]], because in [[A-level Physics/Forces and Motion/Kinematics|Kinematics]], you are introduced to position, speed, velocity and acceleration without regard to the forces behind the movements, and then in [[A-level Physics/Forces and Motion/Dynamics|Dynamics]], you are introduced to forces of 1N as what accelerates a mass of 1kg at 1m/s^-2.

[[A-level Physics/Forces and Motion/Force, work and power|Force, work and power]] introduces you to the concept of work done  or energy and how power relates to that.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dynamics is the study of why objects move, and the effects of forces on moving objects.

==Mass==

When you are standing on a bus, and the bus starts very quickly, your body seems to be pushed backward, and if the bus stops suddenly, then your body seems to be pushed forwards. Notice that when the bus turns left, you will seem to be pushed to the right, and when the bus turns right, you will seem to be pushed to the left.

Also consider a full shopping cart. If you try to push it from a stationary position, it will take some effort to get it moving. The same is true if you try to stop it when it is moving at a high speed, or try to turn it left or right.

In both cases, an object with '''mass''' is opposing a change in motion. In the first case, it is your body that tries to stay moving as it was before the change. Your body also tries to stay in a straight line when the bus turns, although it appears to be moving to the side. What is really happening is that your body is still moving straight and the bus turns in the opposite direction. The shopping cart exhibits the same behaiviour. When it is stationary, it tries to stay stationary, and when you try to stop it moving, it will try to continue. Your body and the cart both have mass.

From this, we can define a property of mass:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
Mass will resist changes in motion.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This says that any object with mass will resist any change in motion.  Objects with greater mass will resist change in motion more than objects with less mass. It is like having the shopping cart only half full and finding that it is much easier to change its movement.  This is Newton's first law of motion:  An object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an outside force.  Conversely: An object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an outside force.

In the SI system, the unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).

==Force==

We all have an innate understanding of forces. To put quite simply, a force involves a push or a pull. Exerting a force on an object will cause that object to accelerate. 

Try pushing your finger against a wall. By doing this, you are said to exert a '''force''' on the wall. You will feel the wall 'pushing' back on you. The wall is said to exert a '''force''' on you. The force you exert on the wall always equals the force with which the wall exerts on you (Newton's Third Law).* Note that the forces are acting on different bodies. Because the wall is heavy, the force you exert on it does not move the wall noticeably. However, being much lighter, you will be probably be moved by the force that the wall exerts on you. Try it! 

A force can be applied to an object in different directions. Force is said to be a [[Waves/Vectors|vector]] quantity. 

===Force and Acceleration===

Exerting a force on an object causes the object to accelerate. The same force applied on objects of different masses causes different accelerations in each object. We observe that a force applied on a light object causes greater acceleration than the same force applied on a heavier object. We also observe that the acceleration of an object is proportional to the force exerted on it. 

This is summarized by the formula F = kma, where F=force, k=some constant, m=mass and a=acceleration.

===Defining the Newton===

In the SI unit system, force is measured in Newtons. One Newton is the force required to accelerate a mass of 1 kg at &lt;math&gt;1 \rm{m s^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, we have defined the unit of force in such a way that the value of k in F = kma is 1, thereby reducing the equation to F = ma. 

1 N = 100000 dynes = 0.101971621298 kgforce = 0.2248089431 lbforce

1 dyne = 1E-5 Newtons,   1 kgforce=9.80665 Newtons,  and 1 lbforce=4.44822161526 Newtons

===Weight===

The weight of an object is defined as the gravitational force acting on the object, and is dependent on the mass of the body. Note that the acceleration due to gravity (or acceleration of free-fall, usually denoted by g) is taken as the constant &lt;math&gt;9.81 \rm{m s^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt; for all bodies, although it varies slightly from place to place. The direction of that force (weight) is always toward the center of this planet. We can calculate the weight of an object from its mass by the equation W = mg, where W=weight, m=mass and g=acceleration of free fall. In rough terms, an apple weighs approximately one Newton.


*Newton's third law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

==Motion of particles through fluids==

Mechanics of particle motion.

There are three forces acting on particles in motion through a fluid;

1) The external force (gravitational or otherwise);

2) The drag force (apparent when there is relative motion between a particle and a fluid);

3) The buoyant force (acting parallel to the external force, but in the opposite direction).

==Density==
[[Category:A-level Physics|Dynamics]]
&lt;math&gt;Density = \frac {Mass} {Volume}&lt;/math&gt;


== Viscosity ==
Viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to flow. Objects drag fluid along near its surface. The faster the object moves, the bigger the viscous drag.

A traditional Portuguese cod dish, Bacalhau à Zé do Pipo. The Portuguese have a great number of dried/salted codfish recipes, and they are often misunderstood or confused.

==Ingredients==
* 200 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] (7 oz) (1/2 lb) of [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] baked in [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], chopped 5 g [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 400 g (14 oz) (0.9 lb)[[Cookbook:Salting|salted]]/dried [[Cookbook:Cod|cod]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], and [[Cookbook:Pepper|white pepper]]
* 500 g (18 oz) (1.1 lbs) mashed potatoes
** [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] white skin, roasted in oven
** 100 g (3.5 oz) black [[Cookbook:Olive|olives]]
** [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] (optional &quot;Zé do Pipo&quot;)
** [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] (optional)
** [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]] for making the cod sauté (codfisch à Braz)
** [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]

==Procedure==
# Prepare the cod by leaving it for 24 hours in water, changing the water once or twice.
# After the 24 hour period is up, put the cod in a pot with milk. 
# Boil until slightly cooked, add salt and pepper. The milk will make the fish soft.
# Bake and mash the potatoes, optionally adding milk, egg, pepper and lemon juice.
# [[Cookbook:Chop|Chop]] up onions in circles and fry in pan with garlic and lots of olive oil until slightly browned.
# Preheat oven to 220 °C (425 °F).
# Place the cod in the center of a casserole or baking dish. 
# Surround the fish with the mashed potatoes and then cover it with the fried onion. 
# Cover the onion with a thick layer of mayonnaise and sprinkle bread crumbs all over.
# Bake until toasted on top.

Serve with a green wine from the north of Portugal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a game of football, each team is allowed to have a certain number of players, and each team cannot have more than eleven players on the field whenever the ball is in play. The players have different jobs, which are explained in more detail in their respective chapters. In most games, one team(the '''home team''') hosts the game and is said to have '''home field advantage'''. The other team is the '''visiting''' or '''away team'''. The game normally takes place at the home team's stadium, but in special cases, the stadium may be different.

At the beginning of the game, a coin is flipped and the visiting team calls heads or tails while the coin is in the air. Whichever team wins the toss gets to choose whether to choose between kicking and receiving or the choice of which goal to defend, and the loser is stuck with the other choice (which is usually the choice of which goal to defend). The kicking team kicks the ball to the other team, which tries to get as close to the opponent's goal line as possible before being tackled. (Goal lines, end zones, and things like that are explained in the football field chapter.) Once the receiver is tackled, the team in possession of the ball brings out its offense and the opponent brings out its defense.

The offense tries to get to the defense's end zone on each of its drives. On the first play, the situation is described as &quot;'''first and ten''',&quot; which means that it is first down and the offense must gain at least ten yards on the play to get another first down. The yard line that the ball lies on before the center snaps it is called the line of scrimmage, which is adjusted whenever the offense gains or loses yards. The yard line that the offense must cross to gain a first down is designated using a first down marker, which is adjusted whenever a new first down is gained. The number of yards gained or lost on a play is determined by three things:

*1.Running yardage
*2.Passing yardage
*3.Applicable penalties

If the offense is stopped behind the first down marker, the down normally increases by one until fourth down, where the offense may go for a first down, punt, or attempt a field goal. If the offense reaches the defense's end zone, it can kick the ball for an extra point or attempt a two point conversion. After the offense scores, it kicks the ball to the defense, who gains possession of the ball, and the cycle begins again. After each quarter, the teams exchange end zones and the field positions and ball location are adjusted accordingly. At the beginning of the second half, the team who kicked at the beginning of the game receives the ball.

If the fourth quarter ends in a tie, the game goes into '''overtime''', and the way overtime works varies from game to game. In professional football, the first team to break the tie wins the game, while American college football gives the non-scoring team one drive to win or tie the game again. As such, college overtime tends to be longer than NFL overtime.

Note: Although the most popular part of football is still the game itself, cheerleaders have become an important part of the football experience, even at the college level. Some cheerleaders also take part in non-sports-related activities, like calendar shoots.</text>

Hello!
I am sorry to bother you...  I am looking for help for a simple, simple thing, but can't find it around, and I was wondering if you could help me..  
I am opening a business as a behaviour consultant.  I would like to name that business the equivalent of &quot;new behavior&quot; in Latin
I believe the appropriate new would be &quot;novo&quot; but i'll be damn if I can find the correct word for behaviour, let alone conjugate it.  Any chance you can help me out?
Thanks...

      <text xml:space="preserve">In any sport, it's good to know how the seasons work. This chapter describes what happens during a typical football season.

==NFL season==

Each season in the NFL begins with a '''preseason'''. The preseason lasts around four weeks, and most of the teams have to play four games. Some teams play five games during the preseason. These games don't count toward the teams' standings and allow the players to get warmed up.

After the preseason, each team plays a '''regular season'''. Normally, every team plays 16 games and has one bye week, which means that it doesn't play during that week. The '''win-loss-tie record''' is used to compute a team's standing, where a tie is worth half a win. The teams that do the best in their '''divisions''' along with the best two teams among the remaining twelve in each conference(the '''wild card teams''') advance to the '''playoffs'''.

The playoff teams are given seeds based on their performance, where the divisional champions have lower seeds than the wild card teams and the best teams in these groups have the lowest seeds in that group. In each game, the lower seed has home field advantage. The highest seeds play the first round, which is called the '''Wild Card Weekend''', and each wild card team must play against a division champion(#3 against #6, #4 against #5). The four remaining teams compete in a single elimination tournament, and the last team in each conference moves on to the '''Super Bowl'''. The '''Pro Bowl''' is the other postseason bowl game, and the two conferences pick the best players for each position to compete in this game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Compiler ==
A '''[[w:compiler|compiler]]''' is a program that translates a [[w:computer program|computer program]] written in one [[Programming languages bookshelf|computer language]] (the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code#Source code|source code]]) into an equivalent program written in the computer's native [[w:machine language|machine language]]. This process of translation, that includes several distinct steps is called '''compilation'''. Since the compiler is a program, itself written in a computer language, the situation may seem a paradox akin to the [[w:Chicken or the egg|chicken and egg dilemma]]. A compiler may not be created with the resulting compilable language but with a previous available language or even in machine code. 

=== Compilation ===
The '''compilation''' output of a compiler is the result from translating or ''compiling'' a program. The most important part of the output is saved to a file called an '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code|object file]]''''', it consists of the transformation of source files into object files.

{{NOTE|Some files may be created/needed for a successful compilation, that data is not part of the C++ language or may result from the compilation of external code (an example would be a library), this may depend on the specific compiler you use (MS Visual Studio for example adds several extra files to a project), in that case you should check the documentation or it can part of a specific framework that needs to be accessed. Be aware that some of this constructs may limit the portability of the code.}}

The instructions of this ''compiled'' program can then be run (executed) by the computer if the object file is in an executable format. However, there are additional steps that are required for a compilation: preprocessing and linking.

==== Compile-time ====
Defines the time and operations performed by a compiler (i.e., ''compile-time operations'') during a build (creation) of a program (executable or not). Most of the uses of &quot;static&quot; in the C++ language are directly related to compile-time information.

The operations performed at compile time usually include ''lexical analysis'', ''syntax analysis'', various kinds of [[w:Semantic analysis (computer science)|semantic analysis]] (e.g., [[w:datatype|type checks]], some of the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type Casting|type casts]], and [[w:instantiation of template|instantiation of template]]) and [[w:code generation (compiler)|code generation]].

The definition of a programming language will specify compile time requirements that source code must meet to be successfully compiled.

Compile time occurs before [[w:link time|link time]] (when the output of one or more compiled files are joined together) and runtime (when a program is executed).  In some programming languages it may be necessary for some compilation and linking to occur at runtime.

;Run-time
'''Run-time''', or '''execution time''', starts at the moment the program starts to execute and end as it exits. At this stage the compiler is irrelevant and has no control. This is the most important location in regards to optimizations (a program will only compile once but run many times) and debugging (tracing and interaction will only be possible at this stage). But it is also in run-time that some of the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type Casting|type casting may occur]] and that [[C++ Programming/RTTI|Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)]] has relevance. The concept of runtime will be mentioned again when relevant.

===== Lexical analysis =====
This is alternatively known as scanning or ''tokenisation''. It happens before syntax analysis and converts the code into [[Compiler Construction#What is a token|tokens]], which are the parts of the code that the program will actually use. The source code as expressed as characters (arranged on lines) into a sequence of special tokens for each reserved keyword, and tokens for data types and identifiers and values. The lexical analyzer is the part of the compiler which removes whitespace and other non compilable characters from the source code. It uses whitespace to separate different tokens, and ignores the whitespace.

To give a simple illustration of the process:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Depending on the lexical rules used it might be '''tokenized''' as:

&lt;pre&gt;
1 = string &quot;int&quot;
2 = string &quot;main&quot;
3 = opening parenthesis
4 = closing parenthesis
5 = opening brace
6 = string &quot;std&quot;
7 = namespace operator
8 = string &quot;cout&quot;
9 = &lt;&lt; operator
10 = string &quot;&quot;hello world&quot;&quot;
11 = string &quot;endl&quot;
12 = semicolon
13 = string &quot;return&quot;
14 = number 0
15 = closing brace
&lt;/pre&gt;

And so for this program the lexical analyzer might send something like:

&lt;pre&gt;
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 6 7 11 12 13 14 12 15
&lt;/pre&gt;

To the syntactical analyzer, which is talked about next, to be parsed. It is easier for the syntactical analyzer to apply the rules of the language when it can work with numerical values and can distinguish between language syntax (such as the semicolon) and everything else, and knows what data type each thing has.

===== Syntax analysis =====
This step (also called sometimes syntax checking) ensures that the code is valid and will sequence into an executable program. The syntactical analyzer applies rules to the code, checking to make sure that each opening brace has a corresponding closing brace, and that each declaration has a type, and that the type exists, and that.... syntax analysis is more complicated than lexical analysis =). 

As an example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

*The syntax analyzer would first look at the string &quot;int&quot;, check it against defined keywords, and find that it is a type for integers. *The analyzer would then look at the next token as an identifier, and check to make sure that it has used a valid identifier name.
*It would then look at the next token. Because it is an opening parenthesis it will treat &quot;main&quot; as a function, instead of a declaration  of a variable if it found a semicolon or the initialization of an integer variable if it found an equals sign.
*After the opening parenthesis it would find a closing parenthesis, meaning that the function has 0 parameters.
*Then it would look at the next token and see it was an opening brace, so it would think that this was the implementation of the function main, instead of a declaration of main if the next token had been a semicolon, even though you can not declare main in c++. It would probably create a counter also to keep track of the level of the statement blocks to make sure the braces were in pairs. *After that it would look at the next token, and probably not do anything with it, but then it would see the :: operator, and check that &quot;std&quot; was a valid {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}.
*Then it would see the next token &quot;cout&quot; as the name of an identifier in the {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} &quot;std&quot;, and see that it was a template. 
*The analyzer would see the &lt;&lt; operator next, and so would check that the &lt;&lt; operator could be used with cout, and also that the next token could be used with the &lt;&lt; operator.
*The same thing would happen with the next token after the &quot;&quot;hello world&quot;&quot;  token. Then it would get to the &quot;std&quot; token again, look past it to see the :: operator token and check that the {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} existed again, then check to see if &quot;endl&quot; was in the {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}.
*Then it would see the semicolon and so it would see that as the end of the statement.
*Next it would see the keyword {{C++ Programming/kw|return}}, and then expect an integer value as the next token because main returns an integer, and it would find 0, which is an integer.
*Then the next symbol is a semicolon so that is the end of the statement.
*The next token is a closing brace so that is the end of the function. And there are no more tokens, so if the syntax analyzer did not find any errors with the code, it would send the tokens to the compiler so that the program could be converted to machine language. 

This is a simple view of syntax analysis, and real syntax analyzers do not really work this way, but the idea is the same.

Here are some keywords which the syntax analyzer will look for to make sure you are not using any of these as identifier names, or to know what type you are defining your variables as or what function you are using which is included in the C++ language.

==== Compile speed ====
There are several factors that dictate how fast a compilation proceeds, like:

*Hardware
**Resources (Slow CPU, low memory and even a slow HDD can have an influence)

*Software
**The compiler itself, new is always better, but may depend on how portable you want the project to be.
**The design selected for the program (structure of object dependencies, includes) will also factor in.

Experience tells that most likely if you are suffering from slow compile times, the program you are trying to compile is poorly designed, take the time to structure your own code to minimize re-compilation after changes. Large projects will always compile slower. Use pre-compiled headers and external header guards. We will discuss ways to reduce compile time in the [[C++ Programming/Optimization#Compile time|Optimization]] Section of this book.

'''1-2 Chocolate Cake''' is a simple, fairly easy chocolate cake recipe.

== Ingredients ==

*⅓ cup (80 ml) [[cookbook:vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
*2 ounces (55 g) unsweetened [[cookbook:chocolate|chocolate]]
*1 cup [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]] (or ½ cup)
*1 [[cookbook:egg|egg]]
*1¼ cups (300 g) [[cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole wheat flour]]
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]
*¾ cup (180 ml) [[cookbook:water|water]]
*¾ cup (180 g) semi-sweet chocolate pieces (such as chocolate chips)
*½ cup (120 g) chopped [[Cookbook:Nuts and seeds|nut]]s
*(Optional: 4 ounces (115 g) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]] or [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]])

== Procedure ==

#Put the oil and chocolate in an 8 in (20 cm) square pan and set it in 350 °F (180 °C) oven just until the chocolate melts. (Add sour cream or cream cheese if desired.)
#Add remaining ingredients, except chocolate chips and nuts, to the pan.
#Beat with a fork until smooth and creamy (about 2 minutes).
#Scrape the sides of the pan, and spread the batter evenly in the pan.
#Sprinkle with chocolate chips and nuts. Optionally, cut the chocolate chips and nuts into the batter to some extent.
#[[cookbook:Baking|Bake]] at 350 °F (180 °C) for 30 to 40 minutes, until a toothpick stuck in the center comes out clean.
#Cool in pan; eat hot or cooled.

'''Baked Oatmeal''' - excellent as breakfast (perhaps in its less-sweet variation) or a snack.

The first variation presented here tastes to me more like a dessert than a breakfast food (which the second, a modification, aims to be), although is no less delicious for that; try them both and see which you prefer.

== Ingredients ==

*3 [[cookbook:cup|cup]]s (720 g) quick-cooking [[cookbook:oats|oats]]
*1 cup (240 g) [[cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*2 [[cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]]s [[cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1 teaspoon ground [[cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1 teaspoon [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1 cup (240 ml) [[cookbook:milk|milk]]
*1/2 cup (120 g) [[cookbook:butter|butter]] (melted)
*2 [[cookbook:egg|egg]]s

== Procedure ==

Mix the ingredients and pour them into a 9 in (20 cm) pan. (They can be mixed in the pan, but it's a little tricky not to spill.) Bake at 350 °F (175 °C) for 40-45 (probably 45) minutes. Serve hot, cold, and with or without milk - the choice is yours.

== Variations ==

Having tried the above - the original recipe I got from a friend - I found that it didn't fit my &quot;breakfast&quot; paradigm; I modified it to this:

*3 cups (720 g) quick-cooking oats (same as before)
*1/2 cup (120 g) wheat flakes (added)
*1/2 cup (120 g) [[cookbook:Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]] and approximately 1 tablespoon [[cookbook:molasses|molasses]] (substituted for the brown sugar)
*2 teaspoons baking powder (same as before)
*1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (same as before)
*1/2 teaspoon salt (halved)
*1 1/2 cups (360 ml) [[cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] (increased from 1c, changed to soy milk from availability)
*1/2 c (120 ml) [[cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]] (substituted for the butter)
*3 eggs (increased from 2)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Simply put, your eyes see light. That is, the only information your eyes receive about the world in order to construct an image in your head is the [[w:Photon|photons]] that have bounced off of objects near you and into your eyes. So constructing a photo-realistic image is (almost) all about simulating lighting. When there is no light, there are no photons to interact with your eyes, and so obviously, you don't see anything. 

In everyday life, there are light sources all around us to provide light, from lamps in our houses or in the streets, to the sun during the day and the moon (or perhaps just the stars) at night. Every light source has characteristics that we are familiar with; for example, the sun is much brighter than most other light sources we experience, and has light of a particular color (white), and occupies a position in the sky at various parts of the day, and so forth. 

A light source emits photons (and our eyes receive them) at an astronomical rate; the number is so huge that it is difficult to relate it to numbers in our everyday experience. Each photon a light source emits will travel in a straight line forever, until it interacts with some matter (as a matter of fact, the photons that enter your eyes when you look up at the stars at night are the same photons that left the stars millions of years before and have traveled across the universe in that time to enter your eye). When a photon does interact with matter, several things might happen. 

In the simplest case, a photon strikes matter and reflects off. In this case, the photon will typically carry information about the color of the object it struck and continue on in the reflected direction. The specifics of the color can depend on the circumstance. For example, if a white light reflects off a brown table, the photons that reach your eye will carry information about the brown color of the table, not the white light. If a red light reflects off of a white table, it will probably carry some information about the original color of the light and reach your eye a shade of red. 

However, the photon does not always reflect off. What a photon does when it interacts with matter depends on a great many optical properties of the matter. For example, surfaces can have varying degrees of [[w:Mirror|reflectiveness]], [[w:Specularity|specularity]], [[w:Opacity|opacity]], and surface smoothness (amongst others). Photons that strike very reflective surfaces are much more likely to reflect off in a predictable direction (the direction you would expect from looking at a mirror at an angle), but if they strike a non-reflective surface, they're much more likely to scatter in various directions, or simply be absorbed, so that the photon does not continue on any further from the surface. Similarly, a photon that strikes a particularly transparent surface might not bounce off, but instead continue onwards, potentially having been diverted to a slightly different course (this change in original heading is called [[w:Refraction|refraction]], and it is manifested, for example, by the distortion you see when you stick a pen into a glass of water). 

You might look at the room you are sitting in, with all its finely detailed surfaces, and many intricate objects, and numerous light sources, and imagine all of the photons zipping around the room, bouncing off of objects, through objects, or getting absorbed, or perhaps bouncing off of objects numerous times, all before finally reaching your eyes. The final picture your brain processes is constructed from a huge number of photons, all of which have taken a potentially complex path in their journey from the light source to your eyes. 

The problem becomes apparent. We cannot hope to ever, even with futuristic computers many years hence, hope to model all of these light interactions as individual photons leaving light sources and zipping around the scene before heading into our virtual camera lens. Instead, we must find more computationally tractable ways of approximating the situation we've described above. The most obvious technique for doing this is called raytracing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Who is Erno Rubik? ===
Erno Rubik is the inventor of the Rubik's cube and several other puzzles. The Rubik's cube is a permutation puzzle, just like many other puzzles in the Rubik brand.

=== What is a permutation puzzle? ===
A permutation puzzle is a type of puzzle in which parts are moved around the puzzle in a limited number of ways. Depending on the number of parts and the restrictions on movement, the puzzle has a number of possible ''configurations'', or ''positions''. The higher the number of possible positions, the more difficult it will be to solve the puzzle, in general.

One of the oldest and best-known permutation puzzles is the Towers of Hanoi, which consists of three sticks and seven tiles on one of the sticks, stacked in descending size. The second and third stick are left empty. It is the goal of the game to put all tiles on the third stick, moving one tile at a time, where a bigger tile can never be on top of a smaller tile.  This takes 127 moves.

The Rubik's Cube has an astonishing number of 43 quintillion possible positions, one of which is the solved case.

== Types of Rubik Puzzle ==

=== Cubes ===

* 2x2x2 (mini/pocket/junior/ice)
* 3x3x3 (regular)
* 4x4x4 (revenge/master)
* 5x5x5 (professor)

=== Snake ===

=== Magic ===

=== Clock ===

* 2x2x2 (mini)
* [[How to Solve the Rubik's Cube|3x3x3 (regular)]]
* 4x4x4 (revenge)
* 5x5x5 (professor)

=== Clock ===

== Speedsolving ==
By speedsolving is meant solving a scrambled cube in the fastest possible time (bringing it back to its initial, solved position).

More on this topic can be found at the [[http://www.speedcubing.com speedcubing]] website.

== Tuning ==
Tuning is the art of using tools and techniques to adjust the puzzle itself for the purpose of speedsolving. A puzzle can generally be tuned by
* lubricating (lubing), often with silicon spray(not oil-based)
* sanding
* adjusting: some puzzles have adjustable screws
* rebuilding: replacing original parts with (hopefully) better ones
and finally a common practice is restickering, which of course doesn't do much for the speed.

Read more on [[http://www.speedcubing.com/ton Ton's pages]]

== Creating puzzles ==
It's possible to create your own permutation puzzle. You could make a computer simulation of a known puzzle or invent a new computer permutation puzzle. Or you could create a real life puzzle. Most are made from plastic, and are hard to fabricate without specialized tools. It is noteworthy that the first Rubik's cube was actually made of wood!
Many other puzzles were influenced by Erno Rubik's puzzles. Later, more puzzles were created1(6x6x6-11x11x11, 17x17x17, pyraminx, megaminx, gigaminx, teraminx, petaminx, examinx, square-1 cube, square-2 cube, super square-1 cube, flower cube, 3x3x5, and much more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As we saw in the previous chapter, it is impossible, practically speaking, to model the photons coming from light sources directly. There are simply too many photons necessary to generate all of the visual information we see, and most of the photons that leave a given light source probably do not even reach our eyes. When you add in the complexities of multiple light sources necessary to create a scene true to our experience, tracing each individual photon from the light source until it (potentially) reaches our virtual camera is simply not possible. 

The approach we use instead is called [[w:Raytracing|raytracing]]. Raytracing is actually very simple conceptually, and makes our problem tractable. Here is the basic idea. 

Our digital image is made up of a finite number of pixels. Since the pixels are the atomic element of the image, we are only concerned with what color each pixel should be. The idea of raytracing is to work backwards from the pixels of our virtual camera, going through each individual pixel and tracing an imaginary &quot;ray&quot; straight away from that pixel until we encounter an object (specifically, a particular point on that object). 

Once we find the intersection point in space that the ray hit, we reason that the light that would have hit this pixel contains all of the information about the light that was striking the object at this point, plus the interaction with that object. Thus, we can start a new ray on this location of the object, and trace it backwards until we hit another object, and so on. Eventually, the ray must strike a light source. Once we have found this light source, we then know the color of the light that left this light source, and struck one object, bounced off, struck another, and so on all the way back to our camera's pixel. Thus, we now know what color to put in that pixel.

This is just the grammatical form of Neapolitan's greetings. Because, for their civilty, Neapolitans are very friendly when they greet, so you will have a very long greet, for example:

&quot;''Uè Gennà, comme staje, 'a quantu tiempo ca nun ce sentimmo, tutto 'a posto, â casa tutt'a posto, mugliereta, mammeta, figlieta? Jammece 'a piglià nu cafè, però pav'io, nun mettere 'a mana ô portafoglio! Mamma e comme te sî fatto bello, ecc....''&quot; The greet can also last longer, because, as explained earlier, Neapolitans are very friendly people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why do Focus Warmups?==
When performing or rehearsing it is vital to make sure that the actors are concentrated on the task. There are many exercises designed to help teamwork and concentration.

==Twenty One==
'''Notes''' &lt;br&gt;
Playing ''21'' is easy. However, a minimum of 2 people (however, more than this is highly suggested) is required to play. The ideal size for a group to play ''21'' depends on ability of participants however somewhere between 5 and 20 is a good size to play this game. 

'''How To Play''' &lt;br&gt;
All participants stand in random distribution in the warmup space. Participants close their eyes. Then, randomly, someone must say the number 1. Another person must then say the number 2, and so forth until the number 21. However, should any two participants say a number at the same time, the group must start again at 1. Participants may not form an order in which to say numbers.

'''Extension''' &lt;br&gt;
When the number 21 has been reached, try timing the group to get faster and faster at reaching 21.

==The Impulse Walk==
'''How To Play'''
All participants are to stand in a line with eyes closed. On impulse, they are to begin to walk, and as they do so, they can open their eyes. The aim of the game is to settle on a group &quot;energy&quot; which provokes a spontaneous impulse in all participants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">SI units are used throughout science in many countries of the world. There are seven '''base units''', from which all other units are derived.

==Base units==

Every other unit is either a combination of two or more base units, or a reciprocal of a base unit. With the exception of the kilogram, all of the base units are defined as measurable natural phenomena. Also, notice that the kilogram is the only base unit with a [[A-level_Physics/The_SI_System_of_Units#Prefixes|prefix]]. This is because the gram is too small for most practical applications.

==Derived units==

Most of the derived units are the base units divided or multiplied together. Some of them have special names. You can see how each unit relates to any other unit, and knowing the base units for a particular derived unit is useful when checking if your working is correct.

Note that &quot;m/s&quot;, &quot;m&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;, &quot;m&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{s}}&lt;/math&gt; are all equivalent. The negative exponent form is generally preferred, for example &quot;kg&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; is unambiguous. In contrast &quot;kg/m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; is ambiguous -

is it &lt;math&gt;\frac{(\frac {kg}{m})}{s^2}&lt;/math&gt;  &amp;nbsp;or is it&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\frac{kg}{(\frac{m}{s^2})}&lt;/math&gt;?

Symbols usually start with a lower case letter unless the unit was named after somebody - for example &quot;newtons&quot; (note lower case letter when writing in English about the units) were named after Sir Isaac Newton, &quot;watts&quot; after James Watt, &quot;farads&quot; after Michael Faraday and so on.

==Prefixes==

The SI units can have prefixes to make larger or smaller numbers more manageable. For example, visible light has a wavelength of roughly 0.0000005&amp;nbsp;m, but it is more commonly written as 500&amp;nbsp;nm. If you must specify a quantity like this in metres, you should write it in standard form. As given by the table below, 1&amp;nbsp;nm = 1×10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m. In standard form, the first number must be between 1 and 10. So to put 500&amp;nbsp;nm in standard form, you would divide the 500 by 100 to get 5, then multiply the factor by 100 (so that it's still the same number), getting 5×10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m. The power of 10 in this answer, i.e.,. -7, is called the exponent, or the order of magnitude of the quantity.

==Homogenous equations==

Equations must always have the same units on both sides, and if they don't, you have probably made a mistake. Once you have your answer, you can check that the units are correct by doing the equation again with only the units. 

===Example 1===

For example, to find the velocity of a cyclist who moved 100 metres in 20 seconds, you have to use the formula 
:&lt;math&gt;velocity = \frac {displacement}{time}&lt;/math&gt; 
so your answer would be 100÷20 = 5&amp;nbsp;m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

This question has the units m&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;s and should give an answer in m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Here, the equation was correct, and makes sense. In this case a middle-dot (·) has been inserted between the &quot;m&quot; and the &quot;s&quot; to show that this is metres per second, not milliseconds.

Often, however, it isn't that simple. If a car of mass 500&amp;nbsp;kg had an acceleration of 0.2&amp;nbsp;m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, you could use Newton's second law
:&lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt; 
to show that the force provided by the engines is 100&amp;nbsp;N. At first glance it would seem the equation is not homogeneous, since the equation uses the units (kg)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;), which should give an answer in kg·m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. If you look at the [[A-level_Physics/The_SI_System_of_Units#Derived_units|derived units table]] above, you can see that a newton is in fact equal to kg·m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore the equation is correct.

===Example 2===

Using the same example as above, imagine that we are only given the mass of the car and the force exerted by the engine, and have been asked to find the acceleration of the car. Using 
:&lt;math&gt;F=ma&lt;/math&gt; 
again, we need to rearrange it for ''a''. We do this '''&lt;u&gt;incorrectly&lt;/u&gt;''' by setting
:&lt;math&gt;a=\frac {m}{F}&lt;/math&gt;. 
By inserting the numbers, we get the answer a&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. We already know that this is wrong from the example above, but by looking at the units, we can see why this is the case 
:&lt;math&gt;ms^{-2}\ne\frac {kg}{kg\ ms^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The units are m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, when we were looking for m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. The problem is the fact that &quot;F=ma&quot; was rearranged incorrectly. The correct formula was 
:&lt;math&gt;a=\frac {F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, 
and using it will give the correct answer of 0.2&amp;nbsp;m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. The units for the correct formula are 
:&lt;math&gt;ms^{-2}=\frac {kg\ ms^{-2}}{kg}=ms^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

I agree, but the example in the module isn't abusing exceptions as a GOTO statement :-)
[[User:Thunderbolt16|Thunderbolt16]] 19:47, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

Another vote for not using exceptions as GOTO statements. They are called exceptions for a reason. You should use if statements and check them correctly instead of arbitrarily running stuff. I haven't looked at how exceptions are actually handled in the python code but they are probably expensive as in other languages. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:71.4.57.161|71.4.57.161]] ([[User talk:71.4.57.161|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/71.4.57.161|contribs]]) 23:37, 23 June 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Maybe someone could offer wisdom on how much to use exceptions in Python? In C++/Java they are generally used &quot;in exceptional circumstances&quot; and are quite expensive. Does their design in Python lead to more generous use such as filtering inputs in functions rather than returning a default or known error value?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:86.136.239.234|86.136.239.234]] ([[User talk:86.136.239.234|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/86.136.239.234|contribs]]) 16:48, 8 October 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why not use the Time value of money page from wikipedia? Any thoughts? It is very thorough. 
Added to the first paragraph because there is more to the time value of money than inflation. [[User:Robbimj|Robbimj]] 03:54, 25 November 2006 (UTC)


&quot;Just what is finance?  The ins and outs of it can be debated, scrutinized, revised, and trivialized ad nauseum.&quot;

Removed, because this is obvious. It does nothing to elaborate.


&quot;But at its heart, finance is nothing more than the activity of matching those who have money to those who need or want it without having to earn it first.&quot;

This is pratical application of finance. The phrase &quot;nothing more&quot; is odd.


&quot;The means are inumerable but all to the same end: personal gain by granting the use of one's money to another.&quot;

This is wrong. Governments, non-profits, NGOs engage in financial sphere activity as well. Not all financial activities result in personal gain.


&quot;It is not actually requisite that money be the medium of finance.  Laws very commonly permit the contribution of anything having some value as business investment, be it equipment, property, service, and so on.&quot;

Money is BY DEFINITION a medium of exchange. Investments and finance are related, but are not the same.


&quot;The Time Value of Money is one of three fundamental ideas that shape finance.  The primary problem behind the Time Value of Money is that of inflation.  When asked would you rather have $10 today or $10 next year, people would prefer to receive $10 right now instead of receiving $10 in the future, simply because the buying power that $10 affords a person today will be diminished by rising prices next year.&quot;

This is nonsensical. The idea of Time Value of Money has been around during the time Gold was used as currency, when inflation was much less of an issue. The Time Value of Money has to do with the rate of real return. Inflation is one aspect needed to be considered, but it is not the reason for the developement of the theory. The first sentence is correct. The rest is close to junk. ie; does Time Value of Money not work during the Great Depression? Have they forgotten it in Japan?


&quot;Fundamental to all economic activity is rationality and self interest.  People who are acting rationally act out of self-interest.  The difficulty in finance is that there is no apparent connection between simply allowing another person access to your money and anything that will benefit you personally for doing so.&quot;

The last line makes no sense just from reading it. A fundemental ASSUMPTION of some theories of economics is the rational individual; but this is a heavily debated topic within the field of economics.


&quot;Third is the idea of risk.  If one gives up control of one's money to another, there exists the possibility that one will never see it again.  In addition there is also the possibility that in attempt to serve another person, if that person is injured or somehow feels misled, one may find himself the target of a lawsuit.&quot;

This is NOT the most common risk. Even if one &quot;keeps&quot; the money, there exists a chance of loss. The lawsuit risks are not peculiar to finance and has nothing to do with finance per se. We arent talking about financial fraud or negligence here. Risk is MUCH broader and more complex than this.


&quot;What motive, then, does one have not to spend all of one's money as soon as he receives it?  The main motive is to increase one's future buying power beyond what one's own capabilities permit.&quot;

This is accurate, but only for PERSONAL finance. Also - what does &quot;one's own capabilities&quot; mean? If one can buy stock and the stock appreciates - does that not constitute &quot;capability&quot;? If not, then does this mean that since I do not know how to farm I am incapable of feeding myself?


&quot;every financing activity for every venture falls into the category of either '''debt financing''' or '''equity financing'''.&quot;

This is true of modern financial practice. The words &quot;every&quot; is FAR too general - the reference to large business is mistaken (small businesses use it as well as governments, individuals and non-profits).


&quot;Each category has slightly different balance of characteristics.&quot;

This does nothing to explain WHAT those differences are. Differences between debt financing, and even within debt financing, is a huge field of study.


&quot;Higher return, of course, is a direct result of higher risk.&quot;

This is financial theory. The concept of risk vs. return needs to be explored further if you're going to make a statement like this.


Debt financing is the more strightforward of the two categories.  In this mode money is borrowed for a business venture.  The transaction has one borrower or '''debtor''', and at least one lender or '''creditor'''.  Forms of debt financing can include credit cards, mortgages, signature loans, bonds, IOUs, and HELOCs (Home Equity Lines of Credit) as examples.

The word &quot;straightforward&quot; implies a level of clarity on this issue that isnt there. There are many forms of debt financing. As for &quot;business venture,&quot; governments are one of the major consumers of credit. 


&quot;With debt financing, the creditor's return is fixed and understandable. &quot;

If by understandable you mean easier to predict than equity, I would agree. But the &quot;real&quot; return is potentially very mystifying. Dont know what to replace it with, but this isnt the best.


&quot;Equity financing is where the far greater risk lies with the far greater return.  The sky is the limit with both.&quot;

Maybe, before the advent of the Joint Stock Corporation. But - since that financial innovation (a topic that MUST be discussed in this &quot;book&quot;) the risks have been limited to investments made. Personal liability was stripped out. Also - the &quot;sky&quot; is a very real place, the limit is, at it's extreme, the production possiblities frontier of the economy. This is what prevents housing bubbles (most recently) or internet stock bubbles (just a few years ago) from becoming the only things in the economy; real, physical reality tends to intervene.


&quot;The return of equity financing is the claim on a business's ''profits''.  As long as the business is profitable your investment will provide a return indefinitely.&quot;

It's not just &quot;profits&quot; - it's ALL FUTURE POTENTIAL PROFITS that gives companies much of their value. This is why the &quot;time value of money&quot; concept is so important. A stock can be seen as all future potential profits of a company compressed into today and expressed in a price at a given exchange at a given time. 


&quot;Only the equity investor may decide when to withdraw his investment and thus relinquish his claim.&quot;

Take a look at revolutionary Russia, or Jews in Germany, or the too common notion of bankruptcy. This is decidedly NOT true.


&quot;i.e. because most personal finance does not involve the debtor making a profit,&quot;

This ISNT true. People leverage themselves all the time to make profit. It happens everyday (and happend quite a bit recently) when people borrowed money to buy home. They involved debt to try to make a profit.


&quot;Creditors can sit back and expect their investment to come back to them or else go a get it back.  But they can do nothing to push the business in any direction.  They can only wait.&quot;

This ISNT true. Creditors can sell default risk to others, manage it in some other ways like CDO and MBS. They can always stop lending them money, not rolling over the debt, etc.

&quot;(subject to legal and ethical restrictions, of course).&quot;

This isnt an article on financial ethics or financial law. It's about FINANCE.

Wow - '''this &quot;book&quot; needs a TON of work.'''

:: This book does need a lot of work. Slowly, but surely with everyone's help we can get this book off the ground. Also as with a regular wiki article, I think references should be made so that we don't run into some the problems highlighted above. --[[User:Glinos|Glinos]] ([[User talk:Glinos|talk]]) 16:44, 17 December 2009 (UTC)


So who created this page?&lt;br&gt;
What ideas do we want to put across?&lt;br&gt;
Obviously Wikipedia has quite a good page already.
Can we expand this without duplicating?&lt;br&gt;
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance Finance on Wikipedia]
::The purposes and aims of wikipedia and wikibooks are not the same. Wikipedia is meant to be an overview of verifiable facts, but not exhaustive nor a teaching aid like a textbook. This is where this book needs to pickup. It should be a textbook that teaches these concepts in a some kind of logical order instead a just a web of ideas thrown about. --[[User:Glinos|Glinos]] ([[User talk:Glinos|talk]]) 16:44, 17 December 2009 (UTC)

== Do we want to create a book or not? ==

This is as hell sure does not seem like a book, so who all would like to go in for a rewrite on this.

We need the following:

***** A name for the book - Yes, should it be Introduction to Finance? - this is PRIORITY
1) Table of Contents - to be updated as the book progresses.
2) A chapter by chapter progression
3) Where do we stop at - Finance is highly specialized, so we need to know where we stop. If we do provide an introduction to finance, we can cover the basic steps. 


 Who all are interested in developing this???

--Venky 06:42, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

== Changes made ==

I have added a To Do and a Contributors page. Kindly put in your additions to both the pages.

--Venky 06:46, 2 February 2007 (UTC)


One year later, I just re-wrote the Inroduction to the Time-Value of money and wrote also about the Discount Rate. --[[User:Alpapad|Alpapad]] ([[User talk:Alpapad|talk]]) 02:24, 13 February 2008 (UTC)

== Book name changed to Principles of Finance ==

Dear all,
I have changed the title of the book to Principles of Finance. 

--Venky 07:06, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

== Examples ==
If any one continues to work on it I think that the big difference between this and wikipedia articles on the same subject is lots more examples should be included.

:: I agree, this shouldn't just be a smattering of facts. The intent of this book is to teach. If examples help teach the material better, then examples will be needed. --[[User:Glinos|Glinos]] ([[User talk:Glinos|talk]]) 16:32, 17 December 2009 (UTC)

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Cuisine of the United Kingdom]]

There is no small amount of disagreement about what constitutes [[w:Welsh Rarebit|Welsh Rarebit]]. Many contend that it is just cheese on toast. At the other end of the spectrum are a variety of recipes in which the bread is steeped in beer or floated in soup. 

It has been said that &quot;Welsh rarebit&quot; is a sort of post Act of Union joke, where Irish Rabbit is just bread, Welsh Rabbit is bread and cheese, Scottish Rabbit is bread and dripping and English Rabbit is actually rabbit. This, however, is a moderately uncontroversial recipe for Welsh Rarebit.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
* 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 
* 1/2 teaspoon salt 
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
* 2 fl. oz. (60ml) beer such as porter (Guinness will do)
* 4 fl. oz. (120ml) double cream 
* 6 oz. (170g) grated Cheddar 
* 4 slices of toast

== Procedure ==
# In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the butter and whisk in the flour. 
# Cook, whisking constantly for 2 to 3 minutes, being careful not to brown the flour. 
# Whisk in mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper until smooth. 
# Add beer and whisk to combine. 
# Pour in cream and whisk until well combined and smooth. 
# Gradually add cheese, stirring constantly, until cheese melts and sauce is smooth; this will take 4 to 5 minutes. 
# Pour over toast and serve immediately.

===Work up of suspected pulmonary embolism===
Initial work up depends on the level of clinical suspicion  
* LOW
::    Check D-dimer.  if D-dimer is negative, no additional work up is indicted. Otherwise, perform a CT angiography with or without CT venography
* INTERMEDIATE
::    CT angiography with or without CT venography
* HIGH
**   If inpatient, abnormal chesr x-ray findings, patient is older than 40 years, or patient has COPD, perform a CT angiography with or without CT venography
**   Otherwise, perform VQ scan
***        Normal VQ-scan: no additional work up is indicted
***        If VQ-scan is low-intermediate probability: CT angiography with or without CT venography
***        if VQ-scan has a high probability, a diagnosis of PE could be made

If CT angiography is positive, a diagnosis of PE could be made and treatment should be considered.

if CT angiography is negative, but there is high clinical suspicion or limited cardiopulmunary reserve, perform angiography. Otherwise, no additional work up is indicted.

== Truth functions ==

A formula with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;var&gt; sentence letters requires &lt;math&gt;2^n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; lines in its truth table.  And there are &lt;math&gt;2^m\,\!&lt;/math&gt; possible truth functions having a truth table of &lt;var&gt;m&lt;var&gt; lines.  Thus there are &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; possible truth functions of &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; sentence letters.  There are 4 possible truth functions of one sentence letter (requiring a 2 line truth table) and 16 possible truth functions of two sentence letters (requiring a 4 line truth table).  We illustrate this with the following tables.  The numbered columns represent the different possibilities for the column of a main connective.

You will recognize column (iii) as the negation truth function.

Column (ii) represents the truth function for disjunction, column (v) represents conditional, column (vii) represents biconditional, and column (viii) represents conjunction.

== Expressing arbitrary truth functions ==

The question arises whether we have enough connectives to represent all the truth functions of any number of sentence letters.  Remember that each row represents one valuation.  We can express that valuation by conjoining sentence letters assigned True under that valuation and negations of sentence letters assigned false under that valuation.  The four valuations of the second table above can be expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can express an arbitrary truth function by disjoining the vaulations under which the truth function has the value true.  For example, we can express column (x) with:

: (1) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

You can confirm by completing the truth table that this produces the desired result.  The formula is true when either (a) &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is false or (b) &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is false and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true.  There is an easier way to express this same truth function:  &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Coming up with a ''simple'' way to express an arbitrary truth function may require insight, but at least we have an automatic mechanism for finding ''some'' way to express it.

Now consider a second example.  We want to express a truth function of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and we want this to be true under (and only under) the following three valuations.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; 
| align=&quot;center | &amp;nbsp;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center | (i)
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center | (ii)
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; || align=&quot;center | (iii)
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| &amp;nbsp; || True 
| &amp;nbsp; || False 
| &amp;nbsp; || False
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| &amp;nbsp; || True 
| &amp;nbsp; || True 
| &amp;nbsp; || False
|-
| &amp;nbsp; || &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| &amp;nbsp; || False 
| &amp;nbsp; || False 
| &amp;nbsp; || True
|}


We can express the three conditions which yield true as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \land \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \land \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Now we need to say that ''either'' the first condition holds ''or'' that the second condition holds ''or'' that the third condition holds:

: (2) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \land \lnot \mathrm{R}) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \land \lnot \mathrm{R}) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

You can verify by a truth table that it yields the desired result, that the formula is true in just the interpretation above.

This technique for expressing arbitrary truth functions does not work for truth functions evaluating to False in every interpretation.  We need at least one interpretation yielding True in order to get the formula started.  However, we can use any tautologically false formula to express such truth functions.  &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; will suffice.

== Normal forms ==

A ''normal form'' provides a standardized rule of expression where any formula is equivalent to one which conforms to the rule.  It will be useful in the following to define a ''literal'' as a sentence letter or its negation.  

The technique for expressing arbitrary truth functions used formulae in disjunctive normal form.  A formula in ''disjunctive normal form'' is a disjunction of conjunctions of literals.  For the purposes of this definition, we countenance many-place disjunctions and conjunctions such as &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \land \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q} \lor \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Also for the purpose of this definition we countenance degenerate disjunctions and conjunctions of only one disjunct or conjunct.  Thus we count &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as being in disjunctive normal form.  It is a degenerate (one-place) disjunction of a degenerate (one-place) conjunction.  We could make it less degenerate (but more debauched) by converting it to the equivalent formula &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{P}) \lor (\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

There is another common normal form in sentential logic, conjunctive normal form.  ''Conjunctive normal form'' is a conjunction of a disjunctions of literals.  We can express arbitrary truth functions in conjunctive normal form.  First, take the valuations for which the truth function evaluates to False.  For each such valuation, form a disjunction of sentence letters the valuation assigns False together with the negations of sentence letters the valuation assign true.  For the valuation

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''':''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; False
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''':''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; True
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''':''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; False

we form the disjunction

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q} \lor \lnot \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The conjunctive normal form expression of an arbitrary truth function is the conjunction of all such disjunctions matching the interpretations for which the truth function evaluates to false.  The conjunctive normal form equivalent of (1) above is

: &lt;math&gt;(\lnot \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{P} \lor \lnot \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The conjunctive normal form equivalent of (2) above is

: &lt;math&gt;(\lnot \mathrm{P} \lor \lnot \mathrm{Q} \lor \lnot \mathrm{R}) \land 
(\mathrm{P} \lor \lnot \mathrm{Q} \lor \lnot \mathrm{R}) \land 
(\mathrm{P} \lor \lnot \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}) \land 
(\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q} \lor \lnot \mathrm{R}) \land 
(\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})&lt;/math&gt;

== Interdefinability of connectives ==

Negation and conjunction are sufficient to express the other three connectives and indeed any arbitrary truth function.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q}) \land \lnot (\mathrm{Q} \land \lnot \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Negation and disjunction are sufficient to express the other three connectives and indeed any arbitrary truth function.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\lnot \mathrm{P} \lor \lnot \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\lnot \mathrm{P} \lor \lnot \mathrm{Q}) \lor \lnot (\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Negation and conditional are sufficient to express the other three connectives and indeed any arbitrary truth function.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \lnot \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot ((\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \lnot (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Negation and biconditional are not sufficient to express the other three connectives.

== Joint and alternative denials ==

We have seen that three pairs of connectives are each jointly sufficient to express any arbitrary truth function.  The question arises, is it possible to express any arbitrary truth function with just one connective?  The answer is yes, but not with any of our connectives.  There are two possible binary connectives each of which, if added to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, would be suffient.

=== Alternative denial ===

''Alternative denial'', sometimes called ''NAND''.  The usual symbol for this is called the ''Sheffer stroke''.  Temporarily add the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mid\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}[(\varphi \mid \psi)]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be True when at least one of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is false.  It has the truth table :

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black; border-right:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
|align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \mid \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|}
|}

We now have the following equivalences.

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \mid \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \mid \mathrm{Q}) \mid (\mathrm{P} \mid \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \mid \mathrm{P}) \mid (\mathrm{Q} \mid \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \mid (\mathrm{Q} \mid \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \mid \mathrm{Q}) \mid ((\mathrm{P} \mid \mathrm{P}) \mid (\mathrm{Q} \mid \mathrm{Q}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Joint denial ===

''Joint denial'', sometimes called ''NOR''.  Temporarily add the symbol &lt;math&gt;\downarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}[(\varphi \downarrow \psi)]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be True when both &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are false.  It has the truth table :

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black; border-right:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
|align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \downarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|}
|}

We now have the following equivalences.

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \downarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For a simple oscillator consisting of a mass &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; to one end of a spring with a spring constant &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;, the restoring force, &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;, can be expressed by the equation&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Force = Spring constant x displacement\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

The general solution for this type of 'simple harmonic motion' is x=Asin(wt+phi). 
Here, phi(the angle expressed in radians) is known as the phase of the simple harmonic motion.</text>

== The Position Equation ==

This section shows how to form the equation describing the position of a mass on a spring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For a simple oscillator consisting of a mass &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; attached to one end of a spring with a spring constant &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;, the restoring force, &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;, can be expressed by the equation
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f = -sx\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is the displacement of the mass from its rest position. Substituting the expression for &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; into the linear momentum equation,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f = ma = m{d^2x \over dt^2}\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; is the acceleration of the mass, we can get
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;m\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2 }= -sx &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
or,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} + \frac{s}{m}x = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note that the frequency of oscillation &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; is given by
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega_0^2 = {s \over m}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
To solve the equation, we can assume
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x(t)=A e^{\lambda t} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The force equation then becomes
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(\lambda^2+\omega_0^2)A e^{\lambda t} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Giving the equation
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda^2+\omega_0^2 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Solving for &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \pm j\omega_0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This gives the equation of &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; to be
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x = C_1e^{j\omega_0 t}+C_2e^{-j\omega_0 t}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Note that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;j = (-1)^{1/2}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and that &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; are constants given by the initial conditions of the system

If the position of the mass at &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 0 is denoted as &lt;i&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, then
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_1 + C_2 = x_0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
and if the velocity of the mass at &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 0 is denoted as &lt;i&gt;u&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, then
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-j(u_0/\omega_0) = C_1 - C_2\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Solving the two boundary condition equations gives
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_1 = \frac{1}{2}( x_0 - j( u_0 / \omega_0 ))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_2 = \frac{1}{2}( x_0 + j( u_0 / \omega_0 ))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
The position is then given by
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x_0 cos(\omega_0 t) + (u_0 /\omega_0 )sin(\omega_0 t)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
This equation can also be found by assuming that &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is of the form
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x(t)=A_1 cos(\omega_0 t) + A_2 sin(\omega_0 t)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
And by applying the same initial conditions,
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;A_1 = x_0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;A_2 = \frac{u_0}{\omega_0}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
This gives rise to the same position equation
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x(t) = x_0 cos(\omega_0 t) + (u_0 /\omega_0 )sin(\omega_0 t)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

== Alternate Position Equation Forms ==
If &lt;i&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; are of the form
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;A_1 = A cos( \phi)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;A_2 = A sin( \phi)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Then the position equation can be written
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;math&gt;x(t) = Acos( \omega_0 t - \phi )\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
By applying the initial conditions (&lt;i&gt;x(0)=x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, u(0)=u&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) it is found that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x_0 = A cos(\phi)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{u_0}{\omega_0} = A sin(\phi)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
If these two equations are squared and summed, then it is found that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;math&gt;A = \sqrt{x_0^2 + (\frac{u_0}{\omega_0})^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
And if the difference of the same two equations is found, the result is that
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;math&gt;\phi = tan^{-1}(\frac{u_0}{x_0 \omega_0})\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

The position equation can also be written as the Real part of the imaginary position equation
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Re} [x(t)] = x(t) = A cos(\omega_0 t - \phi)\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Due to euler's rule (e&lt;sup&gt;j&amp;phi;&lt;/sup&gt; = cos&amp;phi; + jsin&amp;phi;), &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;(t) is of the form
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x(t) = A e^{j(\omega_0 t - \phi)}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a glossary explaining the jargon used in football.

*away team
See &quot;visiting team.&quot;

*blitz

A blitz is a play where the defense brings up players away from the line of scrimmage in order to attack the quarterback. The idea behind blitzing is to force a bad pass or get a sack, where the quarterback is tackled before he lets go of the ball.

*challenge

In some versions of football, including NFL football, a coach or an official from the booth can challenge the referee's call on the field, which is traditionally designated by the throwing of a red flag. During the challenge, the referee watches the replay for two minutes and either lets the call stand or overturns it. If a coach issues a challenge and the call stands, that coach's team loses a timeout, if one remains. A team gets a 15-yard penalty if its coach issues a challenge in the last two minutes of a half. A team can only call two challenges during one half. Although the referee's decision is up to him, he needs clear visual evidence to overturn a call. Nonetheless, the referee's call can make him seem biased, and he can lose credibility.

*conference
A conference is a set of teams in the same league. In the NFL, there are two conferences:the American Football Conference(AFC) and the National Football Conference(NFC). In the NCAA, there are many more.

*cornerback (CB)

Cornerbacks tend to start near the line of scrimmage and guard against passes to particular receivers, even though they can blitz the quarterback on particular plays.

*defense

The meaning of defense is not clear cut. Some people may define it as the team that does not have possession of the ball, and others may define it as the team that does not start the play with possession of the ball. Still others may define it as the team with defensive players on the field. The first syllable is accented.

*defensive back (DB)

A defensive back is a player whose main job is to block the pass. They tend to be smaller and faster than linebackers, and they are separated into cornerbacks and safeties.

*defensive line

The defensive line normally consists of the biggest players on the defensive side of the ball. They start right in front of the offensive line, and their job is to stop running plays and put pressure on the quarterback.

*down
Each down indicates how close a team is to losing the ball, and the offense has four downs to cross the first down marker and get a new first down. A down is lost after almost every play, but some penalties can cause the down to be repeated.

*end zone
Each team has an end zone, which is the decorated 10-yard area on each end of the football field.

*extra point
An extra point is like a field goal, but it is kicked right after a touchdown from a specified yard line near the opponents' end zone.

*FD

&quot;FD&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;first down.&quot; See &quot;down.&quot;

*field goal (FG)
If a team attempts to kick the football through its opponents' crossbar, it is said to kick a field goal. The field goal is deemed to be &quot;good&quot; if the ball flies over the horizontal bar, and the kicking team receives three points and kicks off; otherwise, it is &quot;no good.&quot;

*forced fumble
If a defensive player pulls the ball from a player's hands, the fumble is said to be a forced fumble.

*fullback (FB)

The fullback can run with the ball, but his primary job is to block for the halfback. He may get the ball if the team needs a few yards.

*fumble
If a player has control of the ball and loses it before his knees hit the ground, the player is said to fumble and the ball can be claimed by any player on the field as long as it is in play.

*halfback (HB)

The halfback is the running back who usually runs with the ball on running plays and tends to be smaller and faster than the fullback.

*home field advantage
When a team hosts a game, it is said to have home field advantage.

*home team
The team that hosts the game is called the home team.

*interception (INT)
If a defensive player catches the ball before his knees touch the ground, the ball is intercepted and the defense gains possession.

*kickoff

A kickoff occurs when a team must kick to another team. The kicking team generally must keep the ball from crossing the sidelines.

*linebacker (LB)

The linebackers are behind the defensive line in defensive plays, and they tend to be smaller and faster than defensive linemen, but bigger and slower than defensive backs. They defend the run and the pass.

*National Football League(NFL)
The NFL is the major professional football league in North America and arbiter of professional football as it is mainly known.

*offense

Like &quot;defense,&quot; the meaning of &quot;offense&quot; is not quite clear. The offense is either the team with possession of the ball, the team that starts off with the ball, or the team with offensive players on the field.

*offensive line

The offensive line starts out at the line of scrimmage, with the center in the middle snapping the ball to the quarterback. It blocks defenders to keep them from tackling the running back and give the quarterback enough time to find an open receiver and throw an accurate pass.

*onside kick

If a team kicks the football to the side in order to get the ball back, the kick is known as an onside kick. It is possible for the receiving team to tell when an onside kick is being performed because the kicking team will line up mostly on one side of the field.

*playoffs
The playoffs are a tournament designed to have the teams with the best seasons compete(for more details, check out the football season chapter).Although it is a single elimination tournament, it is not a pure bracket system in the NFL because twelve teams compete.

*point after touchdown(PAT)
See &quot;extra point.&quot;

*possession

The team that has control of the ball is said to have possession of the ball. This team, outside a safety, is the only team able to score.

*punt
If the offense kicks the ball to the defense in a situation where the offense has the option to go for it, the kick is known as a punt.

*quarterback (QB)
The quarterback is the leader of the offense and normally starts behind the center. For more information about offensive positions, go to the appropriate chapter.

*referee

The referee is one of the officials. He is the highest arbiter of calls on the field.

*running back (RB)

A running back is a person who normally carries the ball for yardage on running plays. This is either a halfback or fullback.

*squib kick

A squib kick is a kick where the ball flies lower than usual. It is likely to be a compromise between the onside and standard kicks.

*Super Bowl
The Super Bowl is the championship game in the NFL playoffs. In the Super Bowl, one team is the AFC champion and one team is the NFC champion.

*tailback

See &quot;halfback.&quot;

*tight end

Tight ends are players that begin plays on either side of the defensive line. They can block or catch passes.

*touchback
If the ball falls into a team's end zone and bounces without being caught, a member of that team touches the end zone with the ball without first being outside the end zone, or an intercepting player is tackled before being outside his end zone, it is said to be a touchback and that team starts from its own 20 yard line. In college football, if a pylon (the short red sticks at the corners of the end zone) is touched with the football, that end zone's team gets a touchback.

*touchdown (TD)
If a member of one team catches or carries the ball in the opponents' end zone without being called out of bounds, the team with the ball scores a touchdown, which is worth six points, and an opportunity to score more points in an extra point or two point conversion.

*two point conversion
After a touchdown, the scoring team may attempt a two point conversion, where the offense gets one play to reach the opponents' end zone from a specified yard line, normally the 2 or 3 yard line. If the defense gains possession, what happens varies from game to game. In some games(including NFL games), the attempt is &quot;no good&quot; if a defensive player obtains possession of the ball. In others, the defense can return the ball to the far end zone for two points.

*visiting team

The team that does not host the game is called the visiting or away team.

*wide receiver (WR)

The wide receivers may be the most important players on the offense except for the quarterback. They usually catch the ball on passing plays, but they may also try to lure cornerbacks and safeties away from the line of scrimmage on run plays. Receivers are getting taller in pro football, so cornerbacks are having a harder time stopping the pass.

*wild card team
A wild card team is one of the two teams in an NFL conference with the best standings that are not champions of their divisions.

*Wild Card Weekend
In Wild Card Weekend, each wild card team plays against a division champion, and the champion hosts the game.

*wingback

[[Arithmetic]] is the study and use of numbers and their relationships, whilst '''Algebra''' uses letters as a preliminary substitute for numbers.

Unknown numbers are often given the letters x, y and z, while the temporary substitutes for known numbers may be a, A, b, B, c, A1, FF,  etc. Algebra also comes up with various simplifications.

==An example==

How to calculate wages to be paid:
*Employee A worked 50 hours at 10 per hour, total is 50 times 10 = 500
*Employee B worked 45 hours at 10 per hour, total is 45 times 10 = 450, etc. - That is arithmetic.

In algebraic terms, this same table could be express as such: Let h = the number of hours worked, and r = the rate of pay per hour.
*Then t = the total to be paid = h times r 
*Note that this covers the calculation for ALL employees, just &lt;u&gt;substitute&lt;/u&gt; the correct numbers for each of the letters, as the case may be.
*For Employee A: h = 50, r = 10, and t = h times r, therefore t= 500
*For Employee B: h = 45, r = 10, and t = h times r, therefore t = 450

==Closure==
'''Closure''' is a term which describes a relationship between an operation and a set.  A set is said to be '''closed''' under a certain operation if any application of the given operation applied between members of the set yields another member of the set.
===Examples===
* The set of integers is closed under addition, multiplication, and exponentiation, but not division.
* The set of complex numbers is closed under addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and division.
* The set of odd integers is not closed under addition.

==Modular Arithmetic==
Modular arithmetic acts like regular arithmetic, except that it is dealing only with remainders with respect to a certain number.  We call the number the modulus and refer to arithmetic modulo the given number.

===Example===
* &lt;math&gt;Z_4&lt;/math&gt; is the set of integers modulo 4.  The elements of &lt;math&gt;Z_4&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;

==Groups==
A group is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(G,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; where '''G''' is a set closed under the operation &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;.  The integers modulo any integer form a group.

In computing, the term is used figuratively. Many graphical user interfaces (GUI) use a desktop metaphor. It consists of the screen contents &quot;below&quot; any windows, hence what is on the screen before any windows are opened, and what reappears when windows are closed. It usually shows icons for programs, documents or folders and possibly an image as wallpaper.

Hi I am Smartsmith, I am a native speaker of Sinhalese and Bahasa Indonesia because of my mixed heritage but I suck at speaking them. Nowadays I speak mainly English and also learn Malay(Bahasa Melayu). I also learn Chinese as a Third Language.I have been using [[Wikipedia]] for about 2 years mainly for research in my studies. I became a member in early 2005. I am currently studying in the Gifted Education Programme in [[Singapore]]). I am keen in [[Biology]] therefore I am interested in [[Sci-Fi]] [[movies]]. So far I have contributed more than 100 times to wikipedia articles mostly editing the same page a few times. I also like [[LIVESTRONG headband]]s(the first wikipedia article which I created)now it is on the end of this page as the original page was deleted. I have also created the [[Pear Garden]] page about the Pear Garden opera troupe, which was formed during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. I also contributed the book '1984' by George Orwell, in wikibooks but i contributed the first chapter without creating an account so it shows my IP adress.</text>

== Overview ==

'''''Peskipiksi Pesternomi''''' is not a real spell.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This spell appears to be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Gilderoy Lockhart]]'s attempt at a spell to disperse the Cornish [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pixie|Pixie]]s he released in one of his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] classes, but it didn't work, and it might even have further irritated the pixies in question. The immediate result seems to have been that one of the pixies grabbed Lockhart's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|wand]] and threw it out the window.

== Analysis ==

The spell incantation seems to be based on the English phrase &quot;Pesky pixie, pester no me&quot;. As most real spells seem to have incantations that derive from Latin words, the fact that this one is based on an English phrase makes it immediately suspect.

Given the nature of his actual magical expertise, which we discover late in the books, it is uncertain whether Lockhart had ever really tried to use this spell. Equally, it is uncertain whether he created this spell himself, or was given it by someone who didn't completely trust him. We see throughout the book that the teachers at Hogwarts seem to have a very low opinion of Lockhart's magical skill.

The purpose of this spell seems to be purely to point up Lockhart's incompetence.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Espo111. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Espo111~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

I have returned from my holidays. [[User:Moonlightembrace|Moonlightembrace]] 17:54, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Spider==

One problem: araña is spider. Arachna isn't a word ''según la RAE.''

This is definitely the case, and I have tried to correct it as best I can, but I would suggest using a different word to introduce the concept--[[User:Squeakfox|Squeakfox]] 22:51, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Lol, yeah, my girlfriend corrected me on araña. What would you suggest? [[User:Moonlightembrace|Moonlightembrace]] 17:50, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Structure==

I'm changing the structure a bit, and creating a new Book, Book X, which can be used with or without the public domain books. Comments on the structure can be placed here.

==Random Comments==

I'm truely flattered with all this response. I abandoned the project, but now, thanks to you, I'm back. -ME

Sounds like a good project. I'm not advanced or beginner, but I'll watch the page and maybe help out.  -user unknown

I'm another with mid-level Spanish, and therefore not good as a helper for this.  It sounds like a great way to slowly get immersed in Spanish.  -Maya

----

I suggest that another book rather than ''Peter Pan'' be chosen, as it is not public domain in Great Britain. &amp;mdash;[[User:Wereon|Wereon]] 13:06, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)

I wasn't aware of Peter Pan not being public domain in Britain. We can always use another Oz book or something else. We will find something when we cross that bridge.

count me in as one of the unwashed non-speakers willing to peruse and comment!

I'll be glad to peruse and comment as well if it means I don't have to wash.  Learning Spanish the wrong way is a worthy endeavor. [[User:Paul Donnelly|Paul Donnelly]]

----

This sounds like a great project. I would like to know who started it? Also, I would gladly read it.
[[User:Michael Ellerbeck|Michael Ellerbeck]]

I started it, and abandoned it. My bad. I'm back - ME (moonlight embrace)

I'm in :o) I have little to no Spanish, and it looks like a muy fantastic way to aprendar. [[User:unclekensson|unclekensson]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a mnemonic dictionary. Every word has its pronunciation, meaning, and a little sentence to help you remember the word and its meaning.

A mnemonic phrase is worthless without the right connections for your memory, the BEST way to remember what an orange is in Spanish is to get an orange, feel it's peel, smell the skin, listen to the sound when you cut through the peel, feel the resistance give way as the knife penetrates, take in that bright, vibrant, orange color of the flesh, taste the sweet tangy juices, ''smell'' the juices, feel rippled, slippery skin all the while connecting the essence of an orange to how Spanish expresses it: ''naranja''.

The WORST way is to memorize a rhyme connecting a pun on the color orange to the fruit orange.  Three unrelated steps: reading a rhyme (something processed in a totally different part of the brain,) the color orange, and then an actual orange.  It might work to get an &quot;A&quot; on a test, but you will have a stutter when you are in Mexico.

Used correctly a Mnemonic phrase is somewhere in between the two extremes of true understanding and rote memorization.  With enough practice, especially in an immersion environment, the brain will make the direct connection to naranja circumventing the Mnemonic phrase, but [http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9801/23/t_t/bilingual.brain/ never] like our &quot;first&quot; language.

The &quot;correct&quot; way, or more awkwardly the ''most'' correct way, to use Mnemonics is to incorporate as much of the essence of the thing being memorized into as ''many'' senses in the ''most'' ridiculous way possible.

If you flipped to the back of a Mnemonic phrasebook for a passage on the name &quot;Zach&quot; you might find the following:

'''Zach''' (z-ack)

* Zach Attack.

Simple, stupid, a little funny.  It will work, but not as well as vividly imagining Zach's face with a wild look rushing you with with butcher knife dripping in blood- or even better a few chunks of brain still stuck on.  Just try and forget that. And if Zach's voice is a notable feature, have him screaming in a high pitch or nasal tone or just mumbling as his big frame stumbles toward you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is another of the series of A-level wikibooks. This book is based on the OCR and AQA A-Level Biology specifications, but is not endorsed by either exam board. It should be useful as a revision guide or to find alternative explanations to the ones in your textbook. 

This book assumes that you have completed GCSE science. If there are problems with this book, in clarity or a conflict with the syllabus, please feel free to post on the discussion page or to edit it.  Useful Assessment Statements for AS&amp;A2 Biology can be found in the [[IB Biology]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Zoph is being developped on Linux, but it should be able to run on any OS that can run Apache, MySQL and PHP. Users have reported succesful installations on MacOSX, several BSD flavours and even Windows.
Debian and Ubuntu users can install Zoph from apt by typing &lt;tt&gt;apt-get zoph&lt;/tt&gt; and Gentoo users could use the webapps overlay, although both are now quite outdated.

Zoph requires the following:
* Apache 2.2
* PHP 5.3, 5.4 or 5.5
* MySQL 5.1
* ImageMagick 6.6
* Jhead 2.8x
Other versions may work as well, see below for more details. How to install these applications and get them to work together is depending on your OS and distribution. Check the documentation of the application and/or your distribution for details.
==Apache==
* Current versions of Zoph are developped on Apache 2.2.x
** 2.0.x probably works too, but is no longer tested.

==PHP==
Current versions of Zoph are developped on PHP 5.4
* PHP 5.2 and older are no longer supported
* PHP 5.3 should still work


===Required features===
*The following features (extensions) to PHP are required for Zoph. Not all distributions automatically install all of them.
**session
**mysql
**pcre
**gd2
**exif
**xml
**pear (if you want to use the e-mail features)
**APC
**FileInfo 

===&lt;tt&gt;php.ini&lt;/tt&gt; settings===
Settings you may need to change in &lt;tt&gt;php.ini&lt;/tt&gt;:
====&lt;tt&gt;max_input_time&lt;/tt&gt;====
This is the time Zoph is allowed by PHP to spend waiting for the file to be uploaded. Depending on the size of your files and the speed of your server's connection, 30 seconds (the default) is usually enough to process single images, if you are uploading zip or tar files, you may want to increase this to 60 or 120 seconds.
====&lt;tt&gt;max_execution_time&lt;/tt&gt;====
This is the time Zoph is allowed by PHP to run. Depending on the speed of your webserver, Zoph could spend quite a lot of time resizing an image. 30 seconds may not be enough, especially if you have a camera with a lot of megapixels. 
====&lt;tt&gt;memory_limit&lt;/tt&gt;====
This is the amount of memory PHP allows Zoph to use. Especially if you have large images, the default (8 or 16 Megabyte) may not be enough. If you have sufficient memory in your server, setting it to 128M is perfectly safe.

* If you are using the web importer you may need to increase the &lt;tt&gt;max_execution_time&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;upload_max_filesize&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;post_max_size&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;max_input_time&lt;/tt&gt; in php.ini defined in &lt;tt&gt;php.ini&lt;/tt&gt;. See [[Zoph/Configuration#MAX_UPLOAD|MAX_UPLOAD]] on the [[Zoph/Configuration|Configuration]] page.
* If you are using the watermarking feature, you probably need to increase the &lt;tt&gt;memory_limit&lt;/tt&gt; setting. See [[Zoph/Configuration#WATERMARKING|WATERMARKING]] on the [[Zoph/Configuration|Configuration]] page.
* The e-mail photo feature may require increasing the &lt;tt&gt;memory_limit&lt;/tt&gt; setting. See [[Zoph/Configuration#EMAIL_PHOTOS|EMAIL_PHOTOS]] on the [[Zoph/Configuration|Configuration]] page.

====APC settings====
The file upload feature of Zoph v0.8.2 and later uses the PHP APC extension to track upload progress.
 apc.enabled = &quot;1&quot;
 apc.rfc1867=&quot;1&quot;
 apc.rfc1867_prefix=&quot;upload_&quot;
 apc.rfc1867_name=&quot;APC_UPLOAD_PROGRESS&quot;

==MySQL==
* Current versions are developped with MySQL 5.1
* MySQL 5.0 should work too
* MySQL 4.0 and 4.1 may still work but are no longer supported.

==ImageMagick==
* Current Zoph versions have been tested against ImageMagick 6.7.x

==Jhead==
* Jhead 2.8x
** Other versions probably work as well
Jhead is a handy little program that extracts the information stored in the Exif headers that are added by most digital cameras. Exif stores date and time plus a bunch of other info about a photo. Zoph uses Jhead to parse the header so you'll need to install it. You can download it from http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/.

==Browser==
In order to be able to use Zoph, you will need a browser. 
* Zoph is being developped and thoroughly tested with Firefox 24.x
* Zoph should work with all recent browser versions.
** Please report a bug if it doesn't.
* Older versions usually work, but layout may not be 100% ok.
* Some features require Javascript support
** You can turn off Javascript support in Zoph with the [[Zoph/Configuration#JAVASCRIPT|JAVASCRIPT]] configuration setting. Obviously features that require it will be disabled as well.
** Zoph should work when Javascript is turned off in the browser, except if the Autocomplete feature is enabled, however, Zoph will detect this and warn the user to turn Autocompletion off (or Javascript on).

==Resized image generation==

Zoph automatically creates thumbnails and medium sized ('mid') images during import. To influence this proces, you can edit the following parameters:

{{Important|The options in this section have a matching setting in &lt;tt&gt;ZophImport.pl&lt;/tt&gt;. These have to be set the same.}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=THUMB_SIZE|Versions=All versions|Description=Maximum width or height of thumbnails|Default=120|Options=Maximum width/height in pixels|Example=define('THUMB_SIZE', 120);}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=MID_SIZE|Versions=All versions|Description=Maximum width or height of 'mid' sized images|Default=480|Options=Maximum width/height in pixels|Example=define('MID_SIZE', 480);}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=THUMB_PREFIX|Versions=All versions|Description=Prefix of the filenames for the thumbnails.|Default=thumb|Options=Do not make this string empty!|Example=define('THUMB_PREFIX', 'thumb');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=MID_PREFIX|Versions=All versions|Description=Prefix of the filenames for the 'mid' sized images.|Default=thumb|Options=Do not make this string empty!|Example=define('MID_PREFIX', 'mid');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=MIXED_THUMBNAILS|Versions=0.3 to 0.9|Description=Convert thumbnails to JPEGs. This setting should match what is in zophImporter.pl. If you are installing Zoph for the first time, it is recommend to set this to 0 and change zophImport.pl accordingly. If you are upgrading, see the [[Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph_0.2.1_-.3E_0.3_Upgrade]] for more information about this.|Default=1|Options=&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: Behave like older Zoph versions. &lt;tt&gt;0:&lt;/tt&gt; Zoph will assume all thumbnails have the extension specified in [[Zoph/Configuration#THUMB_EXTENSION|THUMB_EXTENSION]]. |Example=define('MIXED_THUMBNAILS', '0');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=THUMB_EXTENSION|Versions=0.3 to 0.9|Description=Extension for thumbnail files|Default=JPG|Options=See . This setting is ignored if [[Zoph/Configuration#THUMB_EXTENSION|MIXED_THUMBNAILS]] is set to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;|Example=define('THUMB_EXTENSION', 'jpg');}}

==Rotating images==
{{ZophConfig|Option=ALLOW_ROTATIONS|Versions=0.4 to 0.9|Description=Images can be rotated from the webinterface. This option determines whether this feature is available.|Default=1|Options=&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: Allow rotations, &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: Rotating from webinterface disabled|Example=define('ALLOW_ROTATIONS', 0);}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=ROTATE_CMD|Versions=0.4 to 0.9|Description=Images can be rotated from the webinterface. This is done using an external (shell) command. This option determines which program is used|Default=convert|Options=&lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt;: use ImageMagick's &lt;tt&gt;convert&lt;/tt&gt; command to rotate images. '''WARNING''': this is a lossy rotate function, &lt;tt&gt;jpegtran&lt;/tt&gt;: use &lt;tt&gt;jpegtran&lt;/tt&gt; from the Independant JPEG group to perform a lossless rotate. This only works for JPEG images. |Example=define('ROTATE_CMD', 'jpegtran');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=BACKUP_ORIGINAL|Versions=0.4 to 0.9|Description=Images can be rotated from the webinterface. This option determines whether Zoph keeps a copy of the original file. The backup filename is prepended with [[Zoph/Configuration#BACKUP_PREFIX|BACKUP_PREFIX]].|Default=1|Options=&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: Keep original. &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: Do not keep original.|Example=define('BACKUP_ORIGINAL', 0);}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=BACKUP_PREFIX|Versions=0.4 to 0.9|Description=Images can be rotated from the webinterface. [[Zoph/Configuration#BACKUP_ORIGINAL|BACKUP_ORIGINAL]] determines whether Zoph keeps a copy of the original file. If it does, the backup filename is prepended with the prefix set in this option.|Default='orig_'|Options=Any (short) prefix string. It is recommended to end it with an underscore.|Example=define('BACKUP_PREFIX', 'backup_');}}

==Database configuration==
Before 0.8.2, the database settings were set in &lt;tt&gt;config.inc.php&lt;/tt&gt; (for the web interface) and &lt;tt&gt;.zophrc&lt;/tt&gt; (CLI interface), as of Zoph 0.8.2, these settings are all made in &lt;tt&gt;[[Zoph/Configuration/zoph.ini|zoph.ini]]&lt;/tt&gt;.

{{ZophConfig|Option=DB_HOST|Versions=0.8.1 and before|Description=Your database host|Default=&lt;tt&gt;localhost&lt;/tt&gt;|Options=Any hostname or IP address|Example=define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=DB_NAME|Versions=0.8.1 and before|Description=Name of the database, as it was created during installation|Default=&lt;tt&gt;zoph&lt;/tt&gt;|Options=|Example=define('DB_NAME', 'zoph');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=DB_USER|Versions=0.8.1 and before|Description=Name of the user that is used to connect to the MySQL database|Default=&lt;tt&gt;zoph_rw&lt;/tt&gt;|Options=|Example=define('DB_USER', 'zoph_rw');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=DB_PREFIX|Versions=0.4 to 0.8.1|Description=Prefix for MySQL table names. This prefix is added before all the table names in the MySQL database. With this option you could make Zoph share a database with another application or have 2 Zoph installations share one database.|Default='zoph_'|Options=|Example=define('DB_PREFIX', '');}}

==Image location==
{{ZophConfig|Option=IMAGE_DIR|Versions=All versions prior to 0.9.1|Description=Location of the images on the filesystem.|Default=/data/images/|Options=Any directory on the filesystem. Make sure it ends with a &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;!|Example=define('IMAGE_DIR', '/data/images/');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=WEB_IMAGE_DIR|Versions=All versions prior to v0.9|Description=This setting is only needed when [[Zoph/Configuration#USE_IMAGE_SERVICE|USE_IMAGE_SERVICE]]. Location of the images relative to the webserver root.|Default=/data/images/|Options=This directory should point to the same location as [[Zoph/Configuration#IMAGE_DIR|IMAGE_DIR]], but now seen from the webserver. Configure Apache so that this is correct. Make sure it ends with a &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;!|Example=define('WEB_IMAGE_DIR', '/images/');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=USE_IMAGE_SERVICE|Versions=All versions prior to v0.9|Description=This setting defines wheter photo's will be pulled directly from the filesystem by the webserver or to use &lt;tt&gt;image_service.php&lt;/tt&gt;.|Default=1 (0 in v0.5.1 and earlier)|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: Take images from filesystem or &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: Use &lt;tt&gt;image_service.php&lt;/tt&gt;.
The latter could be slightly lower in performance, but is highly recommended as it is more secure in combination with user access rights. Image service is required to be on if you wish to use watermarking or annotated photos. For this reason the option has been deprecated as of v0.8.1, and should always be on. In v0.9 this option will be removed and it will not be possible to use Zoph without the image service.
|Example=define('IMAGE_SERVICE', '1');}}
==CLI settings==
{{ZophConfig|Option=CLI_USER|Versions=0.8.2 to 0.9|Description=This is the Zoph user that is used when using the CLI interface when interacting with Zoph. You should set it to the user_id of a valid Zoph user. This user must be an admin user. You can also set it to '0', which means Zoph will lookup the name of the Unix user starting the CLI client and tries to find that user's name in the Zoph database.|Default=1|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: lookup Unix user by name &lt;tt&gt;&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: lookup Zoph user by user id.|Example=define('CLI_USER', '0');}}

With this option on (&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;) an admin user, or a user with import rights, can import files placed in the [[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_DIR|IMPORT_DIR]] into Zoph. If you want users to be able to upload as well, you need to enable [[Zoph/Configuration#UPLOAD|UPLOAD]]. As of v0.8.2, Zoph requires Javascript for uploading and importing, so you need to enable [[Zoph/Configuration#JAVASCRIPT|JAVASCRIPT]].|Default=1|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: disable, or &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: enable importing.|Example=define('IMPORT', '1');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=UPLOAD|Versions=0.8.2 to 0.9|Description=Use this option to enable or disable uploading files.

Don't change this, unless you have a fast server with multiple CPU's or cores.|Example=define('IMPORT_PARALLEL', 2);}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=MAGIC_FILE|Versions=0.8.2 to 0.9|Description=Zoph needs a MIME Magic file to be able to determine the filetype of an uploaded file. This is an important security measure, since it prevents users from uploading files other than images and archives. If left empty, PHP will use the built-in Magic file, if for some reason this does not work, you can specify the location of the MIME magic file.|Default=''&lt;empty&gt;''|Options=Empty, to use PHP's built-in MIME Magic file or the full path to a MIME Magic file. Where this file is located, depends on your distribution, &lt;tt&gt;/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/usr/share/misc/file/magic.mgc&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/usr/share/file/magic&lt;/tt&gt; are often used.|Example=define('MAGIC_FILE', '/usr/share/file/magic.mime');}}

You can have Zoph automatically add today's date to the path by using &lt;tt&gt;date(''format'')&lt;/tt&gt;, where format is a format string like [http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php PHP's date() function], without quotes. Please note that this is the date the import is being done, not the date the photo was taken, use [[Zoph/Configuration#USE_DATED_DIRS|USE_DATED_DIRS]] if you want that. As of Zoph 0.8.2, this option is no longer used, as all files are initially placed in [[Zoph/Configuration#IMPORT_DIR|IMPORT_DIR]]
|Default=uploads/date(Y.m.d)|Options=|Example=define('DEFAULT_DESTINATION_PATH', 'date(Y-M)');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=SHOW_DESTINATION_PATH|Versions=0.4 until 0.8.1|Description=This determines whether or not the value configured by [[Zoph/Configuration#DEFAULT_DESTINATION_PATH|DEFAULT_DESTINATION_PATH]] is visible/editable by a user. Please note that this is a ''usability'' feature and not a ''security'' feature, a user who has import rights can easily edit the value when changing the HTML file, then again, you shouldn't give untrustable users import rights.
This option is ignored for admin users, there it is always shown|Default=0|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: do not show, or &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: show the destination path field |Example=define('SHOW_DESTINATION_PATH', '1');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=REMOVE_ARCHIVE|Versions=0.5 until 0.8.1|Description=Remove the .tar or .zip file after a successful import.|Default=0|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: leave the file, or &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: remove the file. As of v0.8.2, Zoph always removes the archive on a succesful extract of that archive.|Example=define('REMOVE_ARCHIVE', '0');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=IMPORT_MOVE|Versions=0.7.1 until 0.8.1|Description=Move, instead of copy the image from the default import location to the final location. In this way no duplicate files will be around. As of v0.8.2 this option is removed.|Default=0|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: copy the file, or &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: move the file |Example=define('IMPORT_MOVE', '0');}}


{{ZophConfig|Option=IMPORT_UMASK|Versions=0.8.1 and before|Description=Specifies the file permissions that are assigned to files created by Zoph. This value is subtracted from the default chmod-file permissions of 666, so a umask of 022 means that the file permissions will become 644 (rw for owner, r for group and others) . This option has been replaced with [[Zoph/Configuration#FILE_MODE|FILE_MODE]]|Default=022|Options=Any value that can be subtracted from the default 666 mode, keep in mind that an image should not be executable, but that it should be readable by Zoph.|Example=define('IMPORT_UMASK', '026');}}

==Features==
{{ZophConfig|Option=JAVASCRIPT|Versions=0.7 to 0.9|Description=Use this parameter to turn on or off all Javascript usage. This will disable all features that need Javascript.|Default=1|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: no Javascript, &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: use Javascript|Example=define('JAVASCRIPT', '1');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=EMAIL_PHOTOS|Versions=All versions prior to 0.9.1|Description=You can enable or disable the &quot;mail this photo&quot; feature&quot; using this option. Since Zoph needs to convert the photo into Base64 encoding for mail, it requires quite a large amount of memory if you try to send ''full size'' images and you may need to adjust &lt;tt&gt;memory_limit&lt;/tt&gt; in php.ini, you should give it at least about 4 times the size of your largest image.|Default=0|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: disable mail, &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: enable mail|Example=define('EMAIL_PHOTOS', '1');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=WATERMARKING|Versions=0.5 to 0.9|Description=Turn the watermarking feature on or off.|Default=0|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: watermarking is disabled; &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: watermarking is enabled. Watermarking only works if [[Zoph/Configuration#IMAGE_SERVICE|IMAGE_SERVICE]] is enabled and [[Zoph/Configuration#WATERMARK|WATERMARK]] is set to an existing GIF image. Please note that enabling this function uses a rather large amount of memory on the webserver. PHP by default allows a script to use a maximum of 8MB memory. You should probably increase this by changing &lt;tt&gt;memory_limit&lt;/tt&gt; in php.ini. A rough estimation of how much memory it will use is 6 times the number of megapixels in your camera. For example, if you have a 5 megapixel camera, change the line in &lt;tt&gt;php.ini&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;memory_limit=30M&lt;/tt&gt;|Example=define('WATERMARKING', '1');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=WATERMARK|Versions=0.5 to 0.9|Description=If watermarking is used, this should be set to the name of the file that will be used as the watermark. It should be a GIF file, for best results, use contrasting colours and transparency. In the Contrib directory, 3 example files are included. The filename is relative to the [[Zoph/Configuration#IMAGE_DIR|IMAGE_DIR]].|Default=watermark.gif|Options=|Example=define('WATERMARK', 'watermarks/topsecret.gif');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=WM_POSX|Versions=0.7.1 to 0.9|Description=Define where the [[Zoph/Configuration#WATERMARK|watermark]] will be placed horizontally.|Default=center|Options=&lt;tt&gt;left&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;center&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;centre&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;right&lt;/tt&gt;|Example=define('WM_POSX', 'right');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=WM_POSY|Versions=0.7.1 to 0.9|Description=Define where the [[Zoph/Configuration#WATERMARK|watermark]] will be placed vertically.|Default=center|Options=&lt;tt&gt;top&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;center&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;centre&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;bottom&lt;/tt&gt;|Example=define('WM_POSY', 'bottom');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=WM_TRANS|Versions=0.7.1 to 0.9|Description=Define the transparency of a [[Zoph/Configuration#WATERMARK|watermark]].|Default=50|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: fully tranparent (invisible, don't use this, it's pointless and eats up a lot of resources, better turn off the [[Zoph/Configuration#WATERMARK|watermark]] feature altogether) to &lt;tt&gt;100&lt;/tt&gt;: no transparency.|Example=define('WM_TRANS', 25);}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=ALLOW_COMMENTS|Versions=0.6 to 0.9|Description=Enable comments. Before a user can actually leave comments, you should also give the user these rights through the edit user screen.|Default=0|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: disable comments &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: enable comments|Example=define('ALLOW_COMMENTS', 1);}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=AUTOCOMPLETE|Versions=0.7 to 0.9|Description=With this feature you can use &quot;Web 2.0&quot; autocompletion for select-boxes (Albums, Categories, Places, People)|Default=1|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: use standard HTML select-boxes; &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: Use autocompletion select-boxes. This feature needs [[Zoph/Configuration#JAVASCRIPT|JAVASCRIPT]] to be enabled.|Example=define('AUTOCOMPLETE', 1);}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=DOWNLOAD|Versions=0.7.1 to 0.9|Description=With this feature you can use download a set of photos (Albums, Categories, Places, People or a search result) in one or more ZIP files. '''Important''' the photos in the ZIP file will &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; be watermarked.|Default=0|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: disable this feature; &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: Enable this feature. You must also grant each non-admin user you want to give these rights permission by changing &quot;can download zipfiles&quot; in the user's profile.|Example=define('DOWNLOAD', 1);}}


==Mapping Support==
{{ZophConfig|Option=MAPS|Versions=0.7.3 to 0.9|Description=With this setting you can enable mapping support for Zoph. Mapping is provided through the use of the [http://www.mapstraction.com/ Mapstraction abstraction layer], which enables support for many different mapping providers. You will need to enable Javascript throught the [[Zoph/Configuration#JAVASCRIPT|JAVASCRIPT]] setting.|Default=''|Options=&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;empty&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;: disable this feature;
:&lt;tt&gt;google&lt;/tt&gt;: Use Google Maps, you need to define [[Zoph/Configuration#GOOGLE_KEY|GOOGLE_KEY]] in order to be able to use Google Maps.,
:&lt;tt&gt;yahoo&lt;/tt&gt;: use Yahoo mapping or 
:&lt;tt&gt;openstreetmap&lt;/tt&gt;: use openstreetmap maps. Because this setting displays OpenStreetMap map tiles via the Google javascript API, you will also need to define [[Zoph/Configuration#GOOGLE_KEY|GOOGLE_KEY]].

It should be possible to use the other mapping providers or javascript map libraries [http://www.mapstraction.com/ Mapstraction] supports, but they have not been tested with Zoph and are therefore not supported.|Example=define('MAPS', 'google');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=GOOGLE_KEY|Versions=0.7.3 to 0.9|Description=In order to use Googles Mapping API, you will need to request an API key with Google. You can do this at [http://code.google.com/apis/maps http://code.google.com/apis/maps], you will need to provide the URL to your Zoph installation, mapping will generate an error when the URL is wrong.|Default='Get yours at http://code.google.com/apis/maps'|Options=An API key provided by Google. It will look something like this the one in the example, which is an invalid key, don't bother trying to use it.|Example=define('GOOGLE_KEY', 'DDQIBBBBhW0vWZf8f0AAPt_86WXJrGGG9jpr3jOoJTHbWArKj23UyhEyLxRRtnOiOR-RSvuLRF1bguT8Nkh2jQ');}}

==Timezone==
The following features are only available if your are running PHP 5.1.0 or later and are automatically disabled if you are not.
{{ZophConfig|Option=CAMERA_TZ|Versions=0.7.3 and later|Description=This setting determines the timezone to which your camera is set. Leave empty if you do not want to use this feature and always set your camera to the local timezone|Default=''|Options=Any timezone from this list http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php|Example=define('CAMERA_TZ', 'Europe/Amsterdam');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=DATE_FORMAT|Versions=0.7.3 to 0.9|Description=Define how Zoph displays date |Default='H:i:s T'|Options=See http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php for explanation.|Example=define('TIME_FORMAT', 'H:i:s');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=TIME_FORMAT|Versions=0.7.3 to 0.9|Description=Define how Zoph displays time |Default='d-m-Y'|Options=See http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php for explanation.|Example=define('DATE_FORMAT', 'Y-m-d');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=GUESS_TZ|Versions=0.7.3 to 0.9|Description=If you have defined the precise location of a place (using the mapping feature), Zoph can 'guess' the timezone based on this location. It uses the [http://www.geonames.org Geonames project] for this. This will, however, send information to their webserver, do not enable this feature if you're not comfortable with that.|Default=0|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: disable this feature, &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: enable this feature|Example=define('GUESS_TZ', 1);}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=SHARE|Versions=0.8.4 to 0.9|Description=Sometimes, you may wish to share an image in Zoph without creating a user account for those who will be watching them. For example, in order to post a link to an image on a forum or website. When this option is enabled, you will see a 'share' tab next to a photo, where you will find a few ways to share a photo, such as a url and a HTML &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tag. With this special url, it is possible to open a photo ''without'' logging in to Zoph. You can determine ''per user'' whether or not this user will see the tab and therefore the urls. If you use this function, you should set [[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE_SALT_FULL|SHARE_SALT_FULL]] and [[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE_SALT_MID|SHARE_SALT_MID]] to ''different'', ''long'' and ''secret'' values.|Default=0|Options=&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;: disable this feature, &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: enable this feature|Example=define('SHARE', 1);}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=SHARE_SALT_FULL|Versions=0.8.4 to 0.9|Description=When using the [[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE|SHARE]] feature, Zoph uses a hash to identify a photo. Because you do not want people who have access to you full size photos (via Zoph or otherwise) to be able to generate these hashes, you should give Zoph a secret [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29 salt] so only authorized users of your Zoph installation can generate them. The salt for full size images (this one) must be different from the salt of mid size images ([[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE_SALT_MID|SHARE_SALT_MID]]), because this allows Zoph to distinguish between them. If a link to your Zoph installation is being abused (for example because someone whom you mailed a link has published it on a forum), you can modify the salt to make '''all''' hash-based links to your Zoph invalid.|Default='Set this to a long secret string'|Options=Any string. Longer is better. Should be 10 characters at the very least. You will only need to store it here and there is no need to remember it, so there really is no excuse for using a short, easy salt.|Example=define('SHARE_SALT_FULL', '25fa82997b2ca1b13219dd7199cfe5e1539c41c5');}}

{{ZophConfig|Option=SHARE_SALT_MID|Versions=0.8.4 to 0.9|Description=When using the [[Zoph/Configuration#SHARE|SHARE]] feature, Zoph uses a hash to identify a photo.

__TOC__

The [[Ada Programming/Delimiters|delimiter]] '''..''' is used to specify [[Ada Programming/Types/range|ranges]] in any [[Ada Programming/Types|scalar type]].

For example:

* In numeric type definitions:
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Count {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 0 '''..''' Max_Count;

* In [[Ada Programming/Subtypes#Declaring subtypes|subtype]] definitions:
 {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Week_Day {{Ada/kw|is}} Day_Name {{Ada/kw|range}} Monday '''..''' Friday;

* In [[Ada Programming/Variables|variable]] declarations:
 Vector_A : Vector (0 '''..''' 31);

* In [[Ada Programming/Operators#Membership tests|membership tests]]:
 {{Ada/kw|exit}} {{Ada/kw|when}} X {{Ada/kw|in}} Y '''..''' Y + Epsilon;

* In [[Ada Programming/Control#loops|for loops]]:
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Day {{Ada/kw|in}} Day_Name {{Ada/kw|range}} Monday '''..''' Thursday {{Ada/kw|loop}}
    {{Ada/--|...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};

* In [[Ada Programming/Types/array|arrays]]:
 Vector_A (Vector_A'{{Ada/attribute|First}} .. Vector_A'{{Ada/attribute|First}} + Vector_B'{{Ada/attribute|Length}} - 1) := Vector_B;

== Usage notes ==

When a whole type range will be specified, it is better to use the {{Ada/attribute|Range}} attribute.

For example, instead of using:

 {{Ada/kw|for}} Day {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|range}} Day_Name'{{Ada/attribute|First}} '''..''' Day_Name'{{Ada/attribute|Last}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}
    {{Ada/--|...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
 
it is better to use:

 {{Ada/kw|for}} Day {{Ada/kw|in}} Day_Name'{{Ada/attribute|Range}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}
    {{Ada/--|...}}
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};

To reduce this flavor, it is recommend to use no more than 0.775% instant dry yeast expressed as a baker's %, alternatively, 2.5% cake yeast (compressed) or 1.05% active dry yeast.  Fermentation times should be around 2 hours for these reduced yeast amounts provided fermentation temperatures are about {{convert|80|F|C}}. Cooler temperatures will result in somewhat longer fermentation times.  Further yeast reductions will result in less yeast flavor and longer [[wikipedia:Straight dough|bulk fermentation]] times.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notes for my edit:
#たなかさん は せんせい だ ね: &quot;...だよね？&quot; is natural in this case.
#だいじょうぶ だなあ: It's strange. だいじょうぶさ or だいじょうぶだよ is okay.
#ぜ - ...with people whose social status is below the speaker's: No. You can use it to your friend as 「早く行こうぜ」
#わ - used only by women: No. A man usually say as 「わかった、じゃ3時に行くわ」. It's true that men don't use &quot;わよ&quot;.
- [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 15:24:38, 2005-08-27 (UTC)

: Doesn't わ usage by men vary a lot depending on the region? -[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 15:36, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

::Er... hmm... yeah. Or, at least, originally. It seems the usage originally from Kansai or western Japan. However, thanks to the TV, I feel not a small number of people(men and women) almost everywhere in Japan occasionally use &quot;わ&quot; of this kind ...but imagining about the number of the people who use it daily and the frequency it is used, appearently the main region is Kansai or western Japanese... Well, it's my mistake to erase the notice. Thanks for your edit, ToothingLummox. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 17:18:49, 2005-08-27 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Marsian,

Thanks for your corrections on the Japanese wiki! If you correct the Japanese, don't mark the change as minor. The Japanese is the most important thing on the page!

P.S. Where are you from? 何弁でしょうか。 

-[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 15:30, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

:Hello. All right, I won't check &quot;minor&quot; when I fix (forgive me please when I forget).

:I'm from a small city in [[w:Hokkaido|北海道]] (not Sapporo). Thus I can speak 北海道弁 a little :) 「...だべや」 or 「わや (very)」 or... kind of that.  Where are you from, ToothingLummox? Aren't you a Japanese? No? まぁそうだったらそうだったで，英語で会話する日本人同士ってのもなんか変な感じがしますが... - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 16:42:14, 2005-08-27 (UTC)

:: 私は日本人じゃないですから、 no need to worry about 変な感. I'm an American from near Washington, DC.  I spent a few years in Japan (「英語分からへん」or 「○○先生いひん？」 or「靴下投げんといて！」or (from an actual lesson) &quot;It's a dog&quot; =「犬やで」), but I still make plenty of Japanese mistakes. Your corrections to the Japanese Wikibook are much appreciated.  You're more than welcome to do it again sometime. -[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 13:24, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

:::I see. So you've been to Kansai or western Japanese. I myself have several friends from Kansai and mostly Kyushu and I like Kagoshima-ben much. I'm glad if my edits and/or comments improve the Book, thanks (but remember, anytime you can say to me 「ちょ、ほんまやかましいわ自分。黙っとき」 or like that :). - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 17:12:48, 2005-08-29 (UTC)

== English Corrections ==

I just wanted to point out that some of the corrections I made were more stylistic than grammatical. A lot of &quot;learner language&quot; falls into a gray area; it's not really wrong but it's not how most native speakers would say it. Anyway, since you don't actively study English, make sure that you actively pay attention when you encounter it. :) 

-[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 08:20, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

:All right... You know, your corrections are '''''really''''' helpful to(for?) me. I think I've got to pay back (by editing the Japanese book :). Thanks again. - 08:59, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

Thanks, very much!
# 六つ: This was a stupid mistake. It should have been むっつ, not むつ.
# As for the obsolete kanji and obsolete readings, the story is approx. 100 years old, so it will probably contain things that are no longer used. I think that it would be cool to keep them, but I added a note beside those words.
# The purpose of this page is to give people the chance to practice reading real Japanese, with all the words and grammar explained on the same page.
Your comments were very enjoyable to read, I hope you will be able to check the page every so often. [[User:Gmcfoley|Gmcfoley]] 21:34, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Marsian. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Marsian~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

== Overview ==

The '''''Sorting Hat''''' is described as being very old and patched. When the hat is put on the head of a Hogwarts new arrival, a mouth forms at the brim, and the hat states, for all to hear, which of the four school Houses the child wearing it belongs in: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. 

The Sorting Hat also sings a song for all of the Hogwarts students and staff before the beginning-of-the-year feast, describing its job and the four Hogwarts houses. However, when the wizarding world or the school is in any imminent danger, the hat will also sing about the importance of the four houses standing together as brothers and sisters in the fight against evil. 

The Sorting Hat's unusual qualities are due to the fact that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Godric Gryffindor|Godric Gryffindor]], one of the four Hogwarts founders, owned the hat, and knowing that he would not be around to select houses for the incoming students forever, placed a charm on it to do its job.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

In this book, the Sorting Hat was introduced as the means through which students are sorted into their respective houses.

Having sung its song, it was then placed on the head of each of the first-year students in turn. It then assigned each to a house. The Hat initially though that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] would do well in Slytherin, but Harry told it that he didn't want to go to Slytherin. The hat then placed him in Gryffindor.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

Because they were unable to make it onto the Hogwarts Express, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] are still outside the school when the Sorting commences. They see some of the Sorting proceeding through the window of the Great Hall, but are not present for the Sorting Hat's song.

Later in the book, where Harry is summoned to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore's]] office, he finds himself alone in the office with the Sorting Hat and decides to see if the Hat had had second thoughts about his Sorting. The Sorting Hat tells Harry again that he would have been great in Slytherin; Harry disagrees rather forcefully.

In the climactic battle against the Monster in the chamber, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes the phoenix]] drops the Sorting Hat at Harry's feet; Harry thinks this is useless, though he wears it in hopes that it might afford him some protection or at least counsel; and it shortly thereafter presents him with a sword. Harry uses the sword to kill the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|basilisk]] (the Monster).

Harry, having told all this to Professor Dumbledore, tells Dumbledore that the Sorting Hat had originally wanted to place Harry in Slytherin. Dumbledore asks Harry why it did not; Harry says that he had asked it not to. Dumbledore points out that &quot;it is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.&quot; Dumbledore then tells Harry that if he still wonders, he should examine the sword. Harry finds that it is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sword of Gryffindor|sword of Godric Gryffindor]]. Dumbledore tells him that only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that sword out of the Hat.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

News that Harry had reacted strongly to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] had been sent to the school by Owl ahead of time, so Harry is taken aside into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]'s office so he can be checked over by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]]. Professor McGonagall also wants a word with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]] and so draws her aside as well. As a result, when Harry reaches the Great Hall, the Sorting is finished, and all we see of the Sorting Hat is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] removing it and its three-legged stool from the stage.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Before the Sorting, the Hat again sings a song about the history of Hogwarts. Harry notes that it is a different song than the one he had heard his first year there, and Ron says that it is a different song every year. Being a hat, it can't have much to do most of the time, and so Ron surmises that it has a lot of time to make up its song.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Prior to the Sorting, the Hat sings a very much longer song than usual, specifically going into the history of Hogwarts and its founders, and the divisiveness that resulted. It ends with a plea for the four houses to work together in this time of trouble. Ron asks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] if the Hat has been known to sing in support of unity, and Nick replies that it has done so quite often, though he is interrupted by the Sorting. Once all the students have been Sorted, he continues that the Hat, being in the Headmaster's office almost all of the time, is aware of what is happening in the school and things that affect the school, and if it sees a problem will try, as best it can, to draw attention to it.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Due to the argument with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] on the Hogwarts Express, Harry arrives at the feast not only after the Sorting, but largely after the Feast has finished. As a result, we do not see the Sorting Hat at all in this book, except in passing when Harry, visiting the Headmaster's office, notices it sitting quietly on the shelf.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]]'s memories, we see the Sorting Hat as it Sorts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|Lily Evans]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]] into Gryffindor, and Snape into Slytherin.

At the Battle of Hogwarts, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] is forced by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] to wear the Sorting Hat. Voldemort then sets Neville on fire, but Neville is unhurt by Voldemort's curse, and pulls the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, just as Harry did in the Chamber of Secrets. Neville then kills Voldemort's snake [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]], the last of Voldemort's Horcruxes, making it possible for Voldemort to later die from his own reflected [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|killing curse]].

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Epilogue|Epilogue]] the Sorting Hat is mentioned, still doing its job at Hogwarts 19 years later. Harry here tells his son, Albus Severus, that he had asked the Hat not to put him in Slytherin, and it had placed him in Gryffindor instead.

== Strengths ==

The Sorting Hat's annual song reflects the issues and concerns of current events.  This implies that the hat has some ability, possibly through listening to passing events in the Headmaster's office, to keep up with the changes and threats to Hogwarts, and sufficient consciousness to understand them.

== Weaknesses ==

It is just a hat, and has only a certain amount of &quot;mind-reading&quot; ability and the power of speech. It cannot move, it can influence events around it only by persuasion, and apparently spends most of its time on a shelf in the headmaster's office.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

== Analysis ==

It is clear that the Hat has some level of consciousness; we hear that its song is different every year, and that its song reflects the need to deal with threats against Hogwarts. It also engages in conversation with Harry on two occasions, first when Harry is initially Sorted in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', and later when Harry dons the Hat in the Headmaster's office in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''. This is why the Hat is listed as a character, rather than as a magical artifact, in this guide. It is also, probably, why Professor Dumbledore says that the Sword of Gryffindor is the only known artifact of Godric Gryffindor; the Sorting Hat was clearly a possession of his, but its consciousness makes it not an artifact but a person.

The Sorting Hat has an affinity for the Sword of Gryffindor, as it has produced the sword twice now; possibly this affinity comes from the fact that both were the property of Godric Gryffindor, and he may have established that particular affinity himself. It also seems the Hat is capable of retrieving the Sword from anywhere, because [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] the goblin was the last possessor of the Sword of Gryffindor — he had taken it when Harry, Ron, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] raided Gringotts.

A '''[[w:subroutine|function]]''', which can also be referred to as [[w:subroutine|subroutine]], '''procedure''', '''subprogram''' or even [[w:Method_(computer_science)|method]], carries out tasks defined by a sequence of statements called a '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements|statement block]]''''' that need only be written once and ''called'' by a program as many times as needed to carry out the same task.

Functions may depend on variables passed to them, called '''''[[#Parameters and arguments|arguments]]''''', and may pass results of a task on to the caller of the function, this is called the ''[[w:Return statement|return value]]''.

It is important to note that a '''function''' that exists in the '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope|global scope]]''''' can also be called '''global function''' and a function that is defined inside a class is called a '''member function'''.  (The term '''method''' is commonly used in other programming languages to refer to things ''like'' member functions, but this can lead to confusion in dealing with C++ which supports both virtual and non-virtual dispatch of member functions.)

{{NOTE|note=
When talking or reading about programming, you must consider the language background and the topic of the source.
It is very rare to see a C++ programmer use the words '''procedure''' or '''subprogram''', this will vary from language to language.
In many programming languages the word '''function''' is reserved for subroutines that return a value, this is not the case with C++.
}}

=== Declarations ===
A function must be declared before being used, with a name to identify it, what type of value the function returns and the types of any arguments that are to be passed to it. Parameters must be named and declare what type of value it takes. Parameters should always be passed as ''const'' if their arguments are not modified. Usually functions performs actions, so the name should make clear what it does. By using verbs in function names and following other naming conventions programs can be read more naturally.

The next example we define a function named &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; that returns an integer value &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and takes no parameters. The content of the function is called the ''body'' of the function. The word &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; is a ''keyword''. C++ keywords are ''reserved words'', i.e., cannot be used for any purpose other than what they are meant for. On the other hand ''main'' is not a keyword and you can use it in many places where a keyword cannot be used (though that is not recommended, as confusion could result).
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int main()
{
  // code
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==== {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} ====
{{TODO|Merge and spread the info}}
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Keywords/inline}}

Normally when calling a function, a program will evaluate and store the arguments, and then call (or branch to) the function's code, and then the function will later return back to the caller.  While function calls are fast (typically taking much less than a microsecond on modern processors), the overhead can sometimes be significant, particularly if the function is simple and is called many times.

One approach which can be a performance optimization in some situations is to use so-called {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} functions.  Marking a function as {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} is a request (sometimes called a hint) to the compiler to consider replacing a ''call'' to the function by a copy of the code of that function.

The result is in some ways similar to the use of the #define macro, but as [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor#Macros|mentioned before]], macros can lead to problems since they are not evaluated by the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor|preprocessor]].  {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} functions do not suffer from the same problems.

If the inlined function is large, this replacement process (known for obvious reasons as &quot;inlining&quot;) can lead to &quot;code bloat&quot;, leading to bigger (and hence usually slower) code.  However, for small functions it can even reduce code size, particularly once a compiler's optimizer runs.

Note that the inlining process requires that the function's definition (including the code) must be available to the compiler.  In particular, inline headers that are used from more than one source file must be completely defined within a header file (whereas with regular functions that would be an error).

The most common way to designate that a function is inline is by the use of the {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} keyword. One must keep in mind that compilers can be configured to ignore the keyword and use their own optimizations.

Further considerations are given when dealing with [[C++ Programming/Classes/Member Functions#Inline|inline member function]], this will be covered on the '''[[C++ Programming/Chapter Object Oriented Programming|Object-Oriented Programming Chapter]]''' . 

{{TODO|Complete and give examples|C++ Programming}}

=== Parameters and arguments ===
The function declaration defines its parameters.  A parameter is a variable which takes on the meaning of a corresponding argument passed in a call to a function.

An argument represents the value you supply to a function parameter when you call it. The calling code supplies the arguments when it calls the function.

The part of the function declaration that declares the expected parameters is called the '''parameter list''' and the part of function call that specifies the arguments is called the '''argument list'''.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
//Global functions declaration
int subtraction_function( int parameter1, int parameter2 ) { return ( parameter1 - parameter2 ); }

//Call to the above function using 2 extra variables so the relation becomes more evident
int argument1 = 4;
int argument2 = 3; 
int result = subtraction_function( argument1, argument2 );
// will have the same result as
int result = subtraction_function( 4, 3 );
&lt;/source&gt;

Many programmers use parameter and argument interchangeably, depending on context to distinguish the meaning. In practice, distinguishing between the two terms is usually unnecessary in order to use them correctly or communicate their use to other programmers. Alternatively, the equivalent terms formal parameter and actual parameter may be used instead of parameter and argument.

=== Parameters ===
You can define a function with no parameters, one parameter, or more than one, but to use a call to that function with arguments you must take into consideration what is defined. 

==== Empty parameter list ====

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
//Global functions with no parameters
void function() { /*...*/ }
//empty parameter declaration equivalent the use of void
void function( void ) { /*...*/ }
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|This is the only valid case were ''void'' can be used as a parameter type, you can only derived types from ''void'' (ie: ''void*'' ).}}

==== Multiple parameters ====
The syntax for declaring and invoking functions with multiple parameters can be a source of errors. When you write the function definition, you must declare the type of each and every parameter.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Example - function using two int parameters by value
void printTime (int hour, int minute) { 
  std::cout &lt;&lt; hour; 
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;:&quot;; 
  std::cout &lt;&lt; minute; 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

It might be tempting to write (int hour, minute), but that format is only legal for variable declarations, not for parameter declarations.

However, you do not have to declare the types of arguments when you call a function. (Indeed, it is an error to attempt to do so). 

'''Example'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int main ( void ) {
    int hour = 11; 
    int minute = 59; 
    printTime( int hour, int minute ); // WRONG!
    printTime( hour, minute ); // Right!
}
&lt;/source&gt; 

In this case, the compiler can tell the type of hour and minute by looking at their declarations. It is unnecessary and illegal to include the type when you pass them as arguments.&lt;/code&gt;.

==== by pointer ====
A function may use pass by pointer when the object pointed to might not exist, that is, when you are giving either the address of a real object or NULL. Passing a pointer is not different to passing anything else. Its a parameter the same as any other. The characteristics of the pointer type is what makes it a worth distinguishing.

The passing of a pointer to a function is very similar to passing it as a reference. It is used to avoid the overhead of copying, and the slicing problem (since child classes have a bigger memory footprint that the parent) that can  occur when passing base class objects by value. This is also the preferred method in C (for historical reasons), were passing by pointer signifies that wanted to modify the original variable. In C++ it is preferred to use references to pointers and guarantee that the function before dereferencing it, verifies the pointer for validity.

{{TODO|Reorder, simplify and clarify|C++ Programming}}

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void MyFunc( int *x ) 
{ 
  std::cout &lt;&lt; *x &lt;&lt; std::endl; // See next section for explanation
} 
  
int main() 
{ 
  int i; 
  MyFunc( &amp;i ); 

  return 0; 
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

Since a reference is just an alias, it has exactly the same address as what it refers to, as in the following example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void ComparePointers (int * a, int * b)
{
  if (a == b)
    std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Pointers are the same!&quot;&lt;&lt;std::endl;
  else
    std::cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Pointers are different!&quot;&lt;&lt;std::endl;
}

int main()
{
  int i, j;
  int&amp; r = i;

  ComparePointers(&amp;i, &amp;i);
  ComparePointers(&amp;i, &amp;j);
  ComparePointers(&amp;i, &amp;r);
  ComparePointers(&amp;j, &amp;r);

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This program will tell you that the pointers are the same, then that they are different, then the same, then different again.

;Arrays are similar to pointers, remember?
Now might be a good time to reread the section on arrays.  If you do not feel like flipping back that far, though, here's a brief recap:  Arrays are blocks of memory space.  

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int my_array[5]; 
&lt;/source&gt;

In the statement above, &lt;tt&gt;my_array&lt;/tt&gt; is an area in memory big enough to hold five &lt;/code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s.  To use an element of the array, it must be ''dereferenced''.  The third element in the array (remember they're zero-indexed) is &lt;tt&gt;my_array[2]&lt;/tt&gt;.  When you write &lt;tt&gt;my_array[2]&lt;/tt&gt;, you're actually saying &quot;give me the third integer in the array &lt;tt&gt;my_array&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.  Therefore, &lt;tt&gt;my_array&lt;/tt&gt; is an array, but &lt;tt&gt;my_array[2]&lt;/tt&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.

; Passing a single array element
So let's say you want to pass one of the integers in your array into a function.  How do you do it?  Simply pass in the dereferenced element, and you'll be fine.  

'''Example'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printInt(int printable){
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The int you passed in has value &quot; &lt;&lt; printable &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
int main(){
  int my_array[5];
  
  // Reminder: always initialize your array values!
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
    my_array[i] = i * 2;
  
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
    printInt(my_array[i]); // &lt;-- We pass in a dereferenced array element
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs the following:

 The int you passed in has value 0
 The int you passed in has value 2
 The int you passed in has value 4
 The int you passed in has value 6
 The int you passed in has value 8

This passes array elements just like normal integers, because array elements like &lt;tt&gt;my_array[2]&lt;/tt&gt; are integers.

;Passing a whole array

Well, we can pass single array elements into a function.  But what if we want to pass a whole array?  We can not do that directly, but you can treat the array as a pointer.

'''Example'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void printIntArr(int *array_arg, int array_len){
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The length of the array is &quot; &lt;&lt; array_len &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; array_len; i++)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Array[&quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; &quot;] = &quot; &lt;&lt; array_arg[i] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
 
int main(){
  int my_array[5];

  // Reminder: always initialize your array values!
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
    my_array[i] = i * 2;
  
  printIntArr(my_array, 5);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|note=
Due to array-pointer interchangeability ''in the context of parameter declarations only'', we can also declare pointers as arrays in function parameter lists.  It is treated identically.  For example, the first line of the function above can also be written as

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;void printIntArr(int array_arg[], int array_len)&lt;/source&gt;

It is important to note that even if it is written as &lt;tt&gt;int array_arg[]&lt;/tt&gt;, the parameter is still a pointer of type '''int *'''.  It is not an array; an array passed to the function will still be automatically converted to a pointer to its first element.
}}

This will output the following:

 The length of the array is 5
 Array[0] = 0
 Array[1] = 2
 Array[2] = 4
 Array[3] = 6
 Array[4] = 8

As you can see, the array in main is accessed by a pointer.  Now here's some important points to realize:
*Once you pass an array to a function, it is converted to a pointer so that function has no idea how to guess the length of the array.  Unless you always use arrays that are the same size, you should always pass in the array length along with the array. 
*You've passed in a POINTER.   &lt;tt&gt;my_array&lt;/tt&gt; is an array, not a pointer.  If you change &lt;tt&gt;array_arg&lt;/tt&gt; within the function, &lt;tt&gt;my_array&lt;/tt&gt; does not change (i.e., if you set &lt;tt&gt;array_arg&lt;/tt&gt; to point to a new array).  But if you change any element of &lt;tt&gt;array_arg&lt;/tt&gt;, you're changing the memory space pointed to by &lt;tt&gt;array_arg&lt;/tt&gt;, which is the array &lt;tt&gt;my_array&lt;/tt&gt;.  

{{TODO|Passing a single element (by value vs. by reference), passing the whole array (always by reference), passing as '''const'''|C++ Programming}}

==== by reference ====
The same concept of references is used when passing variables. 

'''Example'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void foo( int &amp;i )
{
  ++i;
}
 
int main()
{
  int bar = 5;   // bar == 5
  foo( bar );    // bar == 6
  foo( bar );    // bar == 7
 
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
        
Here we display one of the two common uses of references in function arguments -- they allow us to use the conventional syntax of passing an argument by value but manipulate the value in the caller.

{{NOTE|note=If the parameter is a non-const reference, the caller expects it to be modified. If the function does not want to modify the parameter, a const reference should be used instead.}}

However there is a more common use of references in function arguments -- they can also be used to pass a handle to a large data structure without making multiple copies of it in the process. Consider the following:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void foo( const std::string &amp; s ) // const reference, explained below
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

void bar( std::string s )
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main()
{
  std::string const text = &quot;This is a test.&quot;;

  foo( text ); // doesn't make a copy of &quot;text&quot;
  bar( text ); // makes a copy of &quot;text&quot;

  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
        
In this simple example we're able to see the differences in pass by value and pass by reference. In this case pass by value just expends a few additional bytes, but imagine for instance if &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; contained the text of an entire book.

The reason why we use a constant reference instead of a reference is the user of this function can assure that the value of the variable passed does not change within the function. We technically call this &quot;const-to-reference&quot;.

The ability to pass it by reference keeps us from needing to make a copy of the string and avoids the ugliness of using a pointer.

{{NOTE|note=
It should also be noted that &quot;const-to-reference&quot; only makes sense for complex types -- classes and structs. In the case of ordinal types -- i.e. '''int''', '''float''', '''bool''', etc. -- there is no savings in using a reference instead of simply using pass by value, and indeed the extra costs associated with indirection may make code using a reference slower than code that copies small objects.
}}

;Passing an array of fixed-length by using reference
In some case, a function requires an array of a specific length to work:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void func(int(&amp;para)[4]);
&lt;/source&gt;
Unlike the case of array changed into pointer above, the parameter is not a PLAIN array that can be changed into a pointer, but rather a reference to array with 4 &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s. Therefore, only array of 4 &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s, not array of any other length, not pointer to int, can be passed into this function. This helps you prevent buffer overflow errors because the array object is ALWAYS allocated unless you circumvent the type system by casting.

It can be used to pass an array without specifying the number of elements manually:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
template&lt;int n&gt;void func(int(&amp;para)[n]);
&lt;/source&gt;
The compiler generates the value of length at compile time, inside the function, n stores the number of elements. However, the use of template generates code bloat.

In C++, a multi-dimensional array cannot be converted to a multi-level pointer, therefore, the code below is invalid:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// WRONG
void foo(int**matrix,int n,int m);
int main(){
	int data[10][5];
	// do something on data
	foo(data,10,5);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Although an int[10][5] can be converted to an (*int)[5], it cannot be converted to int**. Therefore you may need to hard-code the array bound in the function declaration:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// BAD
void foo(int(*matrix)[5],int n,int m);
int main(){
	int data[10][5];
	// do something on data
	foo(data,10,5);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
To make the function more generic, templates and function overloading should be used:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// GOOD
template&lt;int junk,int rubbish&gt;void foo(int(&amp;matrix)[junk][rubbish],int n,int m);
void foo(int**matrix,int n,int m);
int main(){
	int data[10][5];
	// do something on data
	foo(data,10,5);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The reason for having n and m in the first version is mainly for consistency, and also deal with the case that the array allocated is not used completely. It may also be used for checking buffer overflows by comparing n/m with junk/rubbish.

==== by value ====
When we want to write a function which the value of the argument is independent to the passed variable, we use pass-by-value approach.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int add(int num1, int num2)
{
 num1 += num2; // change of value of &quot;num1&quot;
 return num1;
}

int main()
{
 int a = 10, b = 20, ans;
 ans = add(a, b);
 std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; &quot; + &quot; &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; &quot; = &quot; &lt;&lt; ans &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
 10 + 20 = 30

The above example shows a property of pass-by-value, the arguments are copies of the passed variable and only in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope|scope]] of the corresponding function. This means that we have to afford the cost of copying. However, this cost is usually considered only for larger and more complex variables.&lt;br&gt;
In this case, the values of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are copied to &quot;num1&quot; and &quot;num2&quot; on the function &quot;add()&quot;. We can see that the value of &quot;num1&quot; is changed in line 3. However, we can also observe that the value of &quot;a&quot; is kept after passed to this function.

==== Constant Parameters ====
The keyword &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; can also be used as a guarantee that a function will not modify a value that is passed in. This is really only useful for references and pointers (and not things passed by value), though there's nothing syntactically to prevent the use of &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; for arguments passed by value.

Take for example the following functions:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void foo(const std::string &amp;s)
{
 s.append(&quot;blah&quot;); // ERROR -- we can't modify the string
 
 std::cout &lt;&lt; s.length() &lt;&lt; std::endl; // fine
}
 
void bar(const Widget *w)
{
 w-&gt;rotate(); // ERROR - rotate wouldn't be const
 
 std::cout &lt;&lt; w-&gt;name() &lt;&lt; std::endl; // fine
}
&lt;/source&gt;
        
In the first example we tried to call a non-const method -- &lt;tt&gt;append()&lt;/tt&gt; -- on an argument passed as a &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; reference, thus breaking our agreement with the caller not to modify it and the compiler will give us an error.

The same is true with &lt;tt&gt;rotate()&lt;/tt&gt;, but with a &lt;tt&gt;const&lt;/tt&gt; pointer in the second example.

==== Default values ====
Parameters in C++ functions (including member functions and constructors) can be declared with default values, like this
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int foo (int a, int b = 5, int c = 3);
&lt;/source&gt;

Then if the function is called with fewer arguments (but enough to specify the arguments without default values), the compiler will assume the default values for the missing arguments at the end. For example, if I call
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
foo(6, 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

that will be equivalent to calling
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
foo(6, 1, 3)
&lt;/source&gt;
In many situations, this saves you from having to define two separate functions that take different numbers of parameters, which are almost identical except for a default value.

The &quot;value&quot; that is given as the default value is often a constant, but may be any valid expression, including a function call that performs arbitrary computation.

Default values can only be given for the last arguments; i.e. you cannot give a default value for a parameter that is followed by a parameter that does not have a default value, since it will never be used.

Once you define the default value for a parameter in a function declaration, you cannot re-define a default value for the same parameter in a later declaration, even if it is the same value.

==== Ellipsis (...) as a parameter ====
If the parameter list ends with an ellipsis, it means that the arguments number must be equal or greater than the number of parameters specified. It will in fact create a variadic function, a function of variable arity; that is, one which can take different numbers of arguments.

{{TODO|Mention printf, &lt;cstdarg&gt; and check declaration|C++ Programming}}


{{NOTE|
The variadic function feature is going to be readdressed in the upcoming C++ language standard, C++0x; with the possible inclusion of variatic macros and the ability to create variadic template classes and variadic template functions. Variadic templates will finally allow the creation of true tuple classes in C++.}}

=== Composition ===
Just as with mathematical functions, C++ functions can be composed, meaning that you use one expression as part of another. For example, you can use any expression as an argument to a function:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;double x = cos (angle + pi/2);&lt;/source&gt; 

This statement takes the value of pi, divides it by two and adds the result to the value of angle. The sum is then passed as an argument to the cos function.

You can also take the result of one function and pass it as an argument to another:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;double x = exp (log (10.0));&lt;/source&gt;  

This statement finds the log base e of 10 and then raises e to that power. The result gets assigned to x; I hope you know what it is.

=== Recursion ===
In programming languages, [[w:Recursion|recursion]] was first implemented in [[Programming:Lisp|Lisp]] on the basis of a mathematical concept that existed earlier on, it is a concept that allows us to break down a problem into one or more subproblems that are similar in form to the original problem, in this case, of having a function call itself in some circumstances. It is generally distinguished from [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Flow Control#Loops (iterations)|iterators or loops]].

A simple example of a recursive function is:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
  void func(){
     func();
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

It should be noted that non-terminating recursive functions as shown above are almost never used in programs (indeed, some definitions of recursion would exclude such non-terminating definitions). A terminating condition is used to prevent infinite recursion.

; Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
  double power(double x, int n)
  {
   if (n &lt; 0)
   {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl
                &lt;&lt; &quot;Negative index, program terminated.&quot;;
      exit(1);
   }
   if (n)
      return x * power(x, n-1);
   else
      return 1.0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

The above function can be called like this:
  
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
  x = power(x, static_cast&lt;int&gt;(power(2.0, 2)));
&lt;/source&gt;

Why is recursion useful? Although, theoretically, anything possible by recursion is also possible by iteration (that is, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;), it is sometimes much more convenient to use recursion. Recursive code happens to be much easier to follow as in the example below. The problem with recursive code is that it takes too much memory. Since the function is called many times, without the data from the calling function removed, memory requirements increase significantly. But often the simplicity and elegance of recursive code overrules the memory requirements.

The classic example of recursion is the factorial:
&lt;math&gt;n!=(n-1)!n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;0!=1&lt;/math&gt; by convention. In recursion, this function can be succinctly defined as
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 unsigned factorial(unsigned n)
 {
   if (n != 0) 
   {
     return n * factorial(n-1);
   } 
   else 
   {
     return 1;
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

With iteration, the logic is harder to see:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 unsigned factorial2(unsigned n)
 {
   int a = 1;
   while(n &gt; 0)
   {
     a = a*n;
     n = n-1;
   }
   return a;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Although recursion tends to be slightly slower than iteration, it should be used where using iteration would yield long, difficult-to-understand code. Also, keep in mind that recursive functions take up additional memory (on the stack) for each level. Thus they can run out of memory where an iterative approach may just use constant memory.

Each recursive function needs to have a '''Base Case'''. A base case is where the recursive function stops calling itself and returns a value. The value returned is (hopefully) the  desired value.

For the previous example, 
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 unsigned factorial(unsigned n)
 {
   if(n != 0) 
   {
     return n * factorial(n-1);
   } 
   else
   {
     return 1;
   }
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

the base case is reached when &lt;math&gt;n=0&lt;/math&gt;. In this example, the base case is everything contained in the else statement (which happens to return the number 1). The overall value that is returned is every value from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; multiplied together. So, suppose we call the function and pass it the value &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;. The function then does the math &lt;math&gt;3*2*1=6&lt;/math&gt; and returns 6 as the result of calling factorial(3).

Another classic example of recursion is the sequence of Fibonacci numbers:

 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ...

The zeroth element of the sequence is 0. The next element is 1. Any other number of this series is the sum of the two elements coming before it. As an exercise, write a function that returns the ''n''th Fibonacci number using recursion.

=== main ===
The function &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; also happens to be the ''entry point'' of any (standard-compliant) C++ program and must be defined. The compiler arranges for the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function to be called when the program begins execution.  &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; may ''call'' other functions which may call yet other functions.

{{NOTE|note=&lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; also special because the user code is not allowed to call it; in particular, it cannot be directly or indirectly recursive.  This is one of the many small ways in which C++ differs from C. }}

The &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function returns an integer value. In certain systems, this value is interpreted as a success/failure code.  The return value of zero signifies a successful completion of the program.  Any non-zero value is considered a failure. Unlike other functions, if control reaches the end of &lt;tt&gt;main()&lt;/tt&gt;, an implicit &lt;code&gt;return 0;&lt;/code&gt; for success is automatically added.  To make return values from &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; more readable, the header file &lt;tt&gt;cstdlib&lt;/tt&gt; defines the constants &lt;tt&gt;EXIT_SUCCESS&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;EXIT_FAILURE&lt;/tt&gt; (to indicate successful/unsuccessful completion respectively).

{{NOTE|The ISO C++ Standard (ISO/IEC 14882:1998) specifically requires main to have a return type of &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;. But the ISO C Standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1999) actually does not, though most compilers treat this as a minor warning-level error.

The explicit use of &lt;code&gt;return 0;&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;return EXIT_SUCCESS;&lt;/code&gt;) to exit the main function is left to the '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions#Explicitness or Implicitness|coding style]]''''' used. }}

The main function can also be declared like this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv){
  // code
}
&lt;/source&gt;

which defines the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function as returning an integer value '''int''' and taking two parameters. The first parameter of the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function, '''argc''', is an integer value '''int''' that specifies the number of arguments passed to the program, while the second, '''argv''', is an array of strings containing the actual arguments. There is almost always at least one argument passed to a program; the name of the program itself is the first argument, &lt;tt&gt;argv[0]&lt;/tt&gt;. Other arguments may be passed from the system.  

'''Example'''
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv){
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Number of arguments: &quot; &lt;&lt; argc &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  for(size_t i = 0; i &lt; argc; i++)
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;  Argument &quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; &quot; = '&quot; &lt;&lt; argv[i] &lt;&lt; &quot;'&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{NOTE|'''size_t''' is the return type of {{C++ Programming/kw|sizeof}} function. '''size_t''' is a '''typedef''' for some {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} type and is often defined as {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} '''int''' or {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} '''long''' but not always.}}

If the program above is compiled into the executable &lt;tt&gt;arguments&lt;/tt&gt; and executed from the command line like this in *nix:

 $ ./arguments I love chocolate cake

Or in Command Prompt in Windows or MS-DOS:

 C:\&gt;arguments I love chocolate cake

It will output the following (but note that argument 0 may not be quite the same as this -- it might include a full path, or it might include the program name only, or it might include a relative path, or it might even be empty):

 Number of arguments: 5
   Argument 0 = './arguments'
   Argument 1 = 'I'
   Argument 2 = 'love'
   Argument 3 = 'chocolate'
   Argument 4 = 'cake'

You can see that the command line arguments of the program are stored into the &lt;tt&gt;argv&lt;/tt&gt; array, and that &lt;tt&gt;argc&lt;/tt&gt; contains the length of that array.  This allows you to change the behavior of a program based on the command line arguments passed to it.

{{NOTE|note='''argv''' is a (pointer to the first element of an) array of strings.  As such, it can be written as &lt;tt&gt;char **argv&lt;/tt&gt; or as &lt;tt&gt;char *argv[]&lt;/tt&gt;.  However, &lt;tt&gt;char argv[][]&lt;/tt&gt; is not allowed.  Read up on C++ arrays for the exact reasons for this.

Also, '''argc''' and '''argv''' are the two most common names for the two arguments given to the &lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt; function.  You can think them to stand for &quot;arguments count&quot; and &quot;arguments variables&quot; respectively. They can, however, be changed if you'd like.  The following code is just as legal:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int main(int foo, char **bar){
  // code
}
&lt;/source&gt;

However, any other programmer that sees your code might get mad at you if you code like that.

From the example above, we can also see that C++ do not really care about what the variables' names are (of course, you cannot use reserved words as names) but their types.

{{:C++ Programming/Operators/Pointers/To Functions}}

=== Callback ===
In [[w:computer programming|computer programming]], a '''callback''' is [[w:executable code|executable code]] that is passed as an [[w:argument (computer science)|argument]] to other code. It allows a lower-level [[w:abstraction layer|abstaraction layer]] to call a [[w:subroutine|function]] defined in a higher-level layer. A callback is often back on the level of the original caller.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Callback-notitle.svg||400px|A callback is often back on the level of the original caller.]]&lt;/center&gt; 

Usually, the higher-level code starts by calling a function within the lower-level code, passing to it a [[w:pointer|pointer]] or [[w:smart pointer|handle]] to another function.  While the lower-level function executes, it may call the passed-in function any number of times to perform some subtask. In another scenario, the lower-level function registers the passed-in function as a ''handler'' that is to be called asynchronously by the lower-level at a later time in reaction to something.

A callback can be used as a simpler alternative to [[w:polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] and [[w:generic programming|generic programming]], in that the exact behavior of a function can be dynamically determined by passing different (yet compatible) function pointers or handles to the lower-level function. This can be a very powerful technique for [[w:code reuse|code reuse]]. In another common scenario, the callback is first registered and later called asynchronously.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Callback-async-notitle.svg||In another common scenario, the callback is first registered and later called asynchronously.]]&lt;/center&gt;
{{TODO| Add missing, redirect links info and add examples...|C++ Programming}}

=== Overloading ===
Function overloading is the use of a single name for several different functions in the same scope. Multiple functions who share the same name must be differentiated by using another set of parameters for every such function. The functions can be different in the number of parameters they expect, or their parameters can differ in type. This way, the compiler can figure out the exact function to call by looking at the arguments the caller supplied. This is called overload resolution, and is quite complex.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Overloading Example

// (1)
double geometric_mean( int, int );
 
// (2)
double geometric_mean( double, double );
 
// (3)
double geometric_mean( double, double, double );
 
// ...
 
// Will call (1):
geometric_mean( 10, 25 );
// Will call (2):
geometric_mean( 22.1, 421.77 );
// Will call (3):
geometric_mean( 11.1, 0.4, 2.224 );
&lt;/source&gt;

Under some circumstances, a call can be ambiguous, because two or more functions
match with the supplied arguments equally well.

Example, supposing the declaration of geometric_mean above:
 // This is an error, because (1) could be called and the second
 // argument casted to an int, and (2) could be called with the first
 // argument casted to a double. None of the two functions is
 // unambiguously a better match.
 geometric_mean(7, 13.21);
 // This will call (3) too, despite its last argument being an int,
 // Because (3) is the only function which can be called with 3
 // arguments
 geometric_mean(1.1, 2.2, 3);

Templates and non-templates can be overloaded. A non-template function takes
precedence over a template, if both forms of the function match the supplied
arguments equally well.

Note that you can overload many operators in C++ too.

==== Overloading resolution ====
Please beware that overload resolution in C++ is one of the most complicated parts of the language. This is probably unavoidable in any case with automatic template instantiation, user defined implicit conversions, built-in implicit conversation and more as language features. So do not despair if you do not understand this at first go. It is really quite natural, once you have the ideas, but written down it seems extremely complicated.

{{TODO|*This section does not cover the selection of constructors because, well, that's even worse. Namespaces are also not considered below.
*Feel free to add the missing information, possibly as another chapter.
|C++ Programming}}

The easiest way to understand overloading is to imagine that the compiler first finds every function which might possibly be called, using any legal conversions and template instantiations. The compiler then selects the best match, if any, from this set. Specifically, the set is constructed like this:
* All functions with matching name, including function templates, are put into the set. Return types and visibility are not considered. Templates are added with as closely matching parameters as possible. Member functions are considered functions with the first parameter being a pointer-to-class-type.
* Conversion functions are added as so-called surrogate functions, with two parameters, the first being the class type and the second the return type.
* All functions that do not match the number of parameters, even after considering defaulted parameters and ellipses, are removed from the set.
* For each function, each argument is considered to see if a legal conversion sequence exists to convert the caller's argument to the function's parameters. If no such conversion sequence can be found, the function is removed from the set.

The legal conversions are detailed below, but in short a legal conversion is any number of built-in (like int to float) conversions combined with &lt;em&gt;at most one user defined conversion&lt;/em&gt;. The last part is critical to understand if you are writing replacements to built-in types, such as smart pointers. User defined conversions are described above, but to summarize it is 
# implicit conversion operators like &lt;tt&gt;operator short toShort();&lt;/tt&gt;
# One argument constructors (If a constructor has all but one parameter defaulted, it is considered one-argument)

The overloading resolution works by attempting to establish the best matching function. 

;'''Easy conversions are preferred''':
Looking at one parameter, the preferred conversion is roughly based on scope of the conversion. Specifically, the conversions are preferred in this order, with most-preferred highest:
# No conversion, adding one or more '''const''', adding reference, convert array to pointer to first member
## '''const''' are preferred for rvalues (roughly constants) while non-const are preferred for lvalues (roughly assignables)
# Conversion from short integral types ('''bool''', '''char''', '''short''') to '''int''', and '''float''' to '''double'''.
# Built-in conversions, such as between int and double and pointer type conversion. Pointer conversion are ranked as
## Base to derived (pointers) or derived to base (for pointers-to-members), with most-derived preferred
## Conversion to &lt;tt&gt;void*&lt;/tt&gt;
## Conversion to '''bool'''
# User-defined conversions, see above. 
# Match with ellipses. (As an aside, this is rather useful knowledge for template meta programming)

The best match is now determined according to the following rules:

;*'''A function is only a better match if all parameters match at least as well'''
In short, the function must be better in every respect --- if one parameter matches better and another worse, neither function is considered a better match. If no function in the set is a better match than both, the call is ambiguous (i.e., it fails)
Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void foo(void*, bool);
void foo(int*, int);
 
int main() {
 int a;
 foo(&amp;a, true); // ambiguous 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

;*'''Non-templates are preferred over templates'''
If all else is equal between two functions, but one is a template and the other not, the non-template is preferred. This seldom causes surprises.

;*'''Most-specialized template is preferred'''
When all else is equal between two template function, but one is more specialized than the other, the most specialized version is preferred. 
Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
template&lt;typename T&gt; void foo(T);  //1
template&lt;typename T&gt; void foo(T*); //2
 
int main() {
 int a;
 foo(&amp;a); // Calls 2, since 2 is more specialized.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Which template is more specialized is an entire chapter unto itself.

;*'''Return types are ignored'''
This rule is mentioned above, but it bears repeating: Return types are &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; part of overload resolutions, even if the function selected has a return type that will cause the compilation to fail.
Example:
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void foo(int);
int foo(float);
 
int main() { 
 // This will fail since foo(int) is best match, and void cannot be converted to int.
 return foo(5); 
}
&lt;/source&gt;

;*'''The selected function may not be accessible'''
If the selected best function is not accessible (e.g., it is a private function and the call it not from a member or friend of its class), the call fails.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:PIA00040 Umbrielx2.47.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Umbriel as seen from Voyager 2]]
Umbriel is a moon of Uranus

==How big is Umbriel?==
Umbriel is about 1169.4 km wide, or about 1/10th as wide as Earth.

==What is its surface like?==
The only close-up images we have of Umbriel's surface come from ''Voyager 2'''s flyby in January 1986.
These images show that Umbriel has a dark surface, the darkest of any of Uranus' moons. Near the equator lies Wunda, a large ring of bright material. Wunda is assumed to be a crater, but nobody is sure what it is exactly. Near Wunda is the crater Skynd.

==How long is a day on Umbriel?==
One day on Umbriel is equal to about four Earth days.

==How long is its orbit around Uranus?==
One orbit around Uranus is also equal to about four Earth days.

==What is it made of?==
Umbriel is made mostly of water ice, followed by silicate rock and methane ice. Most of its methane ice is on its surface.

From guessing based on its mass and size, scientists have worked out that it is about 60% ice and 40% rock.

==How would Umbriel's gravity pull on me?==
If you stood on Umbriel, you would weigh about a fifth (0.23) of what you do on Earth. Someone who weighs 100 lbs on Earth would weigh only 23 lbs on Umbriel, about the weight of a dog.

==Who is it named after?==
Umbriel is named after the &quot;dusky melancholy sprite&quot; in Alexander Pope's ''The Rape of the Lock'', and the name suggests the Latin ''umbra'', meaning shadow.&lt;!--''Umbra'' is also in words like ''umbrella''  (SHOULD THIS BE ADDED?)--&gt; 

==How was it discovered?==
Umbriel was discovered on October 24, 1851 by William Lassell. He also discovered the moon Ariel at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Picture Issue==

I don't know what picture you are referring as untagged. In the book Semiconductor Electronics I have loaded pictures that have been produced by my employees and I pay them. So I own it and have released it under GFDL so that all would benefit. Could you please specify the file names so that I can tag it, in case I have missed it by chance? [[User : A.K.Karthikeyan]]

== Move tab ==

To move a badly named page to a correct location, such as from &quot;Spanish/Exercise Telling Time&quot; to &quot;[[Spanish/Exercises/Telling Time]]&quot;, you can use the &quot;move&quot; tab at the top of each page (next to the history tab), instead of copying the page. This preserves the history of all old versions of this page. (Because &quot;move&quot; also leaves a redirect at the old location, some users nominate the redirect for deletion.) Generally doing a &quot;move&quot; is a better idea than copying a page. The &quot;move&quot; feature is somewhat unique to [[MW:MediaWiki|MediaWiki]], and does not seem to exist in most other wiki software, but Wikibookians have used it [[Special:Log/move|many times]].

You do not need to know all wiki features to use a wiki, so I hope that you continue contributing to Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:02, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

== Column hint and suggestion ==

You can create columns using wikitables. See [[Help:Table]]. This is the basic syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
{| width=&quot;500px&quot;
| Column one, row one || Column two, row one || Column three, row row one
|-
| Column one, row two ||  || Column two, row three
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which makes:
{| width=&quot;500px&quot;
| Column one, row one || Column two, row one || Column three, row row one
|-
| Column one, row two ||  || Column two, row three
|}

Also consider using &amp;#123;{[[Template:hidden|hidden]]}} to display solutions instead of separate pages. Good luck on your book, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 20:11, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

== Indonesian wikibook ==

Hi thinkfast, I'm reorganizing [[Indonesian]] to follow [[French]] wikibook structure... hope you could help too.. [[User:Chaerani|Chaerani]] 14:20, 30 September 2006 (UTC)

== Moving pages  ==

I've just found that you've gone through some of [[Puzzles]] moving pages to conform to a &quot;naming convention&quot;.

Before you do any more of this, either to Puzzles or to any other wikibook, please:
# Look on the talk page of the book's main page to check that there isn't already a naming convention being discussed and/or implemented for the book, with which the one you are about to implement may conflict.  If you wish to propose your convention as a better alternative, by all means propose it, and give people time to comment before you implement it.
# Be sure to think about how the pages are named, rather than blindly copying the existing names (and thereby perpetuating such problems as miscapitalisation or needless repetition of the same word).
-- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 09:55, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

== Speedy on myers briggs ==
Just to say I've removed it - it is a perfectly valid redirect to a page with considerable content.  If someone was using the old naming strategy they would get there ok - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:12, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

== You've been thinking ''too'' fast ==

I only just noticed some of the links you changed on [[Talk:Puzzles]] about a month ago.  In doing so, you altered what I wrote.  Those were the days - I proposed a naming scheme whereby the hierarchy levels are delimited by colons.  But you changed my proposal to use slashes.  Please be a little more careful if you're going to do any more updates of this kind.

Please also read [[Talk:Puzzles#Recent attempts]] if you haven't already.  I agree that using slashes is the way to go ''now'' that it has been decreed as the standard.  But we still need to come to an agreement on capitalisation before we continue. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 18:40, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

== Pictures ==

You write:

*As you can see at the top of this page, &quot;All unlicensed images uploaded to wikibooks before November 1, 2006 will soon be deleted.&quot;  You have uploaded images and some of them are untagged. You can see them [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/UntaggedImages.php?wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;wikilang=en&amp;order=img_user_text&amp;max=500&amp;img_user_text=AlbertCahalan&amp;grouped= here].  Please review them and add appropriate tags.  If you have any questions, feel free to [[User talk:Think Fast|ask me]].  --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 04:29, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

Well now. I'll do my best to remain polite, but you're pushing my limit here. I have no idea why you took it upon yourself to destroy things for no good reason. I may have left a tag off an image on occasion, though I doubt it. I'm usually pretty good about marking my images as public domain. Actually, public domain '''is''' unlicensed; in fact it '''can not be licensed''' because it has '''no''' copyright. Most are works of US federal government employees done while performing their jobs; nearly all of the rest are my personal creations.

So, what have you destroyed while I've been away from the wiki? Sorry, real life intrudes at times. I have 5 kids and I've been working 70-hour to 80-hour weeks lately.

BTW, [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/UntaggedImages.php?wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;wikilang=en&amp;order=img_user_text&amp;max=500&amp;img_user_text=AlbertCahalan&amp;grouped= your link] is worthless. I get &quot;500 Internal Error&quot; and &quot;The toolserver is ill today.&quot;. I also don't &quot;see at the top of this page&quot; anything related to image deletion whatsoever.

Something to think about: I at least made it back to the wiki. Some folks disappear for good. Some folks are actually dead. It's quite unreasonable to expect all contributers to always be able to quickly respond to a demand, especially when that demand is rather pointless. (Was there a cease-and-desist or a DMCA takedown notice, or even a valid reason to suspect that something wasn't right?) I think you'll find that the much-hated DMCA actually protects the wiki from copyright problems caused by badly behaved users.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 08:33, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

==Spanish wikibook==

Check out my new vocabulary page at [[Spanish/Vocabulary/People]]. What do you think of structuring the vocabulary pages this way? [[User:Cilantrohead|Cilantrohead]] ([[User talk:Cilantrohead|talk]]) 00:40, 2 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:North American cuisines|North American Cuisines]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ontario|Cuisine of Ontario]]

'''Maple Beans''' is a modification of the standard [[Cookbook:Baked Beans | Baked Beans]] made throughout much of Europe and North America.  This variant is common through south and central Quebec as well as most of Ontario and can be purchased in cans across Canada.

==Ingredients==

* 2 L (8 cups) water
* 625 mL (2 1/2 cups) small dried white beans
* 1 large sweet onion
* 250 mL (1 cup) maple syrup
* 30 mL (2 Tbsp.) dark brown sugar
* 30 mL (2 Tbsp.) butter
* 2 mL (1/2 tsp.) dry mustard
* 5 mL (1/2 tsp.) ground pepper
* 5 mL (1 tsp.) salt
* 6 slices side bacon
'''or'''
* 60 mL (1/4 cup) of bacon runoff

==Procedure==

# Wash beans and place in a saucepan with the water.  Cover and bring to a boil, check regularly.
# When water has reached the boiling point, time for 5 minutes and remove from heat.  Let sit for 1 hour, covered.
# After the hour, return beans and water to heat and bring to a simmer, still covered. Simmer for 45 minutes.
# Strain beans and water through a colander, collecting the liquids for later use in a bowl.
# Finely dice the sweet onion and in a bowl mix with the salt, mustard and maple syrup.  Add 625 mL (2 1/2 cups) of the aforementioned bean-water to the mix and blend well.
# Finely slice the bacon, place in roast pan/casserole dish and cover with the beans pour the liquid mixture over the beans.
# Cover and bake for 3 hours at 165°C (325°F), adding 125 mL (1/2 cup) of bean-water at the 2 1/2 hour mark.
# Melt butter and combine with brown sugar.  Pour over the baked beans and bake, uncovered, until liquid is no longer visible.

==Notes, tips, and variations==

* You can substitute honey for the maple syrup, or molasses, maple is used for it's flavouring as much as its sweetness.
* Margarine or vegetable oil will do as well as butter for this, butter was used traditionally and is thus listed.
* This is often served with [[Cookbook:Ham | Ham]] and [[Cookbook:Sweet Cornbread | Sweet Cornbread]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Indices and surds??  Why is the obsolete jargon being used?  Surds doesn't even cover all the issues related to matters of roots and powers.  I'm all for having a uniform vocabulary across the globe.  I couldn't even find any discussion of this choice.  In the U.S., which I fully understand is just one country, indices are usually taken to me subscripts used to differentiate elements of an array.  I hope that you folks would discuss this and think it through. It was disturbing enough to cause me to create and account. [[User:Begs|Begs]] 21:15, 23 June 2006 (UTC)


==Syllabus anyone?==

Hi, i  think we should discuss why were are not sticking to the OCR syllabus like it clearly states on the first page of this book... I mean, differentiation belongs here, and not C2. Clearly stated in the syllabus, page 32... Hmm, I dont understand why we just can't stick to it, and make it less confusing for everyone ! --[[User:Mitchc|Mitchc]] 08:55, 28 August 2005 (UTC) (thoughts and comments welcome)

See [[User_talk:Krackpipe|my talk page]], i discussed it with Mattrix. Basically, I was working from the MEI version of the specification which has a minor difference in its name but big differences to the actual content. Sorry, it was a mistake on my part, all I saw was OCR and Mathematics and mixed the two up. Move everything where you feel they should go.  --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 13:54, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

Recently, a section link was added for &quot;Principles of mathematical analysis&quot;.  I'm not sure what this should cover, as unlike most of the other sections list, it doesn't appear to correspond to a heading in the syllabus.  Thus, I'm not sure if this should be included here or not.  I say most, as Equations, and Error bounds and Inequalities don't.  However, equations appears to serve as a basis for the Polynomials section, and the Syllabus does mention inequalities as part of their Polynomials heading.  That still leaves the error bounds bit, which doesn't appear to be part of the C1 Syllabus, although  it may be part of another module.  

Basically, I'm asking Principles of mathematics analysis belongs here, and what content it should include if it doesn, and whether the error bounds content belongs here, or in another module. [[User:Silverfish|Silverfish]] 18:21, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

:Principles of mathematical analysis seems to have just been randomly made up, it isn't on the syllabus, so I've removed it. [[User:Aleksev|Aleksev]] 00:28, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== Completed? ==

Is everyone happy that this module is completed to a {{stage short|100%}} level?
:No, [[A-level_Mathematics/C1/Polynomials#Curves_of_polynomials]] needs pictures of the general shapes of curves, two under the paragraph

::&quot;If the coefficient of x^n is positive, curves with an even value of n will have a bucket shape, and curves with an odd value of n will generally be negative when x is negative, and positive when x is positive (like y = x).&quot;

:and another two under the paragraph

::&quot;If the coefficient of x^n is negative, curves with an even value of n will have an upside down bucket shape, and curves with an odd value of n will generally be positive when x is negative, and negative when x is positive (similar to y = − x).&quot;

:and the page [[A-level_Mathematics/C1/Coordinate_Geometry_and_Graphs#Curves]] needs images of general curve shapes where i had previously just written &quot;(images here)&quot; or something similar. I think they are essential to demonstrate how the shape of curves change when certain numbers are modified. I would have done them myself but my skills in inkscape/illustrator aren't too great, even after a few tries. I'll take a look at the whole module myself now and check the text itself, but I definately remember leaving out those pictures.--[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 21:02, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

==Differentiation IS NOT C1 ==

Sorry but differentiation has no place here. the differentiation refered to on page 32 of the OCR syllabus[http://www.ocr.org.uk/Data/publications/specifications_syllabuses_and_tutors_handbooks/AS_A_Level4258311.pdf]  is actually how the exam board differentiate between pupils abilities. If you read the C1 specific syllabus starting at page 37 you will find that differentiation is NOT C1

# [[A-level Mathematics/C1/Differentiation|Differentiation]] {{stage short|100%}}

ive done C1, and its in there.


C1 definitely does not have differentiation on the OCR syllabus, as it is part of the C2 module

== Microscopy ==

''' Different types of microscope '''

There are two types of microscope - light &amp; electron. Light uses light waves as it's source of radiation and electron microscopes use electrons. This has to do with the wavelength of the radiation - visible light ranges from 400-700nm, and for the light microscope to see a structure, that structure has to be greater than half the wavelength used, so as to interfere with the light waves and produce an image. This means the maximum resolution of a light microscope is around 200nm.

Electrons have a much smaller wavelength (at least as small as x-rays) and because they are negatively charged, they can be focused using electromagnets, whereas x-rays cannot). This allows them to see much smaller structures than light microscopes - up to and including 0.5nm, and a single DNA molecule is 2nm. Electron microscopes however do have a drawback - the specimen must be scanned in a vacuum, and since water boils at room temperature in a vacuum, all specimens must be dehydrated before being examined, and thus only dead material can be seen.


''' Magnification and Resolution '''

Optical magnification is defined as the ratio between the apparent size of an object (or its size in an image) and its actual size. It can be calculated as thus; 

&lt;math&gt;magnification = \frac{size-of-image}{actual-size-of-specimen}&lt;/math&gt;

Resolution on the other hand, is defined as the ability to distinguish between two separate points. If the light microscope cannot distinguish between the two separate points, those two points become one in the resulting image. For example, ribosomes are approximately 22nm in diameter and when viewed with a light microscope cannot be discerned as it does not interfere with the light waves, whereas a 1000nm mitochondrion does.

== Cell Organelles ==

An organelle is defined as both a functionally and structurally separate part of the cell and are often surrounded by membranes of their own. This is known as compartmentalisation. 

===Nucleus ===

Structure

*Largest organelle 
*Dual-membrane (nuclear envelope) - porous, allowing exchange between nucleus and cell. 
*Sub-structure - nucleolus

Function
*Controls cells activities
*mRNA leaves the nucleus to perform protein synthesis
*Contains chromosomes

[[File:Cell parts.png|thumb|right|The parts of a cell nucleus]]

===Mitochondria===

Structure

*dual membrane forming an envelope
*Inner membrane folded to form cristae, projecting to the inside of the mitochondria, known as the matrix

Function

*Perform later stages of aerobic respiration, a metabolic process that creates ATP
*Also involved in lipid synthesis

[[File:Animal mitochondrion diagram en.svg|thumb|right|The diagram shows a section of a eukaryotic cell's mitochondrion.]]

===Endoplasmic Reticulum===

Structure-.

*Rough endoplasmic reticulum has its membrane surface lined with ribosomes.
*Smooth endoplasmic reticulum do not have ribosomes
*Both form a series of sheets which enclose flattened sacs called a cisternae.

Function:

*Protein synthesis takes place in ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum
*Provide a large surface area for chemical reactions and a pathway for transport of materials through the cell
*Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is involved in lipid synthesis
[[File:Nucleus ER golgi ex.jpg|thumb|right|1. Nuclear membrane
2. Nuclear pore
3. Rough endoplasmic reticulum (REM)
4. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
5. Ribosome attached to REM
6. Macromolecules
7. Transport vesicles
8. Golgi apparatus''
9. Cis'' face of Golgi apparatus''
10. Trans'' face of Golgi apparatus
11. Cisternae of Golgi apparatus
12. Secretory vesicle
13. Cell membrane
14. Fused secretory vesicle releasing contents
15. Cell cytoplasm
16. Extracellular environment]]

===Golgi Apparatus===

Structure

*Similar to smooth ER, more compact

Function

*Collect, process and sort molecules.

The stack of flattened sacs (cisternae) are constantly being formed by vesicles budding off at the end of smooth ER and being broken down at the other end to form Golgi vesicles.

===Ribosome=== 

Structure

*One large and one smaller subunit 
*Comprise of RNA (ribosomal) and protein
*20nm size

Function

*Protein synthesis

[[File:Ribosome structure fixed.png|thumb|left|Ribosome structure]]

===Lysosome===

Structure

*Around 0.1-1.0µm in diameter
*Membrane surrounding digestive enzymes known as hydrolases

Functions

*Digesting worn out organelles, or bacterium taken in during phagocytosis
*Bind to the cell membrane and release their enzymes outside of it in a process known as exocytosis like exocism

===Cilia and flagella===

These two organelles are almost identical except that cilia are shorter and more numerous. Their structure is a two central micro tubules, surrounded by nine pairs of micro tubules on the outside, wrapped in a plasma membrane, in a long elongated shape similar to a hair. Their function can either be to move an entire organism or to move material within an organism. An example of the latter is the cilia in the trachea moving mucus along the throat. 
[[File:Aplysia californica rhinophore 4.jpg|thumb|right|Numerous bunched cilia extending from a common pore. Also evident are pores lacking obvious bunched cilia.]]

===Centriole===

A centriole is a hollow cylinder formed from a ring of microtubules and used to grow the spindle fibres used in nuclear division.


===Plasma Membrane===

This is a very thin phospholipid bi-layer. It controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell; further explanation can be found later in this book.


&lt;u&gt;&lt;big&gt;Plants Only&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/u&gt;

===Chloroplast===

These are relatively large organelles which are only in photosynthesising cells, are green in colour due to the presence of the pigment chlorophyll, and at high magnifications grana can be seen in them. Grana are used in photosynthesis which will be discussed more later. 

[[File:Chloroplast-new.jpg|thumb|right]]

===Vacuole===

The vacuole is a fluid filled sac bound by a single membrane - it contains a solution of sugars, amino acids, waste products and mineral salts. It can serve as a temporary store, for waste or food, and can also contain hydrolytic enzymes. They also support some plants by providing an osmotic system which creates a pressure potential.


===Cell Wall===

Functions of the cell wall in plant cells include preventing the cell bursting when osmosis allows water to enter and provides the cell with structure and a definite shape.

===Plasmodesmata===

These fine strands of cytoplasm are linked through the cell wall, connecting neighbouring cells.

==Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes==

Karyote means 'nucleus' and thus prokaryote means 'before nucleus' which is an easy way to remember that these are the less complex cell type. They are also 1,000 to 10,000 times smaller than eukaryotes.

The table below is a comparison of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells:

=Tissues and Organs= 

*Tissue: A collection of cells specialised to perform one or more functions, and the cells do not have to be of the same type - merely collectively perform the same functions.

*Organ: Composed of more than one type of tissue which forms a structural and functional unit. Leaves, the brain, the heart are all examples of organs.

*System: Collection of organs with the same function, such as the digestive system.

== Epithelium ==

Epithelial tissue is tissue that forms sheets covering surfaces and both the types you are required to learn about are said to be simple epithelia as they are one cell thick. They rest on a basement membrane, which is NOT a cell membrane, but rather a network of collagen and glycoproteins and holds the epithelium cells in place.


===Squamous Epithelium===

Squamous Epithelium is very smooth, flat and thin - they fit together like floor tiles providing a smooth almost frictionless surface over which fluids can move easily. The thickness (or lack thereof) in epithelium aids in processes like diffusion. This type of epithelium cell covers many surfaces in the body, for example the inner surfaces of atria and blood vessels. It also forms alveoli walls.

===Ciliated Epithelium===

This is epithelium with cilia and is found for example in the trachea, where it is tall and narrow and the cilia is used to waft mucus along the trachea. 

===Glandular Epithelium===
This is epithelium with cells that excrete some substance in the body. Some substances it secretes include hormones, mucous, and lubricating fluid.

I saw your request for help on Robert Horning's talk page. I've fixed the formatting of the text that you added to [[Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations/Egyptians]]. It was simply a matter or removing the spaces at the beginning of the first line of each paragraph.

Citing your sources is always a good idea. But, as this is a Wikijunior book, I would add your references to the talk page [[Talk:Wikijunior_Ancient_Civilizations/Egyptians]] instead of the main article (somebody has already stated it there).

==Translation Practise==

===31st August===

Mars is the English name for the fourth planet from the sun in our solar system . &lt;br&gt;
Mars ist der englische Name des vierte Planeten von der Sonne in unserem Sonnensystem.&lt;br&gt;

            correction(cor): des vierten Planeten (genetive clause)
                 'von der Sonne' is ok, but better would be 'von der Sonne aus (gesehen)'
                 meaning 'from the sun's point of view'


Mars is named after the Roman god of war because it is red and red is the colour of blood.&lt;br&gt;
Mars ist...............ist rot und rot ist die Farbe des Blut.&lt;br&gt;
     cor: is named= ist benannt
     after the Roman god of war= nach dem römischen Gott des Krieges
     because=weil
     Farbe des Blutes (again genetive)

Mars has 2 very small moons called Phobus and Deimos.&lt;br&gt;
Mars hat zwei sehr kleine Monde....Phobus und Deimos.&lt;br&gt;
     cor: called= die genannt werden (maybe think of the long English version ', that are called')

The planet Mars is made of rock. &lt;br&gt;
Der Planet, Mars, ist aus Stein. &lt;br&gt;
      cor: why commas? Mars belongs to planet, it's both subject, 'ist aus' is alright, but 'besteht  
      aus'(consists of) sounds better :P

Th e ground there is red because of iron oxide (rust) in the rock and dust. &lt;br&gt;
Der Boden ist rot wegen Rost in den Stein und Staub.&lt;br&gt;
     cor: there=dort
     wegen Rost is pretty good, you could also use your favorite, the genetive ;), wegen des Rosts
     a comma after rot would be better too, but I don't know if it is necessary.
     is rock supposed to be plural? if so, it should be 'in den Steinen', if it's singular then it     
     should be 'im Stein (better: im Gestein)
     dust, mhh yes, maybe you should make it to 'dust in the air', so 'im Staub in der Luft', but I  
     dont get the English right there .

The planet has a very thin carbon dioxide atmosphere. &lt;br&gt;
Der Planet hat ein sehr dünnes...... Atmosphäre.&lt;br&gt;
     cor: Atmosphäre= female (die ~)
     carbon dioxide= Kohlenstoffdioxid I guess

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many computer languages share a core set of features.  Sometimes they
are very similar in different languages, sometimes radically
different.  Some features regarded by users of one language as
indispensable may be completely missing from other perfectly usable
languages.

==Statements==
A statement in Visual Basic is like a command given to the computer.
Functions and subroutines are made out of statements.

A statement generally consists of the name of a subroutine followed
by a list of arguments:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Debug.Print &quot;Hello World&quot;&lt;/source&gt;

The first word (Debug) is the name of a built in object in Visual
Basic.  the second word (Print) is the name of a method of that
object.  &quot;Hello World&quot; is the argument to the method.  The result is:

  Hello World

printed to the ''Immediate Window''.  

In Visual Basic Classic subroutine call statements can be written in
two ways:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  x &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;
  Call x(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

x is a subroutine which takes two string arguments.  The keyword
''Call'' is a leftover from older versions of Basic.  If you use this
form you must enclose the entire argument list in a parenthesis. Sometimes the programmer wants to call a function but is not interested in the return value only in the side-effects.  In such cases he or she will call the function as though it were a subroutine, however only the first form above can be used.  

There are other more complex statements which can span several lines
of code:

*If..Else..End If
*Do While..Loop

These compound statements include other statements and expressions.

==Variables==

Like most programming languages, Visual Basic is able to use and process named variables and their contents. '''Variables''' are most simply described as names by which we refer to some location in memory - a location that holds a value with which we are working. 

It often helps to think of variables as a 'pigeonhole', or a placeholder for a value. You can think of a variable as being equivalent to its value. So, if you have a variable ''i'' that is initialized to 4, ''i+1'' will equal ''5''.

In Visual Basic variables can be ''declared'' before using them or the programmer can let the compiler allocate space for them.  For any but the simplest programs it is better to declare all variables.  This has several benefits:

* you get the datatype you want instead of ''Variant'',
* the compiler can sometimes check that you have used the correct type.

''All'' variables in Visual Basic are typed, even those declared as ''Variant''. If you don't specify the type then the compiler will use Variant.  A Variant variable is one that can hold data of any type.

=== Declaration of Variables===
Here is an example of declaring an integer, which we've called &lt;tt&gt;some_number&lt;/tt&gt;.  

  Dim some_number As Integer

You can also declare multiple variables with one statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim anumber, anothernumber, yetanothernumber As Integer&lt;/source&gt;

This is not a good idea because it is too easy to forget that in
Visual Basic the type name applies only to the ''immediately
preceding'' variable name.  The example declares two ''Variants'' and
one ''Integer''

You can demonstrate what actually happens by this little program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Option Explicit
  
  Public Sub main()
    
    Dim anumber, anothernumber, yetanothernumber As Integer
    Dim v As Variant
    
    Debug.Print TypeName(anumber), VarType(anumber), _
         TypeName(anothernumber), VarType(anothernumber), _
         TypeName(yetanothernumber), VarType(yetanothernumber)
    
    Debug.Print TypeName(anumber), VarType(v)
    
    Debug.Print &quot;Assign a number to anumber&quot;
    anumber = 1
    Debug.Print TypeName(anumber), VarType(anumber)
    
    Debug.Print &quot;Assign a string to anumber&quot;
    anumber = &quot;a string&quot;
    Debug.Print TypeName(anumber), VarType(anumber)
    
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

The result is:

  Empty          0            Empty          0            Integer        2 
  Empty          0 
  Assign a number to anumber
  Integer        2 
  Assign a string to anumber
  String         8

Notice that both VarType and TypeName return information about the variable stored inside the Variant not the Variant itself.

To declare three integers in succession then, use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim anumber As Integer, anothernumber As Integer, yetanothernumber As Integer&lt;/source&gt;

In Visual Basic it is not possible to combine ''declaration'' and ''initialization'' with variables (as VB does not support constructors - see Objects and Initialise though), the following statement is illegal:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim some_number As Integer = 3&lt;/source&gt;

Only constant declarations allow you to do this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Const some_number As Integer = 3&lt;/source&gt;

In Visual Basic variables may be declared anywhere inside a
subroutine, function or property, where their scope is restricted to that routine. 
They may also be declared in the ''declarations'' section of a module before any subroutines, functions or properties, where they have module level scope.  

By default, variables do not have to be declared before use.  Any variables created this way, will be of ''Variant'' type.  This behaviour can be overrriden by using the Option Explicit statement at the top of a module and will force the programmer to declare all variables before use.

After declaring variables, you can assign a value to a variable later on using a statement like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Let some_number = 3&lt;/source&gt;

The use of the Let keyword is optional, so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;some_number = 3&lt;/source&gt;

is also a valid statement.

You can also assign a variable the value of another variable, like so:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;anumber = anothernumber&lt;/source&gt;

In Visual Basic you cannot assign multiple variables the same value
with one statement.  the following statement does not do what a C
programmer would expect:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;anumber = anothernumber = yetanothernumber = 3&lt;/source&gt;

Instead it treats all but the first ''='' signs as ''equality test
operators'' and then assigns either ''True'' or ''False'' to
''anumber'' depending on the values of ''anothernumber'' and
''yetanotherniumber''.

====Naming Variables====
Variable names in Visual Basic are made up of letters (upper and lower
case) and digits. The underscore character, &quot;_&quot;, is also
permitted. Names must not begin with a digit. Names can be as long as
you like.

Some examples of valid (but not very descriptive) Visual Basic variable names:

  foo
  Bar
  BAZ
  foo_bar
  a_foo42_
  QuUx

Some examples of invalid Visual Basic variable names:
;2foo:must not begin with a digit
;my foo:spaces not allowed in names
;$foo:$ not allowed -- only letters, digits, and _
;while:language keywords cannot be used as names
;_xxx:leading underscore not allowed. 

Certain words are reserved as keywords in the language, and these
cannot be used as variable names, or indeed as names of anything else.

In addition there are certain sets of names that, while not language keywords, are reserved for one reason or another.

The naming rules for variables also apply to other language constructs
such as function names and module names.

It is good practice to get into the habit of using descriptive variable names. If you look at a section of code many months after you created it and see the variables &lt;code&gt;var1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;var2&lt;/code&gt; etc., you will more than likely have no idea what they control. Variable names such as &lt;code&gt;textinput&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;time_start&lt;/code&gt; are much more descriptive - you know exactly what they do. If you have a variable name comprised of more than one word, it is convention to begin the next word with a capital letter. Remember you can't use spaces in variable names, and sensible capital use makes it easier to distinguish between the words. When typing the variable name later in the code, you can type all in lowercase - once you leave the line in question, if the variable name is valid VB will capitalize it as appropriate.

===Literals===

Anytime within a program in which you specify a value explicitly
instead of referring to a variable or some other form of data, that
value is referred to as a '''literal'''. In the initialization example
above, 3 is a literal.  Numbers can be written as whole numbers,
decimal fractions, 'scientific' notation or hex.  To identify a hex number,
simply prefix the number with &amp;H.

==Conditions==
Conditional clauses are blocks of code that will only execute if a
particular expression (the condition) is true. 

===If Statements===

If statements are the most flexible conditional statements: see [[Visual Basic/Branching|Branching]]

===Select Case===

Often it is necessary to compare one specific variable against several values. For this kind of conditional expression the ''[[Visual Basic/Branching#Select Case|Select Case]]'' statement is used.

==Unconditionals==

[[../Branching#Unconditionals|Unconditionals]] let you change the flow of your program without a
condition.  These are the Exit, End and Goto statements.

==Loops==

[[../Loops#Do Loops|Loops]] allow you to have a set of statements repeated over and over again.

To repeat a given piece of code a set number of times or for every element in a list: see [[Visual Basic/Loops#For..Next Loops|For..Next Loops]]

*Average age (for sporadic cases) is 63
*Increased risk with moderate/heavy alcohol use, animal fat, and red meat.
*Folate intake associated with a decreased risk.

==Survival==
*Stage I: 85-100%
*Stage IIA: 70%
*Stage IIB: 30%
*Stage IIIA-B: 60%
*Stage IIIC: 30%
*Stage IV: 3%

==Adjuvant chemotherapy==
===Regimens===
(Note: This section is intended to highlight some of the common chemotherapy regimens used today, but an in-depth discussion of chemotherapy should be reserved for a Medical Oncology textbook)

Chemotherapy is recommended for all Stage III (i.e. node-positive) patients. Some stage II (T3-4 N0) patients may also benefit, but the treatment is made on a case-by-case basis.

*Mayo Regimen (5-FU/LV)
**5-FU, 425 mg/m2/d IV days 1-5.  LV 20 mg/m2/d IV days 1-5. Repeat q28d x 6 cycles.
*Roswell Park (5-FU/LV)
**5-FU, 500 mg/m2/d IV weekly x 6. LV 500 mg/m2/d IV weekly x 6. Repeat q8w x 4 cycles.
*FOLFOX 4 (5-FU/LV/Oxaliplatin)
**Oxaliplatin, 85 mg/m2 IV day 1. LV, 200 mg/m2/day IV days 1-2. 5-FU, 400 mg/m2/day IV days 1-2. 5-FU, 600 mg/m2/day CI over 22 h, days 1-2. Repeat q14d x 12 cycles.
*IFL (bolus 5-FU/LV/Irinotecan) - not used, excess mortality from increased toxicity
*FOLFIRI (infusional 5-FU/LV/Irinotecan) 
*Xeloda (capecitabine)
**1250 mg/m2 BID x 14 days. Repeat q21d x 8 cycles. 

===Trials===
''See:'' [[Radiation Oncology/Colon/NSABP trials|NSABP Colon trials]]

*'''CALGB 89803'''
**Randomized. 1264 patients with completely resected Stage III colon CA. Treated with weekly bolus 5-FU/Leukovorin +/- irinotecan
**'''2007''' PMID 17687149 -- &quot;Irinotecan fluorouracil plus leucovorin is not superior to fluorouracil plus leucovorin alone as adjuvant treatment for stage III colon cancer: results of CALGB 89803.&quot; (Saltz LB, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 10;25(23):3456-61.)
***Outcome: No difference in DFS or OS
***Toxicity: Significantly higher in 5-FU/LV/Irinotecan arm
***Conclusion: Addition of irinotecan not beneficial in completely resected Stage III

*'''NSABP C-01''' (1977-83)
**1166 pts. Dukes B and C. Randomized after curative resection to 1) chemotherapy with 5-FU, semustine, and vincristine, 2) BCG, or 3) no further treatment.  
**First report: PMID 3276901 (1988)
***Showed increase in DFS and survival for chemotherapy. Increased survival but not DFS for BCG (due to decrease in non-cancer related deaths)
**10-year results: PMID 15292384 (2004)
***No difference in DFS or survival for chemotherapy group.  Decrease in non-cancer related deaths for BCG. 
**Conclusion: DFS benefit for chemotherapy disappears by 10 years.

==Pelvic Recurrence==
*'''Mayo, 2001''' (1981-1994) PMID 11286833 -- &quot;Intraoperative irradiation for locally recurrent colorectal cancer in previously irradiated patients.&quot; (Haddock MG, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Apr 1;49(5):1267-74.)
**Retrospective. 51 patients. Salvage surgery + IORT after prior EBRT. IORT 20 Gy (10-30) + in 37 patients EBRT median 25 Gy + 20 patients 5-FU
**Median OS: 23 months; 2-year OS 48%
**2-year LR: 40%; trend to improvement if IORT + EBRT &gt;30 Gy (LR 19%). 2-year DM: 56%
**Side effects: peripheral neuropathy related to IORT (32% patients); ureteral narrowing/obstruction
**Conclusion: local control can be obtained, but survival poor due to distant mets

*'''MD Anderson, 1996''' PMID 8597512 -- &quot;Preoperative infusional chemoradiation, selective intraoperative radiation, and resection for locally advanced pelvic recurrence of colorectal adenocarcinoma.&quot; (Lowy AM, Ann Surg. 1996 Feb;223(2):177-85.)
**Prospective. 43 patients with locally advanced pelvic recurrence of CRC. Treated with RT 45 Gy + C.I. 5-FU and/or cisplatin, followed by surgery + IORT 10-20 Gy or BT. Median F/U 26 months
**40 patients underwent surgery, 77% with curative intent. 88% SM-, 48% sphincter-preserving
**Side effects: 51%
**LR rate: 36%, 5-year OS: 58%
**Conclusion: Preop CRT can increase resectability and enable sphincter preservation

==Chemotherapy for metastatic disease==
'''Randomized trials for first-line therapy'''
*'''BICC-C''' -- Irinotecan-based regimens
**Randomized. 430 patients. Arm 1) FOLFIRI (infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan) vs. Arm 2) mIFL (bolus 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan) vs. Arm 3) CapeIRI (capecitabine, irinotecan). Concurrently +/- celecoxib. After amendment, dropped Arm 3. Then additional 117 patients radnomized to bevacizumab: FOLFIRI-Bev or mILF-Bev. Primary endpoint PFS
**'''2007''' PMID 17947725 -- &quot;Randomized, controlled trial of irinotecan plus infusional, bolus, or oral fluoropyrimidines in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: results from the BICC-C Study.&quot; (Fuchs CS, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 20;25(30):4779-86.)
***Outcome: PFS FOLFIRI 7.6 month vs. mIFL 5.9 months (SS) vs. CapeIRI (SS).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Elliptic curve cryptography is a type of cryptography that relies on mathematical structures known as &quot;elliptic curves&quot; and &quot;finite fields&quot;. An elliptic curve is a relation of the form &lt;math&gt;y^2 = x^3 + ax + b&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are preset parameters of the curve and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates. Any &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; pair that satisfies the relation is said to be a point on the elliptic curve. On elliptic curve points, it is possible to define an operation known as &quot;addition&quot; as follows:

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
[[Image:ECClines.svg]]
&lt;/div&gt;

To add two points &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, draw a line through them, and locate the third point on the curve that the line passes through; call it &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; have the same x coordinate, the line joining them will be vertical and R will not exist, so in that case we call &lt;math&gt;P + Q&lt;/math&gt; the &quot;point at infinity&quot;. The point at infinity added to any other point is that point itself, so this point at infinity can be thought of as the elliptic curve point analogue of the number zero. Otherwise, trace a vertical line from &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; to the point at the same x coordinate on the opposite side of the curve. This point is defined as &lt;math&gt;P+Q&lt;/math&gt;. To calculate &lt;math&gt;P+P&lt;/math&gt;, instead take the tangent line to the curve at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, extend it to &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and take the vertically opposite point as the answer just like in the &lt;math&gt;P+Q&lt;/math&gt; case.

Because elliptic curves are mathematical functions, we can use the tools of high-school algebra and elementary calculus to derive formulas for &lt;math&gt;P+Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P+P&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;P+Q&lt;/math&gt;, for formula is:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{P_y-Q_y}{P_x-Q_x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(P+Q)_x = m^2 - P_x - Q_x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(P+Q)_y = P_y + m(R_x - P_x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For P+P:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{3P_x^2 + a}{2P_y}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(P+P)_x = m^2 - 2*P_x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(P+P)_y = P_y + m(R_x - P_x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Notice that the algorithm in both cases is the same: first we find the slope at &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, then we get the x-coordinate of the answer, and then we use the slope-point formula to get the y-coordinate. From these formulas, however, we get a very surprising result: &lt;math&gt;(A+B)+C = A+(B+C)&lt;/math&gt;, regardless of whether &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are different or the same. Additionally, from the visual definition it is obvious that &lt;math&gt;A+B = B+A&lt;/math&gt;. These facts together mean that elliptic curve points form what is known as an _abelian group_ - a structure which supports addition, and therefore by extension multiplication by integers. For example, &lt;math&gt;4A = (A+A) + (A+A) = (A+(A+A))+A = (A+(A+(A+A)))&lt;/math&gt;.

It's also quite easy to multiply an elliptic curve point by very large numbers. You might think multiplying a point by a billion requires you to add it to itself a billion times, but in reality there is a much simpler algorithm:

&lt;code&gt;
  define multiply(P, k) {
    if (k == 0) return point_at_infinity()
    if (k == 1) return P;
    if (k % 2 == 0) return double(multiply(P,k/2))
    if (k % 2 == 1) return add(P,double(multiply(P,(k-1)/2)))
  }
&lt;/code&gt;

Basically, instead of repeatedly adding on the original point to zero many times, the algorithm repeatedly uses doubling, cutting the size of the problem in half at every step. For &lt;math&gt;k=83&lt;/math&gt;, for example, the algorithm expands to:&lt;br&gt;

  83p
  add(p,double(41p))
  add(p,double(add(p,double(20p))))
  add(p,double(add(p,double(double(10p)))))
  add(p,double(add(p,double(double(double(5p))))))
  add(p,double(add(p,double(double(double(add(p,double(2p))))))))
  add(p,double(add(p,double(double(double(add(p,double(double(p)))))))))

For &lt;math&gt;k = 1000000000&lt;/math&gt;, the algorithm takes a mere thirty steps. This makes it possible to multiply elliptic curve numbers by extremely large numbers - numbers so large, in fact, that there are not enough atoms in the universe to actually count to them.

== Finite Fields ==

Now, we get into the more interesting part of elliptic curve mathematics. A while ago, mathematicians discovered that the forms of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division that we use today are not the only forms that are mathematically consistent. There are in fact many other structures, some using numbers and others using more complex forms like polynomials, over which we can define the basic operations in special ways and still have a working system of algebra. The most common is &quot;modular arithmetic&quot;. Modular addition and multiplication are just like normal addition and multiplication, except after the calculation is done you divide the result by a preset value, called the &quot;modulus&quot;, and take only the remainder. For example, in modulo 7:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3 + 6 = 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
and&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;5 * 4 = 20 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Subtraction is similar, except if the result turns out to be negative you add the modulus to force it to be positive again. Thus:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; 1 - 2 = -1 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Division is more complicated to implement, but is defined through multiplication - that is, &lt;math&gt;a/b \pmod{7}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be a number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;bc \equiv a \pmod{7}&lt;/math&gt;. It can be proven that all modular divisions have an answer and no modular divisions have multiple possible answers if and only if the modulus is prime. Thus, we generally only care about &quot;prime fields&quot;.

So what's the point of this spooky kind of arithmetic? Basically, it's a great kind of arithmetic to do elliptic curves over. No matter how much you add or multiply points together, the coordinates of the result will always be integers in the range &lt;math&gt;[0...p-1]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the modulus. The &quot;wrap around&quot; property also makes the structure cryptographically secure; given a normal elliptic curve, given two points &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q = k*G&lt;/math&gt;, you can figure out the value of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; by looking at the size of the output and using that information to zero in on a small range of possibilities. With an elliptic curve over a prime field, all points look essentially the same; they're all numbers roughly evenly distributed within the range &lt;math&gt;[0...p-1]&lt;/math&gt;. The hardness of this problem, figuring out &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k*G&lt;/math&gt;, is in fact the basis of elliptic curve cryptography's security.

The two most well-known algorithms over elliptic curves are the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman] protocol and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm], used for encrypting and signing messages, respectively.

==Risk of invasive cancer==
*'''SEER data''', 2005 (1973-98) - PMID 16110014 &amp;mdash; &quot;Bilateral risk for subsequent breast cancer after lobular carcinoma-in-situ: analysis of surveillance, epidemiology, and end results data.&quot; Chuba PJ et al. J Clin Oncol. 2005 Aug 20;23(24):5534-41.
**Incidence of invasive carcinoma 7.1% at 10 yrs, 18% at 25 yrs. 
**46% ipsilateral / 54% contralateral. Higher proportion of cancers with ILC than in the general population (23.1% vs 6.5%).
**Conclusion: LCIS is associated with increased risk of subsequent invasive breast cancer, which can occur with roughly equal probability in either breast.

==Prevention of invasive cancer==
*'''P-1 prevention trial'''
**See page at [[Radiation Oncology/Breast/Prevention|Prevention]] for detail.
**43% risk reduction with tamoxifen overall (46% for those with LCIS).

==Surgery alone==
*'''NSABP''' - PMID 14716756 &amp;mdash; &quot;Pathologic findings from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project: twelve-year observations concerning lobular carcinoma in situ.&quot; Fisher ER et al. Cancer. 2004 Jan 15;100(2):238-44. 
**Analysis of previous NSABP trial. 12-year results of 180 pts treated with surgical excision only.
**IBTR in 14.4% and CBTR in 7.8%.  9 of 26 IBTR and 10 of 14 CBTR were invasive, mostly invasive lobular carcinoma. 
**Conclusion: LCIS is an indolent disease and can be managed with conservative surgery

==LCIS concurrent with breast carcinoma==
*'''U. Michigan; 2006''' (1989-2003) PMID 16329136 -- &quot;Is lobular carcinoma in situ as a component of breast carcinoma a risk factor for local failure after breast-conserving therapy? Results of a matched pair analysis.&quot; (Ben-David MA, Cancer. 2006 Jan 1;106(1):28-34.)
**Retrospective. 64 pts with Stage 0-II (DCIS or invasive ca.) breast carcinoma with LCIS as a component of the primary tumor. Compared with matched controls (LCIS-).
**Conclusion: The extent of LCIS and its presence at the margins did not reduce the excellent rates of local control after BCS+RT. The data suggest that LCIS in the tumor specimen, even when multifocal, should not affect selection of patients for BCS and whole-breast RT.

==Pleomorphic LCIS==
Uncommon (12% of LCIS cases). May be associated with invasive carcinoma (usually invasive lobular) 25% of the time. Biologically can behave similar to high grade DCIS. 
&lt;P&gt;Treatment is controversial. Some recommend complete excision with negative margins (see NCCN Guidelines 2011-1).

**Conclusion: &quot;This is the first series, to our knowledge, that evaluates margin status in patients with PLCIS and documents recurrence. Recurrent PLCIS was identified at a rate similar to low- or intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. Therefore, known methods of local control, including surgical excision with negative margins (2 mm), may be the appropriate treatment in these patients.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Discussion outside shepherd's pie ==

I am thinking of taking [[Cookbook:Shepherd's Pie | Shepherd's Pie]] and [[Cookbook:Pate Chinois | Pate Chinois]] and mucking with them as I have the [[Cookbook:Brownie | Brownies]] and [[Cookbook:Candied Sweet Potatoes | Candied Sweet Potatoes]].  And, since I have my own shepherd's pie recipe, I may just add a third while I am going through the trouble - as I did with the sweet potatoes.  I would be turning the name pate chinois into the secondary name for it's entry, since it is a misnomer like french fries or indian corn.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 20:48, 28 August 2005 (UTC)

:At least 2 of the 3 recipes on the [[Cookbook:Candied Sweet Potatoes | Candied Sweet Potatoes]] page simply don't qualify because they involve mashing the sweet potatoes. The other recipe is mostly apples and raisins, so it really isn't standard, but it might just barely kind of squeak by as a Candied Sweet Potatoes recipe. Probably the disambigation page should just be deleted. The recipes came about because somebody put a link on the [[Cookbook:Requested_Recipes]] page. Somebody else then supplied the wrong thing. I tried to help the original requester (and myself, as I need the recipe too) by adding a [[Cookbook:Glazed Sweet Potatoes|Glazed Sweet Potatoes]] link, which is really the same thing under a different name. (it's still not there) Proper glazed/candied sweet potatoes are chunks about 1 inch in diameter, baked (while covered?) in a sugary sauce until soft. The sauce probably involves brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:05, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Well, since I'd never eaten them myself and only had a recipe for it in the ol' family cookbook I split what to me was two good enough recipes and added one that I thought fit better.  Since they were  submitted as Candied Sweet Potatoes, I figured the submitter would know better than I.  If you'd like, I could change Diana's to simply being the Candied Sweet Potatoes recipe, since I only added the name because she was the one who wrote in the recipe.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 15:54, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

:::I'd prefer to reserve &quot;Candied Sweet Potatoes&quot; and &quot;Glazed Sweet Potatoes&quot; for the standard recipe. I guess that means deleting the disambiguation page until a proper recipe shows up. If we someday are lucky enough to have two normal recipes, then a disambiguation page would make sense. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:38, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

:::&quot;Diana's Candied Sweet Potatoes&quot; could become &quot;Candied Sweet Potatoes with Apples and Raisins&quot;, but the current name is fine. Aside from the extra fruit, the recipe doesn't seem to be all that abnormal. I'm not totally sure about the honey; I suspect molasses or brown sugar would be more typical. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:38, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

:::: Well, I'll ask some of the family for their cookbooks and see if they have a more plain jane version.  Hell, considering I have like 8 I can probably find one myself.  [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 01:51, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== Cottage pie or shepherd's pie ==

I can find no prime reference to support the use of cottage pie for beef and shepherd's pie for lamb/mutton - except to say that Merriam-Webster on-line implies that cottage pie especially is made with beef. However, Merriam-Webster is a USA source and this is a traditional British dish. Researching prime British reference sources, I find that the two terms are entirely synonymous.

Sources I have personally referred to are:

* Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management by Isabella Beeton, 1861.
* Cassell's New Universal Cookery Book by Lizzie Heritage published by Cassell and Company, 1894
* The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, published by Oxford University Press, 1933
* The Constance Spry Cookery Book by Constance Spry and Rosemary Hume, published by J M Dent &amp; Sons, 1956
* Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, published by Merriam-Webster, 1983
* The Glutton's Glossary: A Dictionary of Food and Drink Terms by John Ayto, published by Routledge, 1990
* The Chambers Dictionary, Ninth Edition, published by Chambers Harrap Publishing Ltd, 2003
* Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Eleventh Edition (Revised), published Oxford University Press, 2006

Of shepherd's pie, the 1983 Webster's does not specify the meat, and makes no mention of cottage pie. From this, it seems that the term &quot;shepherd's pie&quot; was the one favoured in the USA, and that the use of two terms for the same dish has very recently been rationalised by attributing &quot;shepherd's pie&quot; to mutton or lamb, for no reason other than shepherds being obviously concerned with sheep more than cattle.

[[User:Often Stranger Than Fiction|Often Stranger Than Fiction]] ([[User talk:Often Stranger Than Fiction|talk]]) 07:08, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

: Aren't shepherds ''only'' concerned with sheep? Anyway regardless, the lamb/beef distinction certainly seems to be a modern consensus, and when this topic comes up in forums there are frequently people saying that they were taught this by a parent or grandparent. The cited recipe books are old, as are most of the dictionaries, and the distinction can also be found in more modern recipes. It may be a case that dictionaries are now in need of updating to reflect more popular usage. I must admit that I used not to draw a distinction myself, but with dishes nowadays typically made with the fresh meat of choice rather than one being confined to using whatever scraps could be salvaged from previous meals, it is definitely useful to have distinct terms.

== Shepherd's pie or shepherds' pie? ==

This is what confuses me at the moment. If the wording is used in a context relating to the class of people known as shepherds as a whole rather than being attributed to a specific shepherd, shouldn't the correct usage be shepherds'? For example, &quot;On our farm, the shepherd's pie of choice is shepherds' pie&quot;. Without a distinction, another example might be an unsolvable riddle: &quot;The carpenter made a shepherd's pie and the shepherd made a leek pie. The best pie was the shepherd's pie. Did the best pie contain meat?&quot;.

The current one is frightening.

== Comments on the article ==

This article is confusing and incomplete. Peas, corn and carrots seem to be part of the recipe but it's not clear when they come into play and how they should be cooked. The temperature for the oven is not given so a wild guess would probably spoil the taste of the final product. At the bottom of the article, there is a link that points to &quot;sheperds pie&quot; which to me seems just a redundant copy of this article. Besides, the two versions vary in terms of spelling, quantity of meat and potatoes and use of oil. The two articles should definitely be merged. The article also lists &quot;Pate Chinois&quot; and &quot;Pâté chinois&quot;. They both point to the same article so the first link is absolutely unnecessary, even more because the spelling is improper. The photograph that presents the shepherd's pie is truly frightening. It should really be changed. I do agree on the fact the shepherd's pie is made with lamb and the cottage pie is made with beef. Dictionaries don't have the last word. Cooking books are preferred when it comes to these things. Moreover, shepherds taking care of cattle don't make much sense.

I have put in a screenshot of the default workspace for Blender 2.54 as a taster. How should we go about reworking the following pages for the new Blender? Perhaps create a separate, parallel set of pages for the new version? Or have parallel info side by side on the existing pages? — [[User:Ldo|Ldo]] ([[User talk:Ldo|talk]]) 09:49, 23 October 2010 (UTC)
:Maintaining two copies of everything strikes me a maintenance nightmare.  Lets target the latest stable release (2.49b).  In the mean time, there's still plenty of work to be done adapting old tutorials to work with 2.49b. I feel you ''must'' add 2.5x tips to a module, please use {{Tlx|B3D:N2P/Hidden begin}} to avoid breaking the flow.--[[User:Stepheng3|Stepheng3]] ([[User talk:Stepheng3|talk]]) 00:09, 24 October 2010 (UTC)

==Yadda, Yadda...==

I think the joke about the simplicity about the user interface is overdone here. Actually the page could be removed completely in my opinion.

:: Honestly, if all my programs looked and worked like Blender, I'd probably stop using computers. Unless you use it every day, you have to reread tutorials every time you want to use it, because it's so completely backwards and thoroughly unintuitive, and requires so much excessive memorization (because the devs insist on doing everything completely different from other apps, just to be different), that you retain almost no memory of what you learned the last time you tried to use it. On top of that, by the time you get through even just the basics of the interface that are covered in every tutorial, you've wasted so much time already that you're ready to give up and try a 2D solution instead.

::It took me less than an hour to figure out how to get around in the GIMP when I first started using it. I've spent about fifty hours, spread out over the past two years, trying to figure out Blender, and I still haven't moved past having to relearn the interface basics every time I start it up. I can go months without using other programs, and never have this kind of trouble remembering the most basic elements of the interface, because their devs have the sense not to ignore every bit of research ever done on computer interface [[wikipedia:Usability|usability]]. The fact that every tutorial has to start with a ''long and involved'' introduction to the Blender interface is a clear indication that there's something seriously wrong with it. -- [[User:Rich333|Rich333]] 23:40, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

I love the Blender user interface with all my heart, I really do. Blender has really spoiled me with such friendly and extensive interface, that it's really true when I use any other program like Word or Excel or play games I wish the controls were as fluid and extensive as Blender's. Once you learn it and use it for a while you will really appreciate it. Trust me.--[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 13:11, 4 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Standard Template Library (STL)==
The '''Standard Template Library''' ('''STL'''), part of the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code#Core vs Standard Library|C++ Standard Library]], offers collections of algorithms, containers, iterators, and other fundamental components, implemented as templates, classes, and functions essential to extend functionality and standardization to C++. STL main focus is to provide improvements implementation standardization  with  emphasis in performance and correctness.

Instead of wondering if your array would ever need to hold 257 records or having nightmares of string buffer overflows, you can enjoy '''vector''' and '''string''' that automatically extend to contain more records or characters. For example, vector is just like an array, except that vector's size can expand to hold more cells or shrink when fewer will suffice. One must keep in mind that the STL does not conflict with OOP but in itself is not object oriented; In particular it makes no use of runtime polymorphism (i.e., has no virtual functions).

The true power of the STL lies not in its [[#Containers|container]] classes, but in the fact that it is a framework, combining algorithms with data structures using indirection through iterators to allow generic implementations of higher order algorithms to work efficiently on varied forms of data. To give a simple example, the same '''std::copy''' function can be used to copy elements from one array to another, or to copy the bytes of a file, or to copy the whitespace-separated words in &quot;text like this&quot; into a container such as '''std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;'''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 // std::copy from array a to array b
 int a[10] = { 3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,4 };
 int b[10];
 std::copy(&amp;a[0], &amp;a[9], b);

 // std::copy from input stream a to an arbitrary OutputIterator
 template &lt;typename OutputIterator&gt;
 void f(std::istream &amp;a, OutputIterator destination) {
   std::copy(std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt;(a),
             std::istreambuf_iterator&lt;char&gt;(),
             destination);
 }

 // std::copy from a buffer containing text, inserting items in
 // order at the back of the container called words.
 std::istringstream buffer(&quot;text like this&quot;);
 std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; words;
 std::copy(std::istream_iterator&lt;std::string&gt;(buffer),
           std::istream_iterator&lt;std::string&gt;(),
           std::back_inserter(words));
 assert(words[0] == &quot;text&quot;);
 assert(words[1] == &quot;like&quot;);
 assert(words[2] == &quot;this&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== History ===
[[Image:Alexander Stepanov.jpg|120px|right|Alexander Stepanov]]
The C++ Standard Library incorporated part of the STL (published as a software library by [[w:Silicon Graphics|SGI]]/Hewlett-Packard Company). The primary implementer of the C++ Standard Template Library was [[w:Alexander Stepanov|Alexander Stepanov]].

Today we call STL to what was adopted into the C++ Standard. The ISO C++ does not specify header content, and allows implementation of the STL either in the headers, or in a true library.

{{NOTE|In an interview Alexander Stepanov, stated that he originally, wanted all auxiliary functions in STL to be visible but it was not politically possible, especially the heap functions. That Bjarne did reduce the number of components in STL by a factor of two as to permit the adoption into the standard.}}

Compilers will already have one implementation included as part of the C++ Standard (i.e., MS Visual Studio uses the Dinkum STL). All implementations will have to comply to the standard's requirements regarding functionality and behavior, but consistency of programs across all major hardware implementations, operating systems, and compilers will also depends on the portability of the STL implementation. They may also offer extended features or be optimized to distinct setups. 

There are many different implementations of the STL, all based on the language standard but  nevertheless differing from each other, making it transparent for the programmer, enabling specialization and rapid evolution of the code base. Several open source implementations are available, which can be useful to consult.

;List of STL implementations.   
* libstdc++ from gnu (was part of libg++)
* SGI STL library (http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/) free STL implementation.
* Rogue Wave standard library (HP, SGI, SunSoft, Siemens-Nixdorf) / [[w:Apache C++ Standard Library|Apache C++ Standard Library (STDCXX)]]
* Dinkum STL library by P.J. Plauger (http://www.dinkumware.com/) commercial STL implementation widely used, since it was licensed in is co-maintained by Microsoft and it is the STL implementation that ships with Visual Studio.
* Apache C++ Standard Library ( http://stdcxx.apache.org/ ) (open source)
* STLport STL library (http://www.stlport.com/) open source and highly cross-platform implementation based on the SGI implementation.

{{NOTE|There are advantages on having compartmentalized functionalities, some developers actively avoid using some of the language features, for a multitude of reasons. C++ permits the programmer to chose how to express themself, have control over the development paradigms and not be constricted by an higher level of abstraction.}}

===Containers===
The containers we will discuss in this section of the book are part of the standard namespace (std::).  They all originated in the original SGI implementation of the STL.
 
{{NOTE|note=When choosing a container, you should have in mind what makes them different, this will help you produce more efficient code. See also the [[C++ Programming/Optimization|Optimization Section]] of the book, about [[C++ Programming/Optimization#The right data in the right container|using the right data in the right container]]. }}

====Sequence Containers====
; Sequences - easier than arrays :
Sequences are similar to C arrays, but they are easier to use. Vector is usually the first sequence to be learned. Other sequences, list and double-ended queues, are similar to vector but more efficient in some special cases.  (Their behavior is also different in important ways concerning validity of iterators when the container is changed; iterator validity is an important, though somewhat advanced, concept when using containers in C++.)

* vector - &quot;an easy-to-use array&quot;
* list - in effect, a doubly-linked list
* deque - double-ended queue (properly pronounced &quot;deck&quot;, often mispronounced as &quot;dee-queue&quot;)

=====vector=====
The '''vector''' is a template class in itself, it is a ''Sequence Container'' and allows you to easily create a [[w:dynamic array|dynamic array]] of elements (one type per instance) of almost any data-type or object within a programs when using it. The '''vector''' class handles most of the memory management for you.

Since a '''vector''' contain contiguous elements it is an ideal choice to replace the old C style array, in a situation where you need to store data, and ideal in a situation where you need to store dynamic data as an array that changes in size during the program's execution (old C style arrays can't do it). However, vectors do incur a very small overhead compared to static arrays (depending on the quality of your compiler), and cannot be initialized through an initialization list.

{{NOTE|
Vector is known to be slow when using the MSVC compiler due to the SECURE_SCL flag, that, by default, forces bounds checking even in optimized builds.}}

Accessing members of a vector or appending elements takes a fixed amount of time, no matter how large the vector is, whereas locating a specific value in a vector element or inserting elements into the vector takes an amount of time directly proportional to its location in it (size dependent).

{{NOTE|
If you create a vector you can access its data using consecutive pointers:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  std::vector&lt;type&gt; myvector(8);
  type * ptr = &amp;myvector[0];
  ptr[0], ptr[7]; // access the first and last objects in myvector
&lt;/source&gt;

this information is present in INCITS/ISO/IEC 14882-2003 but was not properly documented in the 1998 version of the C++ standard.&lt;br&gt;
Be aware that ptr[i] is faster than myvector.at(i) because no error checking is performed. Watch out for how long that pointer is valid. The contiguous nature of vectors is most often important when interfacing to C code.

You should also keep in mind that std::vector&lt;T&gt;::iterator may not be a pointer; using an iterator is the safest mode to access a container but safety has always a cost in performance.
}}

;Member Functions
The &lt;code&gt;vector&lt;/code&gt; class models the [http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/Container.html Container] [[w:concept (generic programming)|concept]], which means it has &lt;code&gt;begin()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;end()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;size()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;max_size()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;empty()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;swap()&lt;/code&gt; methods.

{{NOTE|Since most vector (or deque) implementations typically reserves some extra internal storage for future growth. Prefer the &lt;code&gt;swap()&lt;/code&gt; method when altering a standard vector size (or freeing the memory used) when memory resources becomes a factor.}}

* informative
**&lt;code&gt;vector::front&lt;/code&gt; - Returns reference to first element of vector.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::back&lt;/code&gt; - Returns reference to last element of vector.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::size&lt;/code&gt; - Returns number of elements in the vector.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::empty&lt;/code&gt; - Returns true if vector has no elements.
*standard operations
**&lt;code&gt;vector::insert&lt;/code&gt; - Inserts elements into a vector (single &amp; range), shifts later elements up. Inefficient.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::push_back&lt;/code&gt; - Appends (inserts) an element to the end of a vector, allocating memory for it if necessary. [[w:Amortized analysis|Amortized]] O(1) time.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::erase&lt;/code&gt; - Deletes elements from a vector (single &amp; range), shifts later elements down. Inefficient.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::pop_back&lt;/code&gt; -  Erases the last element of the vector, (possibly reducing capacity - usually it isn't reduced, but this depends on particular STL implementation). [[w:Amortized analysis|Amortized]] O(1) time.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::clear&lt;/code&gt; - Erases all of the elements.  Note however that if the data elements are pointers to memory that was created dynamically (e.g., the '''new''' operator was used), the memory will not be freed.
*allocation/size modification
**&lt;code&gt;vector::assign&lt;/code&gt; - Used to delete a ''origin'' '''vector''' and copies the specified elements to an empty ''target'' '''vector'''.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::reserve&lt;/code&gt; - Changes capacity (allocates more memory) of vector, if needed. In many STL implementations capacity can only grow, and is never reduced.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::capacity&lt;/code&gt; - Returns current capacity (allocated memory) of vector.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::resize&lt;/code&gt; - Changes the vector size.
* iteration
**&lt;code&gt;vector::begin&lt;/code&gt; - Returns an iterator to start traversal of the vector.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::end&lt;/code&gt; - Returns an iterator that points just beyond the end of the vector.
**&lt;code&gt;vector::at&lt;/code&gt; - Returns a reference to the data element at the specified location in the '''vector''', with bounds checking.

{{NOTE|
It is important to remember the distinctions of capacity(), size() and empty() when dealing with containers.
}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
vector&lt;int&gt; v;
for (vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator it = v.begin(); it!=v.end(); ++it/* increment operand is used to move to next element*/) {
    cout &lt;&lt; *it &lt;&lt; endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

======vector::Iterators======
std::vector&lt;T&gt; provides Random Access Iterators; as with all containers, the primary access to iterators is via begin() and end() member functions.  These are overloaded for const- and non-const containers, returning iterators of types std::vector&lt;T&gt;::const_iterator and std::vector&lt;T&gt;::iterator respectively.

{{TODO|Add missing data|C++ Programming}}

======vector examples======
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 /* Vector sort example */
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 #include &lt;vector&gt;
 
 int main()
 {
         using namespace std;
  
         cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sorting STL vector, \&quot;the easier array\&quot;... &quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
         cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter numbers, one per line.  Press ctrl-D to quit.&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
 
         vector&lt;int&gt; vec; 
         int tmp;
         while (cin&gt;&gt;tmp) {
                 vec.push_back(tmp);
         }
 
         cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sorted: &quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
         sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());   
         int i = 0;
         for (i=0; i&lt;vec.size(); i++) {
                 cout &lt;&lt; vec[i] &lt;&lt; endl;;
         }
 
         return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

The call to &lt;tt&gt;sort&lt;/tt&gt; above actually calls an instantiation of the function template &lt;tt&gt;std::sort&lt;/tt&gt;, which will work on any half-open range specified by two random access iterators.

If you like to make the code above more &quot;STLish&quot; you can write this program in the following way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;
 #include &lt;vector&gt;
 #include &lt;algorithm&gt;
 #include &lt;iterator&gt;
 
 int main()
 {
        using namespace std;
 
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sorting STL vector, \&quot;the easier array\&quot;... &quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter numbers, one per line.  Press ctrl-D to quit.&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
 
        istream_iterator&lt;int&gt; first(cin);
        istream_iterator&lt;int&gt; last;
        vector&lt;int&gt; vec(first, last);
 
        sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
 
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Sorted: &quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
 
        copy(vec.begin(), vec.end(), ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(cout, &quot;\n&quot;));
 
        return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

=====Linked lists=====
The STL provides a class template called '''list''' (part of the standard namespace (std::)) which implements a non-intrusive doubly-[[w:linked list|linked list]].  Linked lists can insert or remove elements in the middle in constant time, but do not have random access.  One useful feature of '''std::list''' is that references, pointers and iterators to items inserted into a list remain valid so long as that item remains in the list.

{{NOTE|Consider using vector instead of list for better cache coherency and avoid &quot;death by swapping&quot;, see the [[C++ Programming/Optimization|Optimization Section]], about using the [[C++ Programming/Optimization#The right data in the right container|right data in the right container]].
}}

====Associative Containers (key and value)====
This type of container point to each element in the container with a key value, thus simplifying searching containers for the programmer. Instead of iterating through an array or vector element by element to find a specific one, you can simply ask for people[&quot;tero&quot;]. Just like vectors and other containers, associative containers can expand to hold any number of elements.

=====Maps and Multimaps=====
''map'' and ''multimap'' are associative containers that manage key/value pairs as elements as seen above.  The elements of each container will sort automatically using the actual key for sorting criterion.  The difference between the two is that maps do not allow duplicates, whereas, multimaps does. 

* map - unique keys
* multimap - same key can be used many times
* set - unique key is the value
* multiset - key is the value, same key can be used many times

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  /* Map example - character distribution  */
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;
  #include &lt;map&gt;
  #include &lt;string&gt;
  #include &lt;cctype&gt;
 
  using namespace std;
 
  int main()
  {
          /* Character counts are stored in a map, so that 
           * character is the key.
           * Count of char a is chars['a']. */
          map&lt;char, long&gt; chars;
 
          cout &lt;&lt; &quot;chardist - Count character distributions&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
          cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Type some text. Press ctrl-D to quit.&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
          char c;
          while (cin.get(c)) {
                  // Upper A and lower a are considered the same 
                  c=tolower(static_cast&lt;unsigned char&gt;(c));
                  chars[c]=chars[c]+1; // Could be written as ++chars[c];
          }
 
          cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Character distribution: &quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
            
          string alphabet(&quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;);
          for (string::iterator letter_index=alphabet.begin(); letter_index != alphabet.end(); letter_index++) {
                  if (chars[*letter_index] != 0) {
                          cout &lt;&lt; char(toupper(*letter_index))
                               &lt;&lt; &quot;:&quot; &lt;&lt; chars[*letter_index]
                               &lt;&lt; &quot;\t&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; 
                  }
          }
          return 0;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Container Adapters ====
* stack - last in, first out (LIFO)
* queue - first in, first out (FIFO)
* priority queue

===Iterators===
C++'s iterators are one of the foundation of the STL. Iterators exist in languages other than C++, but C++ uses an unusual form of iterators, with pros and cons.

In C++, an iterator is a ''concept'' rather than a specific type, they are a generalization of the pointers as an abstraction for the use of containers. Iterators are further divided based on properties such as traversal properties.

The basic idea of an iterator is to provide a way to navigate over some collection of objects concept.

Some (overlapping) categories of iterators are:
* Singular iterators
* Invalid iterators
* Random access iterators
* Bidirectional iterators
* Forward iterators
* Input iterators
* Output iterators
* Mutable iterators

A pair of iterators '''[begin, end)''' is used to define a [[Algebra/Interval Notation|half open range]], which includes the element identified from '''begin''' to '''end''', except for the element identified by '''end'''.  As a special case, the half open range '''[x, x)''' is empty, for any valid iterator x.

{{NOTE|The range notation may vary, the meaning is to express the inclusion or exclusion of the range limits. An also common notation is [begin, end[ (meaning begin is part of the range and end is not).}}

The most primitive examples of iterators in C++ (and likely the inspiration for their syntax) are the built-in pointers, which are commonly used to iterate over elements within arrays.

====Iteration over a Container ====
Accessing (but not modifying) each element of a container &lt;tt&gt;group&lt;/tt&gt; of type &lt;tt&gt;''C''&lt;''T''&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; using an iterator.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 for (
      typename C&lt;T&gt;::const_iterator iter = group.begin();
      iter != group.end();
      ++iter
     )
 {
     T const &amp;element = *iter;
 
     // access element here
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Note the usage of typename. It informs the compiler that 'const_iterator' is a type as opposed to a static member variable.  (It is only necessary inside templated code, and indeed in C++98 is invalid in regular, non-template, code.  This may change in the next revision of the C++ standard so that the '''typename''' above is always permitted.)

Modifying each element of a container &lt;tt&gt;group&lt;/tt&gt; of type &lt;tt&gt;''C''&lt;''T''&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; using an iterator.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
 for (
      typename C&lt;T&gt;::iterator iter = group.begin();
      iter != group.end();
      ++iter
     )
 {
     T &amp;element = *iter;
 
     // modify element here
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

When modifying the container itself while iterating over it, some containers (such as vector) require care that the iterator doesn't become invalidated, and end up pointing to an invalid element.  For example, instead of:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  for (i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); ++i) {
    ...
    if (erase_required) {
      v.erase(i);
    }
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

Do:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
  for (i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); ) {
    ...
    if (erase_required) {
        i = v.erase(i);
    } else {
        ++i;
    }
  }
&lt;/source&gt;


The &lt;tt&gt;erase()&lt;/tt&gt; member function returns the next valid iterator, or &lt;tt&gt;end()&lt;/tt&gt;, thus ending the loop.  Note that &lt;tt&gt;++i&lt;/tt&gt; is ''not'' executed when &lt;tt&gt;erase()&lt;/tt&gt; has been called on an element.

===Functors===
A functor or function object, is an object that has an &lt;code&gt;operator ()&lt;/code&gt;.  The importance of functors is that they can be used in many contexts in which C++ functions can be used, whilst also having the ability to maintain state information.  Next to iterators, functors are one of the most fundamental ideas exploited by the STL.

The STL provides a number of pre-built functor classes; std::less, for example, is often used to specify a default comparison function for algorithms that need to determine which of two objects comes &quot;before&quot; the other.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

 #include &lt;vector&gt;
 #include &lt;algorithm&gt;
 #include &lt;iostream&gt;

 // Define the Functor for AccumulateSquareValues
 template&lt;typename T&gt;
 struct AccumulateSquareValues
 {
     AccumulateSquareValues() : sumOfSquares()
     {
     }
     void operator()(const T&amp; value)
     {
         sumOfSquares += value*value;
     }
     T Result() const
     {
         return sumOfSquares;
     }
     T sumOfSquares;
 };

 std::vector&lt;int&gt; intVec;
 intVec.reserve(10);
 for( int idx = 0; idx &lt; 10; ++idx )
 {
     intVec.push_back(idx);
 }
 AccumulateSquareValues&lt;int&gt; sumOfSquare = std::for_each(intVec.begin(), 
                                                         intVec.end(), 
                                                         AccumulateSquareValues&lt;int&gt;() );
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The sum of squares for 1-10 is &quot; &lt;&lt; sumOfSquare.Result() &lt;&lt; std::endl;

 // note: this problem can be solved in another, more clear way:
 // int sum_of_squares = std::inner_product(intVec.begin(), intVec.end(), intVec.begin(), 0);
&lt;/source&gt;

{{:C++ Programming/STL/Algorithms}}

===Allocators===
Allocators are used by the Standard C++ Library (and particularly by the STL) to allow parameterization of memory allocation strategies.  

The subject of allocators is somewhat obscure, and can safely be ignored by most application software developers.  All standard library constructs that allow for specification of an allocator have a default allocator which is used if none is given by the user.

Custom allocators can be useful if the memory use of a piece of code is unusual in a way that leads to performance problems if used with the general-purpose default allocator.  There are also other cases in which the default allocator is inappropriate, such as when using standard containers within an implementation of replacements for global operators new and delete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An option is a contract between two parties which gives a '''right''' to the buyer and an '''obligation''' to the seller. For example, a '''call option''' gives the buyer the right to buy a security at a certain price if he chooses and the seller the obligation to sell it at that price if the buyer chooses. The terms of all option contracts are standardized by the '''Options Clearing Corporation''' (OCC) to allow them to be traded on an exchange. Options may be based on stock, indexes, foreign currencies, interest rates, or bonds. 

The two type of option contracts are '''calls''' and '''puts'''. A buyer of a call has the right to buy a security at a certain price while the seller has an obligation to sell if the buyer chooses. A buyer of a put has a right to sell a security at a certain price to the seller of the put, who has an obligation to buy it if the buyer wants them to. A buyer of an option pays a premium to the seller in exchange for the sellers obligation. The seller of an option wants the contract to expire without the buyer exercising his rights. If this happens the seller gets to keep his premium without performing any obligation. The price where the buyer has the ability to exercise his rights to buy or sell is called the &quot;strike price&quot; 

For example, John owns 100 shares of XYZ which is currently at 60 dollars a share. He sells a call to Lucy which says he will agree to sell the stock to Lucy if the price is above 70 dollars a share. Almost all options have 9 months before they expire. Lucy pays for example 3 dollars a share to John for the right to buy XYZ at 70 dollars a share. If the stock price of XYZ moves above 70 dollars a share, Lucy can force John to sell the stock to her at 70 dollars a share even if the current price is 80 dollars a share. John wants the price to never go above 70 so he won't lose money from the sale and will now have a profit due to the premium he charged, while Lucy wants the price to go up above that amount so she can buy the stock at a discount below the current market value. 

A buyer of a call is called a &quot;long call&quot; while the seller is called a &quot;short call&quot;. The same applies to puts. This terminology is not related to being &quot;long or short&quot; a stock, and should simply be memorized as long being option buyer and short being option seller.   

Standard features of almost all options:
*Options last 9 months, and expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the last month at 11:59 PM Eastern time.
*Options based on stock are based on 100 shares of a particular stock.

The standard format for describing an option contract is as follows:

Long XYZ Feb 50 call at 2

The word &quot;long&quot; refers to the fact that this is the buyer of an option contract. XYZ is the stock symbol for the shares the option is based on. Feb refers to the expiration month of the contract. 50 refers to the strike price of the contraact. Call specifies that it is a call, &quot;at 2&quot; shows the premium paid for the contract.

''Option terminologies''

'''In the money''', an option is '''in the money''' if the market price of the security exceeds (in the case of calls), or is below (in the case of puts) the strike price. A buyer is able to exercise his rights when an option is in the money. Buyers want options to be in the money, sellers do not want this.

'''At the money''', an option is '''at the money''' where the market price equals the strike price. 

Finally, '''Out of the money''' is when the price of an optioned security is below (in the case of calls) or above (in the case of puts) the strike price.

'''Intrinsic Value''' is a somewhat confusing term. The intrinsic value is calculated based on the premium and takes into consideration the time value and/or volatility of the underlying security. It is calculated by examining the premium paid and subtracting the difference of the security in the money less the strike price less the option price, hence, if there is a value left over, this is considered the intrinsic value.  It does not take into consideration the premium paid. 

Option strategies

Straddle - Is when the investor is long a call and long a put or short a call and short a put in the same underlying security. The perceived thinking in entering into a straddle is based on volatility.

The buyer of the straddle is betting that the underlying security will move in large percentages within the expiration date of the options. The seller is betting that the security will not be volatile and aims to make  a profit off of the premiums received from selling(shorting,writng) the option contracts.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Nyarlathotep. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Nyarlathotep~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== The Windows 32 API ===
''Win32 API'' is a set of functions defined in the ''Windows OS'', in other words it is the '''Windows API''', this is the name given by ''Microsoft'' to the core set of [[w:application programming interface|application programming interface]]s available in the [[w:Microsoft Windows|Microsoft Windows]] [[w:operating systems|operating systems]]. It is designed for usage by [[w:C|C]]/[[w:C Plus Plus|C++]] programs and is the most direct way to interact with a ''Windows'' system for [[w:Application software|software applications]]. Lower level access to a ''Windows'' system, mostly required for [[w:device drivers|device drivers]], is provided by the [[w:Windows Driver Model|Windows Driver Model]] in current versions of ''Windows''.

One can get more information about the ''API'' and support from ''Microsoft'' itself, using the MSDN Library ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/ ) essentially a resource for developers using Microsoft tools, products, and technologies. It contains a bounty of technical programming information, including sample code, documentation, technical articles, and reference guides. You can also check out Wikibooks [[Windows Programming]] book for some more detailed information that goes beyond the scope of this book.

A [[w:software development kit|software development kit]] (SDK) is available for ''Windows'', which provides documentation and tools to enable developers to create software using the ''Windows API'' and associated ''Windows'' technologies.
( http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/ )

; History 
The Windows API has always exposed a large part of the underlying structure of the various Windows systems for which it has been built to the programmer. This has had the advantage of giving Windows programmers a great deal of flexibility and power over their applications. However, it also has given Windows applications a great deal of responsibility in handling various low-level, sometimes tedious, operations that are associated with a [[w:Graphical user interface|Graphical user interface]].

[[w:Charles Petzold|Charles Petzold]], writer of various well read Windows API books, has said: ''&quot;The original hello-world program in the Windows 1.0 SDK was a bit of a scandal. HELLO.C was about 150 lines long, and the HELLO.RC resource script had another 20 or so more lines. (...) Veteran C programmers often curled up in horror or laughter when encountering the Windows hello-world program.&quot;''. A [[w:hello world program|hello world program]] is a often used programming example, usually designed to show the easiest possible application on a system that can actually do something (i.e. print a line that says &quot;Hello World&quot;).

Over the years, various changes and additions were made to the Windows Operating System, and the Windows API changed and grew to reflect this. The windows API for [[w:Windows 1.0|Windows 1.0]] supported less than 450 [[w:Subroutine|function calls]], where in modern versions of the Windows API there are thousands. In general, the interface has remained fairly consistent however, and a old Windows 1.0 application will still look familiar to a programmer who is used to the modern Windows API.

A large emphasis has been put by [[w:Microsoft|Microsoft]] on maintaining software [[w:backwards compatibility|backwards compatibility]]. To achieve this, Microsoft sometimes went as far as supporting software that was using the API in a undocumented or even (programmatically) illegal way. [[w:Raymond Chen|Raymond Chen]], a Microsoft developer who works on the Windows API, has said that he ''&quot;could probably write for months solely about bad things apps do and what we had to do to get them to work again (often in spite of themselves). Which is why I get particularly furious when people accuse Microsoft of maliciously breaking applications during OS upgrades. If any application failed to run on Windows 95, I took it as a personal failure.&quot;''

==== Variables and &lt;u&gt;Win32&lt;/u&gt;====
'''Win32''' uses an extended set of data types, using C's typedef mechanism These include:
*BYTE - {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} 8 bit integer.
*DWORD -	32 bit {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} integer.
*LONG - 32 bit signed integer.
*LPDWORD - 32 bit pointer to DWORD.
*LPCSTR - 32 bit pointer to constant character string.
*LPSTR -	32 bit pointer to character string.
*UINT - 32 bit {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} int.
*WORD - 16 bit {{C++ Programming/kw|unsigned}} int.
*HANDLE - opaque pointer to system data.

Of course standard data types are also available when programming with '''Win32 API'''.

==== Windows Libraries (DLLs) ====
In Windows, library code exists in  a number of forms, and can be accessed in various ways.

Normally, the only thing that is needed is to include in the appropriate header file on the source code the information to the compiler, and linking  to the .lib file will occur during the linking phase.

This .lib file either contains code which is to be statically linked into compiled object code
or contains code to allow access to a dynamically link to a binary library(.DLL) on the system.

It is also possible to generate a binary library .DLL within C++ by including appropriate
information such as an import/export table when compiling and linking.

DLLs stand for Dynamic Link Libraries, the basic file of functions that are used in some programs. Many newer C++ IDEs such as Dev-CPP support such libraries.

Common libraries on Windows include those provided by the Platform Software Development Kit,
Microsoft Foundation Class and a C++ interface to .Net Framework assemblies.

Although not strictly use as library code, the Platform SDK and other libraries provide a set of standardized interfaces to objects accessible via the [[w:Component Object Model|Component Object Model]] implemented as part of 
Windows. 

{{TODO| Add '''Registry''', '''IO (Input/Output)''', '''Security''', '''Processes and Threads'''|C++ Programming}}

==== API conventions and Win32 API Functions (by focus) ====

===== Time =====
Time measurement has to come from the OS in relation to the hardware it is run, unfortunately  most computers don't have a standard high-accuracy, high-precision time clock that is also quick to access.

MSDN Time Functions ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/time_functions.asp )

Timer Function Performance ( http://developer.nvidia.com/object/timer_function_performance.html )

'''GetTickCount''' has a precision (dependent on your timer tick rate) of one millisecond, its accuracy typically within a 10-55ms expected error, the best thing is that it increments at a constant rate. (''WaitForSingleObject'' uses the same timer).

'''GetSystemTimeAsFileTime''' has a precision of 100-nanoseconds, its accuracy is similar to ''GetTickCount''.

'''QueryPerformanceCounter''' can be slower to obtain but has higher accuracy, uses the HAL (with some help from ACPI) a problem with it is that it can travel back in time on over-clocked PCs due to garbage on the LSBs, note that  the functions fail unless the supplied LARGE_INTEGER is DWORD aligned.

Performance counter value may unexpectedly leap forward ( http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q274323&amp; )

'''timeGetTime''' (via winmm.dll) has a precision of ~5ms.

===== File System =====
'''MakeSureDirectoryPathExists''' (via Image Help Library - IMAGHLP.DLL, &lt;tt&gt;#pragma comment( lib, &quot;imagehlp.lib&quot; )&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;#include &lt;imagehlp.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; ) creates directories, only useful to create/force the existence of a given dir tree or multiple directories, or if the linking is already present, note that it is single threaded.

{{TODO| Add '''Basics in building &quot;windows&quot;''', '''Window eventhandling''', '''Resources'''|C++ Programming}}

===== Network =====
Network applications are often built in C++ on windows utilizing the WinSock API functions.

==== Resources ====
Resources files are perhaps one of the most useful elements included on the WIN32 API, they are how we program menu's, add icons, backgrounds, music and many more aesthetically pleasing elements to our programs. Sadly the use in compilation use of resource files is today to those using the MS Visual Studio IDE (resource editor, resource structure understanding).

{{NOTE|This is similar to the approach of the QT library in dealing with GUI elements, but in this case the OS programing API has direct support for the handling of the resource elements.}}   

The resources are defined in a .rc file (resource c) and are included at the linking phase of compile. Resource files work hand in hand with a header file (usually called resource.h) which carries the definitions of each ID.

For example a simple RC file might contain a menu:

&lt;pre&gt;
//////////////
IDR_MYMENU MENU
BEGIN
    POPUP &quot;&amp;File&quot;
    BEGIN

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MFC Classes Hierarchy ==

==== CObject ====
The root/base class for most of the MFC libary. Some of the features it makes available to the programmer are serialization support, run-time class information, and object diagnostic output. Any derived class from CObject, can exploit these features.

'''Class CObject''' ''in AFX.H''

Field Summary 
 static const AFX_CORE_DATA CRuntimeClass classCObject 
           
Constructor Summary 
 protected  CObject() 
           
 private  CObject( const CObject&amp; objectSrc ) 
           
  virtual ~CObject() 


Method Summary 
 void PASCAL operator delete( void* p ) 
           
 virtual CRuntimeClass* GetRuntimeClass() const 
           
 BOOL IsKindOf( const CRuntimeClass* pClass ) const 
           
 BOOL IsSerializable() const 
           
 void* PASCAL operator new( size_t, void* p ) 
           
 void* PASCAL operator new( size_t nSize ) 
           
 virtual void Serialize( CArchive&amp; ar )

==== CCmdTarget ==== 
==== CWinThread ==== 
==== CWinApp ==== 
==== CWnd ==== 
==== CListCtrl ==== 
This class encapsulates the functionality of a list view control, which is a control that displays a collection of items, each consisting of an icon and a label.

Class '''CListCtrl''' ''in AFXCMN.H''

==== CToolBar ==== 
This class encapsulates the functionality of a control bars that have a row of bitmapped buttons and/or separators. CToolBar objects are usually embedded members of frame-window objects derived from the class CFrameWnd or MDIFrameWnd.

==== CTreeCtrl ====

==== CHttpArgList ====

=== Subclassing ===

standard technique for customizing the behavior of a class

==== Window Subclassing ====

=== Window message route ===
The mechanism by which MFC routes messages is also called the Message Map system that was created to wrap the old C API and reduce the level of complexity for programmers.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// a Message Map example

BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP( ClNOMainFrameWnd, CFrameWnd )
  ON_WM_SYSCOMMAND()
  ON_WM_CREATE()
  ON_WM_SIZE()
  ON_WM_CLOSE()
  ON_WM_MEASUREITEM()
  ON_WM_INITMENUPOPUP()
  ON_WM_MENUCHAR()
  ON_WM_DESTROY()

  ON_REGISTERED_MESSAGE( D_WM_REQUEST, OnMsgReqToShowWnd )

  ON_COMMAND( ID_APP_TRAYCLICK, OnTrayClick )
  ON_MESSAGE( C_WM_TIPACTION, OnTipOfTheDayAction )

END_MESSAGE_MAP()
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Message map ====

The message map macros:

; ON_COMMAND and ON_BN_CLICKED :  the ON_COMMAND and ON_BN_CLICKED are the same, MFC command and control macro is preset to handle the Windows message WM_COMMAND and the notification routing mechanism uses the command ID to decide where to route to. Notifications with control notification code of zero (BN_CLICKED) are interpreted as commands.

; ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI : the ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI macro.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

==Text Blocks==
A Blender document can contain ''text blocks'', which are not the same as ''text objects'' in a 3D scene (though the former can be converted to the latter). Besides generating text objects, a text block can serve any purpose you like; for example, use it to pass workflow instructions to a colleague along with the document; display a copyright or help message in the initial layout that a user sees on opening the document; or hold a Python script that can be run by the user to perform some useful action related to the document.

Text blocks are edited in the Text Editor window. The Text Editor also provides commands to load the contents of a text block from an external file, or save it to an external file. And also execute the text as a Python script.

==Your First Script==
Open a new, default Blender document. Split the 3D View in two vertically. Change the type of one side to a Text Editor window. In the header, you will see a small popup menu showing just a double-headed arrow; click on this, and it should show three items: “Text”, “ADD NEW” and “OPEN NEW”. “ADD NEW” creates a new, empty text block, while “OPEN NEW” creates a new text block by reading its contents from an external file. But “Text” is already the name of a default empty text block, so just use that; as soon as you select it, you should see a red insertion cursor appear at the top left, indicating that you can start typing.

Unlike the Interactive Python Console, nothing is automatically imported for you. So as in any other Python script, you need to mention every module you want to access.

Let us write a script that inserts a new mesh primitive into a Blender document, namely a tetrahedron. First we need to create a new mesh datablock, which we will name “Tetrahedron”:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
NewMesh = Blender.Mesh.New(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Then we need to define the coordinates of the vertices; for a tetrahedron with edges of length 1 Blender unit, suitable values are &lt;math&gt;(0, - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(- \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}, 0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(0, 0, \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}})&lt;/math&gt;. Or in Python:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
NewMesh.verts.extend \
  (
    [
        (0, -1 / math.sqrt(3),0),
        (0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0),
        (-0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0),
        (0, 0, math.sqrt(2 / 3)),
    ]
  )
&lt;/source&gt;

We also need to define the faces of the object; each face is defined by listing a sequence of indexes into the above array of vertices (you don’t need to bother about defining the edges; Blender will deduce them from the faces):
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
NewMesh.faces.extend \
  (
    [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 3]]
  )
&lt;/source&gt;
That suffices for the mesh, now we create an actual object datablock that will appear in the scene (which we also name “Tetrahedron”):
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
TheObj = Blender.Object.New(&quot;Mesh&quot;, &quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
Link it to the mesh we just made:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
TheObj.link(NewMesh)
&lt;/source&gt;
And to make the object appear in the scene, it has to be linked to it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
TheScene = Blender.Scene.GetCurrent()
TheScene.link(TheObj)
&lt;/source&gt;
And finally, tell Blender that the scene has changed:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
TheScene.update()
&lt;/source&gt;
and to redraw the 3D view to show the updated scene:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Blender.Window.Redraw()
&lt;/source&gt;

==Put It All Together==
Your complete script should look like this, including the imports of the referenced &lt;TT&gt;math&lt;/TT&gt; and &lt;TT&gt;Blender&lt;/TT&gt; modules; note also the use of the directive to ensure that the “/” operator always returns a real, not an integer, result; this is good practice with Python 2.''x'', since it becomes mandatory behaviour beginning with Python 3.0.
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
from __future__ import division
import math
import Blender

NewMesh = Blender.Mesh.New(&quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
NewMesh.verts.extend \
  (
    [
        (0, -1 / math.sqrt(3),0),
        (0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0),
        (-0.5, 1 / (2 * math.sqrt(3)), 0),
        (0, 0, math.sqrt(2 / 3)),
    ]
  )
NewMesh.faces.extend \
  (
    [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 3]]
  )
TheObj = Blender.Object.New(&quot;Mesh&quot;, &quot;Tetrahedron&quot;)
TheObj.link(NewMesh)
TheScene = Blender.Scene.GetCurrent()
TheScene.link(TheObj)
TheScene.update()
Blender.Window.Redraw()
&lt;/source&gt;
In your 3D View, get rid of any default cube to avoid it obscuring things. Now come back to the Text Editor window showing the above script, and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|ALT|P}} to execute it; you should see your new tetrahedron appear in the 3D view!

==If You Hit An Error==
If there is any error running the script, Blender will display a cryptic message to let you know. For example, the following simple one-line script
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
raise RuntimeError(&quot;Uh-oh&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
displays this message:
[[File:Blender249ScriptErrorMsg.png|center]]
To get more details you will have to look in Standard Error; on Linux/Unix systems, the message will appear in the terminal session if you invoked Blender from the command line; otherwise it will be appended to your &lt;TT&gt;~/.xsessionerrors&lt;/TT&gt; file if you launched Blender from a GUI. On Windows the message appears in the console window. By hunting around in the appropriate place, you should be able to find the full Python traceback:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;Text.001&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
RuntimeError: Uh-oh
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''microgram''' is a unit of weight. It is abbreviated '''&amp;micro;g''', (or sometimes '''mcg''' but this is not approved by the Société Internationale (SI)).  It is equal to one thousandth (0.001) of a [[Cookbook:mg|milligram]], and one millionth (0.000001) of a [[Cookbook:g|gram]]. It is included here for information purposes only as it has no use in cooking outside of scientific analysis of micronutrients in foodstuffs.

==Note==
* '''mg''' is the symbol for '''milligram'''. It may NEVER be used as an abbreviation for microgram. If misused in this manner in a pharmaceutical or medical setting, it could cause '''serious injury''' or '''death'''.</text>

'''Duck Confit'''

== Ingredients ==
* 4 [[cookbook:duck|duck]] leg portions with thighs attached, (about 2 pounds) excess fat trimmed and reserved
* 1 tablespoon plus ⅛ teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 10 [[cookbook:garlic|garlic]] cloves
* 4 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
* 4 sprigs fresh [[cookbook:thyme|thyme]]
* 1½ teaspoon black [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppercorns]]
* ½ teaspoon table [[cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 4 cups [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]

== Procedure ==
# Lay the leg portions on a platter, skin side down. 
# Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of the salt and the black pepper. 
# Place the garlic cloves, bay leaves, and sprigs of thyme on each of 2 leg portions. 
# Lay the remaining 2 leg portions, flesh to flesh, on top. 
# Put the fat from the ducks in the bottom of a glass or plastic container. 
# Top with the sandwiched leg portions. 
# Sprinkle with the remaining ⅛ teaspoon salt. 
# Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours.
# Preheat the oven to 200°F (95°C).
# Remove the duck from the refrigerator. 
# Remove the garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and duck fat and set aside. 
# Rinse the duck with cool water, rubbing off some of the salt and pepper. 
# Pat dry with paper towels.
# Put the garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and duck fat in the bottom of an enamelled cast iron pot. 
# Sprinkle evenly with the peppercorns and table salt. 
# Lay the duck on top, skin side down. 
# Add the olive oil. 
# Cover and [[cookbook:bake|bake]] for 12 to 14 hours, or until the meat pulls away from the bone.
# Remove the duck from the fat. 
# Strain the fat and set aside. 
# To store the duck confit, place the duck leg portions in a container, cover with the cooking fat, and store in the refrigerator. 
# Alternately, pick the meat from the bones and place it in a stoneware container. 
# Cover the meat with a thin layer of some of the strained fat. 
# The duck confit can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.

The excess oil can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator and used like [[cookbook:butter|butter]] for cooking. The tinge of duck taste in the oil is wonderful.

A pork recipe loosely based on kerala cooking.

==Ingredients==
*500 [[Cookbook:Gram|grams]] [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]], diced
* 4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut oil]] 
* 1/2 of a medium sized [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely sliced            
* 3 [[Cookbook:Chili pepper|green chili peppers]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (or ginger paste)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (or garlic paste)
* 1 [[Cookbook:Pork|pork stock cube]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] ready-to-mix [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] mash
* 4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] meat masala powder

==Procedure==
#Brown the meat in two spoons of coconut oil, add 2 spoons of meat masala powder and [[Cookbook:Fry|fry]] for a minute. 
#Add a spoon of vinegar and fry for a minute more. Add a cup of water and cook till the meat is about half done.
#Sauté the sliced onions with 2 table spoon coconut oil in a wok or a suitable vessel along with the chopped chillies in medium flame.
#Add the ginger and garlic after about 4 minutes. Keep stir frying for about 3 more minutes. 
#Add 2 tea spoons of meat masala powder and mix it with the rest until the onions are translucent.
#Add the beef stock cube and 1/4 glass of water, keeping on low flame for around 4 minutes. Keep adding a bit of water as necessary to make sure that the paste mix does not stick to the bottom of the vessel/wok.
#Add the half-cooked meat and mix well. Keep on medium flame till the meat is cooked thoroughly.
#Add 1/4 of a cup of water and the potato flakes/powder and mixture. You can vary the amount of the water/potato mix to desired thickness of the dish.
#Remove from fire and hold for 3-5 minutes before serving.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Keep adding water as necessary to prevent the mix from sticking to the bottom of the pan. The longer the onions are sautéed in oil in medium flame, the softer they become and the tastier they will be.
*If you can not get the mashed potato mix, thoroughly boil potatoes in water and use a spoon or a ladle to mash them.
*If you are using beef stock, there is no need to add more salt. Otherwise add salt to your taste. Beef stock may contain Mono Sodium Glutamate and hence would not be suitable for everyone.
*The chillies used in the above preparation are mild green chillies about the length of around 5 inches.
*The onions used should be the size of a tennis ball.
*You can also microwave the pork on full power (850W) for about 15 minutes, stirring at regular intervals of 5 minutes instead of cooking it.

[[User:Josephsukhbir|Josephsukhbir]] 17:12, 29 August 2005 (UTC) I have been reading the templates and using them.
: I saw, thanks. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:17, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

[[User:Josephsukhbir|Josephsukhbir]] 18:53, 29 August 2005 (UTC) Can you point me to a good template for the main page of the cookbook?
: I'm not sure what you're asking for here. 
:* If you're asking about recipes, there's the [[Cookbook:Policy/Recipe template]] for recipe formatting. 
:* If you're asking about what to do to modify they [[Cookbook|front page]]; it's pretty open, just follow the normal conventions there. I'm not sure what you might add to it though, as the &quot;National and Ethnic Cuisines&quot; section is pretty high-level. 
:* If you're asking about the featured recipe and ingredient, see the note at [[Talk:Cookbook]], but these were changed not more than a day or two ago, so at least wait a while (the general rule is not more than once per week). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:07, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

[[User:Josephsukhbir|Josephsukhbir]] 19:05, 29 August 2005 (UTC)Should I create two pages? One about the cuisine and the other with just the recipes? Or leave it as is?
: If you're going to have a user-maintained list, then the preferred method is to have them on the same page. Category listings are better, so if you wanted to create [[:Category:Trinidadian and Tobagonian recipes]] and categorize it under [[:Category:Caribbean recipes]], this would be better. There is also some discussion on [[Talk:Cookbook]] about doing away with the &quot;normal&quot; pages like this and making everything category-based.

Sometimes we will write, for a relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;xRy&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R&lt;/math&gt;. In this chapter we will deal with ordering -- relations with special properties  and we will denote these relations usally &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, the definition of ordering reminds properties of the usual relation &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; on numbers.

A relation ''R'' on set ''A'' is called
*reflexive iff ''aRa'' for any &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;;
*antisymmetric iff if ''aRb'' and ''bRa'' implies ''a'' = ''b'' for any &lt;math&gt;a,b\in A&lt;/math&gt;; 
*transitive iff ''aRb'' and ''bRc'' implies ''aRc'' for any &lt;math&gt;a,b\in A&lt;/math&gt;.


''partial order''

Note about weak &lt; and strict partial order.

''totally ordered set'' ''linearly ordered set'' (total order, linear order), ''chain''

''antichain''

Examples: &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt;, |

''minimal element''

''smallest element''

''well-ordering''

[[File:Blender3D SimpleParticleFire.ogv|framed|'''Figure 1:''' My idea of particle fire.]]
We're going to create a camp fire with a simple particle system. This tutorial is based on the method described in the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Physics/Particles Blender Manual]. The result of this tutorial is shown in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;1''', the Blend-File is included at the bottom of this page.

If you need more realistic looking fire, you should use the method described in [http://www.blenderart.org/issues/ BlenderArt Magazine No. 16], though that method is more advanced and uses Compositing Nodes heavily. 

The starting point of the tutorial is how fire behaves physically. The flames are made of hot gases. These accelerate upwards due to their lower density in contrast to the cooler air in the environment. Flames are in the middle hot and bright, to the outside they are darker.
{{clear}}

== The particle system ==
[[File:Blender3D SimpleFireSetup-2.48a.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Figure 2a:''' A simple scene]]
I've created the usual scene with some stones and a few pieces of wood (the wood is by courtesy of Teeth). ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;2a'''). 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|'''Noob note:''' I made the stones by adding an Icosphere of 3 subdivisions, and then used the proportional edit falloff ('''OKey''') with the random falloff mode. And then subdivide and smooth.
|-
|'''Noob note 2:''' For the wood I used a modified Plane with an Image texture created with '''GIMP'''
|}
* Add a ''Plane'' in the middle of the stones.
This will become the particle emitter.
* Rename the ''Plane'' object to &quot;Emitter&quot;.
If you use good names you will find it much easier to orientate yourself in your scene later. Having 100 objects named &quot;Cube.something&quot; will make it very difficult to quickly select a desired object.
* Subdivide the plane once in ''Edit'' mode.
* Change the shape of the plane, so that it's shape equals the base of the fire.
* Change to object mode.
{{clear}}
[[File:Blender3D SimpleFireParticleSystem-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 2b:''' The particle system]]
* Change to the ''Particle'' buttons of the ''Object'' buttons.
* Create a particle systems (''Add New'' in the ''Particle System'' panel - and make sure the plane is selected!).
* ''Type: Emitter'' The plane emits the particles.
** ''Amount:'' 9000 The total amount of particles.
** ''Sta:'' -45 The simulation shall start before the rendering, to have a fully developed flame in the first frame.
** ''End:'' 200 The simulation shall last 200 frames - here: the particles are emitted till frame 200.
** ''Life:'' 16.6 I've adjusted the lifetime of the particles to their speed. Both parameters together regulate the hight of the flame.
** ''Rand:'' 0.5 The lifetime is changed randomly.
* ''Emit from:'' 
** ''Random''
** ''Faces''
** ''Even''
** ''Random''
This creates particles with a random distribution on the faces of the emitter object.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Please note, that the particle simulation is only fully calculated if the bake parameters in the ''Bake'' panel match the positive lifetime of the particles. If you want to run the simulation longer than 250 frames, you have to increase the ''End'' frame in the ''Bake'' panel as well. This is independent whether you want to bake or not.}}

The movement of the particles is controlled with particle physics. You set the ''Initial Velocity'' and let the physics do the rest. 
* ''Normal:'' -0.099 The particles are emitted slightly against the direction of the face normal. This leads to a bit wider fire at the base.
* ''Random:'' 0.014 This creates a random start velocity as well in speed as in direction (you could use a texture to randomize only the speed, see the discussion page for that).
After you have given the particles an initial velocity they are moved by forces.
* ''AccZ:'' 2.57 A force in positive Z direction (upwards).

{{B3D:N2P/Note|As far as I can see AccZ does not exist in later versions(2.69 in my case); the alternative appears to be to set the ''Physics'' to ''Fluid'' and set a positive Buoyancy (something around 0.75 looks reasonable).}}

* ''Drag:'' 0.1 Air drag decelerates the particles.
* ''Brown:'' 1.99 Random movement simulates agitated air movement.
{{clear}}
[[File:Blender3D SimpleFireNoMaterial-2.48a.jpg|thumb|200px|'''Figure 2c:''' Particles without material]]
The particle system is finished. Until now is doesn't look like much (see the white Blob in '''Fig.&amp;nbsp;2c'''). Therefore the emitter will get a material, this material will be animated.

{{clear}}

== Material ==
[[File:Blender3D SimpleFireMaterial-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 3a:''' Material for the emitter object.]]
* Create a new material for the emitter, call the material ''Flames''.
* Activate the ''Halo'' button in the ''Links and Pipeline'' panel. Else we couldn't set the particle parameters. The particles would be rendered with the default Halo values.
* ''Halo'' color: 1/0/0 (red)
* ''Alpha:'' 0.8 The particles shall always be a bit transparent.
* ''HaloSize:'' 0.132 I wanted many, but fairly small particles.
* ''Hard:'' 45 The transition from fully transparent to fully opaque.
* ''Add:'' 0.875 Several ''Halos'' over each other combine their power. This makes the fire in the center really bright.
* ''HaloTex:'' A Halo can bear an individual texture, but only the texture in the first texture slot is evaluated.
To give the Halo a bit more structure, give it a texture:
* Add a new texture in the first texture slot.
* ''Map To:'' 
** ''Col''
** Color: Bright yellow (1/1/0.664)
{{clear}}
[[File:Blender3D Lagerfeuer Textur.png|thumb|600px|'''Figure 3b:''' Adjusted texture]]
* Use an adjusted ''Clouds'' texture with a ''NoiseSize'' of 0.6.

{{clear}}
=== Animation of the particle material ===
[[File:Blender3D SimpleFireMaterialAnimation-2.48a.png|framed|'''Figure 3c:''' Animation of the ''Alpha'' value]]
The particles &quot;pop&quot; into life and vanish suddenly. We should change that. Therefore we're going to animate the ''Alpha'' value of the particles. 

* Make sure the material buttons are visible in the buttons window.
* Change to frame 21, move the mouse cursor over the button window and press '''I'''-&gt;''Alpha''. This is going to be the maximum visibility of the particles. 
* Change to frame 1. Change the ''Alpha'' value to 0 and insert the next key.
* Change to frame 100. Change the ''Alpha'' value to 0 again and insert the third key.

If you want to see the IPO curve in the ''IPO Editor'' window you must change the ''IPO Type'' selector in the window header from ''Object'' to ''Material''. 

{{B3D:N2P/Note|''Note:'' An animation of particle material is mapped from the first 100 frames to the lifetime of the particles. I.e. if the material is faded out during the first 100 frames (the ipo curve is 100 frames long) the particle will be faded out during it's own lifetime, no matter how long that is. This holds true however only for ''Point'' visualization of particles, not for object visualization.}}
The ''Alpha'' value therefore changes during the individual lifetime of each particle from 0 to 0.8 and back to 0 ('''Fig.&amp;nbsp;3c''').

{{clear}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|''Note:'' In Blender 2.6, IPO curves no longer exist. Select the graph editor view to get the same capabilities. Also note that in the texture settings from the previous section you need to enable (and set to 1) the Alpha setting in the &quot;influence&quot; section, otherwise the Alpha animation will be applied to the particle system as a whole not to the individual particles.}}
{{clear}}

== Rendering ==
Our particle animation is finished. 
* Change the end frame in the ''Anim'' panel of the rendering Buttons to 200 and click on ''Anim''.
'''Note: If after rendering your particles are too small, such that the fire doesn't look realistic, try increasing the ''Halo size'' slightly. I used 0.300 instead of 0.132'''

To actually let the fire glow you have to use one or more lamps and animate them  as well. But that would be part of another tutorial ...

Commons is in fact very convenient - you don't need to upload anything! Just search Commons - most of graphics from Wikipedias are there. I suggest you find these flags at Commons (just type &quot;Montenegro&quot; or &quot;Serbia&quot; in search box and you'll get a gallery of graphics connected with these countries, flag would be first of them) and use them instead of these you have uploaded. If you don't use graphics you have uploaded, insert {{tl|delete}} or {{tl|NowCommons}} to their description page and I will delete them.

Have fun working at Wikibooks! --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 19:48, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

:The coolest thing in Commons is that every image there is seen as it was uploaded here. You just type &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:xyz.png|150px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and it works! --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 19:54, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

:If you just want to let everybody use the images for any reason, mark it '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{PD-self}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to put it into the public domain. (or, as near as possible for the laws of your country) This disclaims copyright. It's about the same as sharing copyright with everyone else in the world.

== [[Wikiversity:School of Magic]] ==

It seems that I have stumbled upon this school during the very inklings of its development.  Any estimate on when materials might begin being submitted / when classes might be starting?

Also, if you are looking for help, I can't guarantee I can dedicate a lot of time, but I am a journeyman wizard, so I might be able to assist in some areas that I have found myself to be strong in...

[[user: Black_Dagger|Caspian]]
[[user_talk: Black_Dagger|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]]

== Classes ==

I'm interested in taking all the classes, actually.  I'm currently working through Oberon Zell-Ravenheart's book &quot;Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard&quot; which has contributions from other members of the Grey Council of Wizards (including such illustrious names as Ray Buckland, Raven Grimassi, Patricia Telesco, and Donald Michael Kraig among others).  Although some of the information is below my level of understanding since I've been a student and practitioner of magic for about 10 years now, it's the first book I've found presented as a logical course-study that has allowed me to actually figure out what areas I'm really lacking in and which ones I've progressed strongly in.

I'm really new to Wiki so it may take me some time to get used to it all, but I would be more than happy to teach some courses in Ritual Magic, as that is one area I am quite knowledgable about.

[[user: Black_Dagger|Caspian]][[user_talk: Black_Dagger|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]]

== Re: Tests and quizzes ==

Hi there, I don't know how to enable tests or quizzes - I think you would be better off asking technical people at either the developers' mailing list [http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l wikitech-l], or on IRC, channel #mediawiki. I would warn however that developers might not be so keen to help, as the official position on Wikiversity is still to &quot;exclude online courses&quot;. Still, this remains in debate, so there's nothing stopping you from trying - good luck! [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 12:51, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:49, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ђорђе Д. Божовић. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ђорђе Д. Божовић~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Operators ==
Now that we have covered the '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables|variables]]''''' and '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type|data types]]''''' it becomes possible to introduce '''operators'''. '''Operators''' are special symbols that are used to represent and direct simple computations, this is significative importance in programming, since they serve to define, in a very direct, non-abtractive way and simple way, actions and simple interaction with data.

Since computers are mathematical devices, [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler|compilers]] and [[w:interpreter|interpreters]] require a full syntactic theory of all operations in order to parse formulas involving any combinations correctly. In particular they depend on [[w:operator precedence|operator precedence]] rules, on [[w:order of operations|order of operations]], that are tacitly assumed in mathematical writing and the same applies to programming languages.
Conventionally, the computing usage of ''operator'' also goes beyond the [[w:operator|mathematical usage]] (for functions).

C++ like all [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages|programming languages]] uses a set of operators, they are subdivided into several groups:
* arithmetic operators (like addition and multiplication).
* boolean operators.
* string operators (used to manipulate [[w:literal string|strings of text]]).
* pointer operators.
* named operators (operators such as {{C++ Programming/kw|sizeof}}, &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;delete&lt;/tt&gt; defined by alphanumeric  names rather than a punctuation character). 

Most of the operators in C++ do exactly what you would expect them to do, because most are common mathematical symbols. For example, the operator for adding two integers is +. C++ does allows the re-definition of some operators ([[C++ Programming/Operators/Operator Overloading|operator overloading]]) on more complex types, this will be covered later on.

Expressions can contain both variables names and integer values. In each case the name of the variable is replaced with its value before the computation is performed.

=== Order of operations ===
When more than one operator appears in an expression the order of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence. A complete explanation of precedence can get complicated, but just to get you started:

Multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction. So 2*3-1 yields 5, not 4, and 2/3-1 yields -1, not 1 (remember that in integer division 2/3 is 0). 
If the operators have the same precedence they are evaluated from left to right. So in the expression minute*100/60, the multiplication happens first, yielding 5900/60, which in turn yields 98. If the operations had gone from right to left, the result would be 59*1 which is 59, which is wrong. 
Any time you want to override the rules of precedence (or you are not sure what they are) you can use parentheses. Expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, so 2 * (3-1) is 4. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even though it doesn't change the result.

=== [[w:Operator precedence|Precedence]] (Composition) ===
At this point we have looked at some of the elements of a programming language like variables, expressions, and statements in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.

One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and compose them (solving big problems by taking small steps at a  time). For example, we know how to multiply integers and we know how to output values; it turns out we can do both at the same time:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::cout &lt;&lt; 17 * 3; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Actually, I shouldn't say &quot;at the same time,&quot; since in reality the multiplication has to happen before the output, but the point is that any expression, involving numbers, characters, and variables, can be used inside an output statement. We've already seen one example:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::cout &lt;&lt; hour * 60 + minute &lt;&lt; std::endl; 
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also put arbitrary expressions on the right-hand side of an assignment statement:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int percentage; 
percentage = ( minute * 100 ) / 60; 
&lt;/source&gt;

This ability may not seem so impressive now, but we will see other examples where composition makes it possible to express complex computations neatly and concisely.

{{NOTE|There are limits on where you can use certain expressions; most notably, the left-hand side of an assignment statement (normally) has to be a variable name, not an expression. That's because the left side indicates the storage location where the result will go. Expressions do not represent storage locations, only values.}}

The following is illegal:&lt;source lang=cpp&gt; minute+1 = hour;&lt;/source&gt;

The exact rule for what can go on the left-hand side of an assignment expression is not so simple as it was in C; as  [[w:operator overloading|operator overloading]] and reference types can complicate the picture.
{{:C++ Programming/Operators/Chaining}}
{{:C++ Programming/Operators Table}}

=== Assignment ===
The most basic assignment operator is the &quot;=&quot; operator. It assigns one variable to have the value of another. For instance, the statement &lt;tt&gt;x = 3&lt;/tt&gt; assigns &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; the value of 3, and &lt;tt&gt;y = x&lt;/tt&gt; assigns whatever was in &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; to be in &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt;. When the &quot;=&quot; operator is used to assign a class or struct, it acts like using the &quot;=&quot; operator on every single element. For instance:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
//Example to demonstrate default &quot;=&quot; operator behavior.

struct A
 {
  int i;
  float f;
  A * next_a;
 };

//Inside some function
 {
  A a1, a2;              // Create two A objects.

  a1.i = 3;              // Assign 3 to i of a1.
  a1.f = 4.5;            // Assign the value of 4.5 to f in a1
  a1.next_a = &amp;a2;       // a1.next_a now points to a2

  a2.next_a = NULL;      // a2.next_a is guaranteed to point at nothing now.
  a2.i = a1.i;           // Copy over a1.i, so that a2.i is now 3.
  a1.next_a = a2.next_a; // Now a1.next_a is NULL

  a2 = a1;               // Copy a1 to a2, so that now a2.f is 4.5. The other two are unchanged, since they were the same.
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Assignments can also be chained since the assignment operator returns the value it assigns. But this time the chaining is from right to left. For example, to assign the value of &lt;tt&gt;z&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; and assign the same value (which is returned by the &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; operator) to &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; you use:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
x = y = z;
&lt;/source&gt;

When the &quot;=&quot; operator is used in a declaration, it has special meaning. It tells the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler|compiler]] to directly initialize the variable from whatever is on the right-hand side of the operator. This is called defining a variable, in the same way that you define a class or a function. With classes, this can make a difference, especially when assigning to a function call:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class A { /* ... */ };
A foo () { /* ... */ };

// In some function
 {
  A a;
  a = foo();

  A a2 = foo();
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

In the first case, &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; is constructed, then is changed by the &quot;=&quot; operator. In the second statement, &lt;tt&gt;a2&lt;/tt&gt; is constructed directly from the return value of &lt;tt&gt;foo()&lt;/tt&gt;. In many cases, the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler|compiler]] can save a lot of time by constructing &lt;tt&gt;foo()&lt;/tt&gt;'s return value directly into &lt;tt&gt;a2&lt;/tt&gt;'s memory, which makes the program run faster.

Whether or not you define can also matter in a few cases where a definition can result in different linkage, making the variable more or less available to other source files.

=== Arithmetic operators ===
Arithmetic operations that can be performed on integers (also common in many other languages) include:

* Addition, using the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator
* Subtraction, using the &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; operator
* Multiplication, using the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; operator
* Division, using the &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; operator
* Remainder, using the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; operator

Consider the next example, it will perform an addition and show the result:
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators/Examples/Adding Integer Numbers}}

The line relevant for the operation is where the &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; operator adds the values stored in the locations &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt; are said to be the ''operands'' of &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;. The combination &lt;tt&gt;a + b&lt;/tt&gt; is called an ''expression'', specifically an ''arithmetic expression'' since &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; is an ''arithmetic operator''. 

Addition, subtraction and multiplication all do what you expect, but you might be surprised by division. For example, the following program:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int hour, minute; 
hour = 11; 
minute = 59; 
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Number of minutes since midnight: &quot;; 
std::cout &lt;&lt; hour*60 + minute &lt;&lt; std::endl; 
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Fraction of the hour that has passed: &quot;; 
std::cout &lt;&lt; minute/60 &lt;&lt; std::endl; 
&lt;/source&gt;

would generate the following output:

&lt;tt&gt;Number of minutes since midnight: 719&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;tt&gt;Fraction of the hour that has passed: 0&lt;/tt&gt;

The first line is what we expected, but the second line is odd. The value of the variable minute is 59, and 59 divided by 60 is 0.98333, not 0. The reason for the discrepancy is that C++ is performing integer division.

When both of the operands are integers (operands are the things operators operate on), the result must also be an integer, and by definition integer division always rounds down, even in cases like this where the next integer is so close.

A possible alternative in this case is to calculate a percentage rather than a fraction:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Percentage of the hour that has passed: &quot;; 
std::cout &lt;&lt; minute*100/60 &lt;&lt; std::endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

The result is:

&lt;tt&gt;Percentage of the hour that has passed: 98&lt;/tt&gt; 

Again the result is rounded down, but at least now the answer is approximately correct. In order to get an even more accurate answer, we could use a different type of variable, called floating-point, that is capable of storing fractional values.

This next example:
{{:C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Operators/Examples/Quotient and Remainder}}
will return:
 Quotient = 6
 Remainder = 3

The ''multiplicative'' operators &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; are always evaluated before the ''additive'' operators &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;. Among operators of the same class, evaluation proceeds from left to right. This order can be overridden using grouping by parentheses, &lt;tt&gt;(&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt;; the expression contained within parentheses is evaluated before any other neighboring operator is evaluated. But note that some [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler|compilers]] may not strictly follow these rules when they try to optimize the code being generated, unless violating the rules would give a different answer.

For example the following statements convert a temperature expressed in degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit and vice versa:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
deg_f = deg_c * 9 / 5 + 32;
deg_c = ( deg_f - 32 ) * 5 / 9;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Compound assignment ===
One of the most common patterns in software with regards to operators is to update a value:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
a = a + 1;
b = b * 2;
c = c / 4;
&lt;/source&gt;

Since this pattern is used many times, there is a shorthand for it called compound assignment operators.  They are a combination of an existing arithmetic operator and assignment operator:

* +=
* -=
* *= 
* /= 
* %=
* &lt;&lt;= 
* &gt;&gt;= 
* |= 
* &amp;=
* ^= 

Thus the example given in the beginning of the section could be rewritten as

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
a += 1;  // Equivalent to (a = a + 1)
b *= 2;  // Equivalent to (b = b * 2)
c /= 4;  // Equivalent to (c = c / 4)
&lt;/source&gt;

{{TODO|Parent topic may need a re-writing. About optimization and distinction on the steps in a &lt;nowiki&gt;+= 1, a = a + 1, ++a or a++&lt;/nowiki&gt;.}}

=== Character operators ===
Interestingly, the same mathematical operations that work on integers also work on characters. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
char letter; 
letter = 'a' + 1; 
std::cout &lt;&lt; letter &lt;&lt; std::endl; 
&lt;/source&gt;

For the above example, outputs the letter b (on most systems -- note that C++ doesn't assume use of ASCII, EBCDIC, Unicode etc. but rather allows for all of these and other [[w:charset|charsets]]). Although it is syntactically legal to multiply characters, it is almost never useful to do it.

Earlier I said that you can only assign integer values to integer variables and character values to character variables, but that is not completely true. In some cases, C++ converts automatically between types. For example, the following is legal.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int number; 
number = 'a'; 
std::cout &lt;&lt; number &lt;&lt; std::endl; 
&lt;/source&gt;

On most mainstream desktop computers the result is 97, which is the number that is used internally by C++ on that system to represent the letter 'a'. However, it is generally a good idea to treat characters as characters, and integers as integers, and only convert from one to the other if there is a good reason.  Unlike some other languages, C++ does not make strong assumptions about how the underlying platform represents characters; ASCII, EBCDIC and others are possible, and portable code will not make assumptions (except that '0', '1', ..., '9' are sequential, so that e.g. '9'-'0' == 9).

Automatic type conversion is an example of a common problem in designing a programming language, which is that there is a conflict between formalism, which is the requirement that formal languages should have simple rules with few exceptions, and convenience, which is the requirement that programming languages be easy to use in practice.

More often than not, convenience wins, which is usually good for expert programmers, who are spared from rigorous but unwieldy formalism, but bad for beginning programmers, who are often baffled by the complexity of the rules and the number of exceptions. In this book I have tried to simplify things by emphasizing the rules and omitting many of the exceptions.

=== Bitwise operators ===
These operators deal with a bitwise operations. Bit operations needs the understanding of binary numeration since it will deal with on one or two bit patterns or binary numerals at the level of their individual bits. On most microprocessors, bitwise operations are sometimes slightly faster than addition and subtraction operations and usually significantly faster than multiplication and division operations.

Bitwise operations especially important for much low-level programming from optimizations to writing device drivers, low-level graphics, communications protocol packet assembly and decoding.

Although machines often have efficient built-in instructions for performing arithmetic and logical operations, in fact all these operations can be performed just by combining the bitwise operators and zero-testing in various ways.

The bitwise operators work bit by bit on the operands. The operands must be of integral type (one of the types used for integers). 

For this section, recall that a number starting with '''0x''' is hexadecimal (hexa, or hex for short or referred also as base-16). Unlike the normal decimal system using powers of 10 and the digits 0123456789, hex uses powers of 16 and the symbols 0123456789abcdef. In the examples remember that Oxc equals 1100 in binary and 12 in decimal. C++ does not directly support binary notation, which would hamper readability of the code.

;NOT
; ~a    :  bitwise complement of '''a'''.
: ~0xc produces the value -1-0xc (in binary, ~1100 produces ...11110011 where &quot;...&quot; may be many more 1 bits)

The negation operator is a unary operator which precedes the operand, This operator must not be confused with the &quot;logical not&quot; operator, &quot;&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (exclamation point), which treats the entire value as a single [[w:Boolean datatype|Boolean]]—changing a true value to false, and vice versa. The &quot;logical not&quot; is not a bitwise operation.

These others are binary operators which lie between the two operands. The precedence of these operators is lower than that of the relational and equivalence operators; it is often required to parenthesize expressions involving bitwise operators.

;AND
; a &amp; b :  bitwise boolean and of '''a''' and '''b'''
: 0xc &amp; 0xa produces the value 0x8 (in binary, 1100 &amp; 1010 produces 1000)

The [[w:truth table|truth table]] of '''a AND b''':
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
|+

|-
| 1  || 0  || 0

|-
| 0  || 0  || 0
|}

;OR
; a | b :  bitwise boolean or of '''a''' and '''b'''
: 0xc | 0xa produces the value 0xe (in binary, 1100 | 1010 produces 1110)

The [[w:truth table|truth table]] of '''a OR b''' is:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
|+
! style=&quot;width:35px;background:#aaaaaa;&quot; | a

| 1  || 1  || 1
|-
| 1  || 0  || 1
|-
| 0  || 1  || 1
|-
| 0  || 0  || 0
|}


;XOR
; a ^ b :  bitwise xor of '''a''' and '''b'''
: 0xc ^ 0xa produces the value 0x6 (in binary, 1100 ^ 1010 produces 0110)

The [[w:truth table|truth table]] of '''a XOR b''':
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;

| 1  || 1  || 0
|-
| 1  || 0  || 1
|-
| 0  || 1  || 1
|-
| 0  || 0  || 0
|}

;Bit shifts
; a &lt;&lt; b :  shift '''a''' left by '''b''' (multiply a by &lt;math&gt;2^b&lt;/math&gt;)
: 0xc &lt;&lt; 1 produces the value 0x18 (in binary, 1100 &lt;&lt; 1 produces the value 11000)

; a &gt;&gt; b :  shift '''a''' right by '''b''' (divide a by &lt;math&gt;2^b&lt;/math&gt;)
: 0xc &gt;&gt; 1 produces the value 0x6 (in binary, 1100 &gt;&gt; 1 produces the value 110)

=== Derived types operators ===
There are three data types known as pointers, references, and arrays, that have their own operators for dealing with them. Those are &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;-&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;.*&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;-&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;. 

Pointers, references, and arrays are fundamental data types that deal with accessing other variables. Pointers are used to pass around a variables ''address'' (where it is in memory), which can be used to have multiple ways to access a single variable. References are aliases to other objects, and are similar in use to pointers, but still very different. Arrays are large blocks of contiguous memory that can be used to store multiple objects of the same type, like a sequence of characters to make a string.

==== Subscript operator [ ] ====
This operator is used to access an object of an array. It is also used when declaring array types, allocating them, or deallocating them.
{{:C++ Programming/Operators/Arrays}}

==== address-of operator &amp; ====
To get the address of a variable so that you can assign a pointer, you use the &quot;address of&quot; operator, which is denoted by the ampersand &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; symbol. The &quot;address of&quot; operator does exactly what it says, it returns the &quot;address of&quot; a variable, a symbolic constant, or a element in an array, in the form of a pointer of the corresponding type. To use the &quot;address of&quot; operator, you tack it on in front of the variable that you wish to have the address of returned. It is also used when declaring reference types.

Now, do not confuse the &quot;address of&quot; operator with the declaration of a reference. Because use of operators is restricted to expression, the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler|compiler]] knows that &lt;tt&gt;&amp;sometype&lt;/tt&gt; is the &quot;address of&quot; operator being used to denote the return of the address of &lt;tt&gt;sometype&lt;/tt&gt; as a [[C++ Programming/Operators/Pointers|pointer]].

===== References =====
References are a way of assigning a &quot;handle&quot; to a variable.  References can also be thought of as &quot;aliases&quot;; they're not real objects, they're just alternative names for other objects.

;''Assigning References'': This is the less often used variety of references, but still worth noting as an introduction to the use of references in function arguments. Here we create a reference that looks and acts like a standard variable except that it operates on the same data as the variable that it references.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int tZoo = 3;       // tZoo == 3
int &amp;refZoo = tZoo; // tZoo == 3
refZoo = 5;         // tZoo == 5
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;refZoo&lt;/tt&gt; is a reference to &lt;tt&gt;tZoo&lt;/tt&gt;. Changing the value of &lt;tt&gt;refZoo&lt;/tt&gt; also changes the value of &lt;tt&gt;tZoo&lt;/tt&gt;.

{{NOTE|One use of variable references is to pass function arguments using references. This allows the function to update / change the data in the variable being referenced }}

For example say we want to have a function to swap 2 integers

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void swap(int &amp;a, int &amp;b){
  int temp = a; 
  a = b; 
  b = temp;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int main(){
   int x = 5; 
   int y = 6; 
   int &amp;refx = x; 
   int &amp;refy = y; 
   swap(refx, refy); // now x = 6 and y = 5
   swap(x, y); // and now x = 5 and y = 6 again
}
&lt;/source&gt;

References cannot be null as they refer to instantiated objects, while pointers can be null. References cannot be reassigned, while pointers can be. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int main(){
   int x = 5;
   int y = 6;
   int &amp;refx = x;
   &amp;refx = y; // won't compile
}
&lt;/source&gt;

As references provide strong guarantees when compared with pointers, using references makes the code simpler. Therefore using references should usually be preferred over using pointers. Of course, pointers have to be used at the time of dynamic memory allocation (new) and deallocation (delete).

=== Dynamic memory allocation ===
'''Dynamic memory allocation''' is the allocation of [[w:computer storage|memory]] storage for use in a [[w:computer program|computer program]] during the [[w:runtime|runtime]] of that program.  It is a way of distributing ownership of limited memory resources among many pieces of data and code.  Importantly, the amount of memory allocated is determined by the program at the time of allocation and need not be known in advance.  A dynamic allocation exists until it is explicitly released, either by the programmer or by a [[w:garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] implementation; this is notably different from [[w:automatic memory allocation|automatic]] and [[w:static memory allocation|static memory allocation]], which require advance knowledge of the required amount of memory and have a fixed duration.  It is said that an object so allocated has ''dynamic lifetime''.

The task of fulfilling an allocation request, which involves finding a block of unused memory of sufficient size, is complicated by the need to avoid both internal and external [[w:fragmentation (computer)|fragmentation]] while keeping both allocation and deallocation [[w:Algorithmic_efficiency|efficient]]. Also, the allocator's [[w:metadata (computing)|metadata]] can inflate the size of (individually) small allocations; [[w:chunking (computing)|chunking]] attempts to reduce this effect.

Usually, memory is allocated from a large pool of unused memory area called '''the heap''' (also called the '''free store''').  Since the precise location of the allocation is not known in advance, the memory is accessed indirectly, usually via a [[w:reference (computer science)|reference]]. The precise algorithm used to organize the memory area and allocate and deallocate chunks is hidden behind an abstract interface and may use any of the methods described below.

You have probably wondered how programmers allocate memory efficiently without knowing, prior to running the program, how much memory will be necessary. Here is when the fun starts with dynamic memory allocation.

===== new and delete =====
For dynamic memory allocation we use the '''new''' and '''delete''' keywords, the old malloc from C functions can now be avoided but are still accessible for compatibility and low level control reasons.

{{TODO|add info on malloc|C++ Programming}}

As covered before, we assign values to pointers using the &quot;address of&quot; operator because it returns the address in memory of the variable or constant in the form of a pointer. Now, the &quot;address of&quot; operator is NOT the only operator that you can use to assign a pointer. You have yet another operator that returns a pointer, which is the new operator. The new operator allows the programmer to allocate memory for a specific data type, struct, class, etc., and gives the programmer the address of that allocated sect of memory in the form of a pointer. The new operator is used as an rvalue, similar to the &quot;address of&quot; operator. Take a look at the code below to see how the new operator works.

By assigning the pointers to an allocated sector of memory, rather than having to use a variable declaration, you basically override the &quot;middleman&quot; (the variable declaration). Now, you can allocate memory dynamically without having to know the number of variables you should declare.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int n = 10; 
SOMETYPE *parray, *pS; 
int *pint; 

parray = new SOMETYPE[n]; 
pS = new SOMETYPE; 
pint = new int; 
&lt;/source&gt;

If you looked at the above piece of code, you can use the new operator to allocate memory for arrays too, which comes quite in handy when we need to manipulate the sizes of large arrays and or classes efficiently. The memory that your pointer points to because of the new operator can also be &quot;deallocated,&quot; not destroyed but rather, freed up from your pointer. The delete operator is used in front of a pointer and frees up the address in memory to which the pointer is pointing.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
delete [] parray;// note the use of [] when destroying an array allocated with new
delete pint; 
&lt;/source&gt;

The memory pointed to by &lt;code&gt;parray&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;pint&lt;/code&gt; have been freed up, which is a very good thing because when you're manipulating multiple large arrays, you try to avoid losing the memory someplace by leaking it. Any allocation of memory needs to be properly deallocated or a leak will occur and your program won't run efficiently. Essentially, every time you use the new operator on something, you should use the delete operator to free that memory before exiting. The delete operator, however, not only can be used to delete a pointer allocated with the new operator, but can also be used to &quot;delete&quot; a null pointer, which prevents attempts to delete non-allocated memory (this action compiles and does nothing).

You must keep in mind that &lt;tt&gt;new T&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;new T()&lt;/tt&gt; are not equivalent. This will be more understandable after you are introduced to more complex types like classes, but keep in mind that when using &lt;code&gt;new T()&lt;/code&gt; it will initialize the &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; memory location (&quot;zero out&quot;) before calling the constructor (if you have non-initialized members variables, they will be initialized by default).

The '''new''' and '''delete''' operators do not have to be used in conjunction with each other within the same function or block of code. It is proper and often advised to write functions that allocate memory and other functions that deallocate memory.  Indeed, the currently favored style is to release resources in object's destructors, using the so-called [[w:RAII|resource acquisition is initialization]] (RAII) idiom.

{{TODO|Move or split some of the information or add references, classes, destructor and constructors have yet to be introduced and below we are using a vector for the example|C++ Programming}}

As we will see when we get to the Classes, a '''class''' destructor is the ideal location for its deallocator, it is often advisable to leave memory allocators out of classes' constructors. Specifically, using '''new''' to create an array of objects, each of which also uses '''new''' to allocate memory during its construction, often results in runtime errors. If a '''class''' or structure contains members which must be pointed at dynamically-created objects, it is best to sequentially initialize arrays of the parent object, rather than leaving the task to their constructors.

{{NOTE|If possible you should use &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;delete&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;malloc&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;free&lt;/tt&gt;.}}

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// Example of a dynamic array

const int b = 5;
int *a = new int[b];

//to delete
delete[] a;
&lt;/source&gt;

The ideal way is to not use arrays at all, but rather the STL's vector type (a container similar to an array).  To achieve the above functionality, you should do:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const int b = 5;
std::vector&lt;int&gt; a;
a.resize(b);

//to delete
a.clear();
&lt;/source&gt;

Vectors allow for easy insertions even when &quot;full.&quot;  If, for example, you filled up &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, you could easily make room for a 6th element like so:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int new_number = 99;
a.push_back( new_number );//expands the vector to fit the 6th element
&lt;/source&gt;

You can similarly dynamically allocate a rectangular multidimensional array (be careful about the type syntax for the pointers):

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const int d = 5;
int (*two_d_array)[4] = new int[d][4];

//to delete
delete[] two_d_array;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also emulate a ragged multidimensional array (sub-arrays not the same size) by allocating an array of pointers, and then allocating an array for each of the pointers. This involves a loop. 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
const int d1 = 5, d2 = 4;
int **two_d_array = new int*[d1];
for( int i = 0; i &lt; d1; ++i)
  two_d_array[i] = new int[d2];

//to delete
for( int i = 0; i &lt; d1; ++i)
  delete[] two_d_array[i];

delete[] two_d_array;
&lt;/source&gt;

We could also have lessons, but that is probably in the future.  Another thing we could have is a study plan for students so that they can pace themselves in their studying and not end up cramming the night before like I did.

I have completed English --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 14:26, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

I started a bibliography.  Please add all of your sources for your information there.  Thanks. --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 14:49, 4 September 2005 (UTC)

Hey, I think its great that you started an ACT wikibook. I'm in a prep class for ACT and remembered seeing this a while ago. Its really a shame that you haven't had more help. Anyway, I have a big ass (800+ pg.) ACT book and I'm signing up. I'll help out with whatever I can, put I really would like to have all the blanks filled in by the time I take the ACT. - [[User:Ridge Racer|Ridge Racer]] 13:24, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

I can help write the math section, although I don't think I'll be able to finish it on my own...--[[User:Generic Name|Generic Name]] 03:43, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
If you have any suggestions for format, new pages, new sections, etc. please list them here.


Could you add a short introduction that describes what ACT is, for the benefit of those of us whoa re not from North America? Better still if you could add it to the title so that it would show up from the referring page. Thanks
*I didn't quite understand the second part of your question, but I added the information to the [[ACT/Overview| Overview]] page.  If you have any more comments, please add them.  I hadn't thought about people who might not know what the ACT is.  Thanks for your suggestion. --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 22:42, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

I saw the overview, but it refers to terms such as &quot;juniors&quot; and &quot;seniors&quot; in &quot;high school&quot;. Terminology about schools differs throughout the world, so I have no idea what they mean. Could you say what age students who take these exams tend to be. Are they 17 and 18 year olds, or something different? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:09, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== Writing section ==

&lt;nowiki&gt;I did not see &quot;writing&quot; among the sections of the test, is there a piece devoted to that part of the test? &lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kinematics is the study of the way objects move. It focuses on describing an object's motion, and doesn't explain how forces affect it.

==Distance and displacement==

[[Image:Distancedisplacement.png|250px|right|thumb|Although the distance covered is 25m, the displacement is 10m in the direction shown by the green arrow.]]

You may already be familiar with the term '''distance''', as the distance between two points is the length of the path a body takes between those two points.

Distance is a scalar, so if you were to walk 10m North, and then 10m South, you would have covered a distance of 20m.

'''Displacement''', however, is a vector quantity.  Displacement, in a sense, is simply the shortest distance between any two points. If a body ends up at the same spot as its initial position after travelling through some distance, we say that the ''displacement'' of the body is 0, so the above example would give you a total displacement of 0m.

In the diagram on the right, if the distance covered was 25m, then the displacement would be 10m. You can find the displacement by measuring the length of the line between the start and end points.

A measurement is a displacement if it has a specified direction, otherwise it is a distance.

The symbol for distance is ''d'', and the symbol for displacement is ''s'' or ''x''. Be careful not to confuse the ''s'' for displacement with s for seconds.

==Speed and velocity==

The '''speed''' of an object is the distance it moves in a unit of time.

You can find the speed of an object if you know the distance an object moved, and the time it took to move that distance:

&lt;math&gt;average\ speed = \frac {distance\ moved}{time\ taken}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;s=\frac {d}{t}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Velocity''' is a vector, and similar to the difference between distance and displacement, velocity is speed in a specified direction.

A vehicle could be moving with constant speed, but have a changing velocity. This happens when the vehicle turns. Imagine a racing car is moving along the track with a speed of 20m s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. If this direction is taken to be positive, then the car's velocity is also 20m s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Now, if the car was to turn into a &quot;U&quot; bend, its velocity would change. When the car is perpendicular to the first straight, the car will still have a speed of 20m/s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, but its velocity will now be 0m/s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. When the car has made the turn and is coming back to the starting point, the speed is still 20m/s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, but the velocity is -20m/s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, since the car is now moving in the opposite direction.

The symbol for speed is ''s'', and the symbol for velocity is ''v''. Be careful not to confuse the ''s'' for speed with ''s'' for displacement or s for seconds.

==Acceleration==

'''Acceleration''' is the rate of change of velocity. In other words, acceleration is the amount an object's velocity changes in a unit of time.

If you know the change in velocity and the time the change took, you can find acceleration using the formula:

&lt;math&gt;acceleration = \frac {change\ in\ velocity}{time\ taken\ for\ change}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;a=\frac {\Delta v}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively, if you have the initial and final velocities, you can use the formula:

&lt;math&gt;a=\frac {v-u}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the initial velocity, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the final velocity.

&lt;math&gt;\Delta &lt;/math&gt; (Delta) means &quot;change in&quot;.

Acceleration is a vector, and can slow down objects as well as speed them up. An object will slow down when its acceleration is opposite to its velocity. The object is now '''decelerating'''.

Something can be said to be accelerating if it's changing direction. In the example above, the car changes its velocity by turning a corner. Since acceleration is the rate of ''change'' of velocity, the car is accelerating.

Acceleration is measured in metres per second per second, or &lt;math&gt;m/s^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. If something had an acceleration of &lt;math&gt;10m/s^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, it means that its speed increases by &lt;math&gt;10m/s&lt;/math&gt; each second.

==Measuring speed and acceleration==

===Light gates===
The Light Gate has an infrared transmitter and receiver, mounted in a robust steel housing avoids any misalignment problems. The Light Gate can be used for studying free fall, air track and incline plane experiments.

===Ticker tape timer===
The ticker tape timer is used in the measurement of velocity acceleration and general timing. It has a frequency of 50 to 60Hz (varies according to type) equivalent to that of the mains power supply. It will give good results if operated from a 12V a.c. power supply. The timer uses an electromagnet which activates a striker producing dots via a carbon disk on the ticker tape. At 50Hz, each dot will represent 0.02seconds.While at 60Hz, one dot represents 0.01seconds.

===Accelerometer===
This device is used for the measurement of acceleration and the unit is in metre per second square (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

==The equations of motion==

From the definitions of position, velocity and acceleration, one can derive the relationships between the three vectors.

* &lt;math&gt; \vec{v_f} = \vec{v_i} + \vec{a} \Delta t \ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \Delta \vec{s} = \vec{v_i} \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} \vec{a}(\Delta t)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; {\vec{v_f}}^2 = {\vec{v_i}}^2 + 2\vec{a} \Delta s \ &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration in the direction of the velocity, &lt;math&gt;\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt; is displacement, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time, &lt;math&gt;\vec{v_i}&lt;/math&gt; is initial velocity and &lt;math&gt;\vec{v_f}&lt;/math&gt; is final velocity. Note that these equations only work when an object has &lt;b&gt;constant acceleration&lt;/b&gt; and the direction of motion is &lt;b&gt;linear&lt;/b&gt;.

===Using the equations===

===Deriving the equations===

As stated above, the equations of motion are derived from:

&lt;math&gt; \vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{s}}{\Delta t} , \vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;. 

====Deriving &lt;math&gt;\Delta s = v_{avg}\times \Delta t &lt;/math&gt; ====

The expression &lt;math&gt;\frac{v_i + v_f}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is the average velocity during the time frame. This is allowed only in a linear context; non linear kinematics requires the use of calculus. Because the average velocity accounts for the variations of the velocities during a linear change, the total distance traveled is thus the velocity during the time frame multiplied by the time.

====Deriving s = ut + 1/2 a(Δt)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;====&lt;!--done without math tags so it shows in the contents--&gt;

This equation is derived from the equations &lt;math&gt; v = u + a \Delta t \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta s = \frac{(u+v)}{2} \cdot \Delta t &lt;/math&gt;.

Substitute &lt;math&gt; v = u + a \Delta t \ &lt;/math&gt; into the equation &lt;math&gt; \Delta s = \frac{(u+v)}{2} \cdot \Delta t &lt;/math&gt;

:{|
|&lt;math&gt; \Delta s \ &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \frac{u+u+a \Delta t}{2} \cdot \Delta t &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \frac{2u \Delta t}{2} + \frac{a(\Delta t)^2}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; u \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} a (\Delta t)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}

An alternative derivation that is more commonly used is done by Calculus. 
Assuming &lt;math&gt;v=u+at&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt; \frac{ds}{dt} =v &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt; s = \int{vdt} &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt; s = \int{(u+at) dt} &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt; s = ut + \frac{at^2}{2} + C &lt;/math&gt;

*the boundary condition is that at t = 0, \Delta s = 0  so C = 0. Thus the equation becomes 

*&lt;math&gt;s = ut + \frac{at^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

====Deriving v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = u&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2aΔs====

This equation is derived from the equations &lt;math&gt; \Delta s = u \Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(\Delta t)^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a=\frac {v-u}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;.

Multiply &lt;math&gt; \Delta s = u \Delta t + \frac{1}{2}a(\Delta t)^2 &lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt; a = \frac{v-u}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a \Delta s = \frac{1}{2}(v+u) \cdot \Delta t \cdot \frac{(v-u)}{\Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 2a \Delta s = (v+u)(v-u) \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 2a \Delta s = v^2 - u^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v^2 = u^2 + 2a \Delta s \ &lt;/math&gt;

===Deriving the equations in vectors===
* All constant are taken in capital letters
* All variable are given in small letter
====Deriving v(t) = U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + A (t - T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)==== 
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{a} = \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2 \ \vec{s}}{dt^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
so &lt;br\&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) = \int _{T_i} ^t \vec a dt &lt;/math&gt;

for zero or constant acceleration A we have 
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) = \vec A  \int _{T_i} ^t  dt &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) = \vec A \,  [t] _{T_i} ^t &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) = \vec A \,  (t - {T_i}) + K &lt;/math&gt;
we have one unknown K , we need to consider initial or final condition
* Lets take initially we have &lt;math&gt; \vec v (T_i) = \vec U_i&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec U_i = \vec A \,  ({T_i} - {T_i}) + K &lt;/math&gt;
i.e.
: &lt;math&gt; k= \vec U_i &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) = \vec U_i + \vec A \,  (t - {T_i})  &lt;/math&gt;
If we take final condition in consideration then i.e.: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (T_f) = \vec V_f&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) = \vec V_f + \vec A \,  ({T_f} -t )  &lt;/math&gt;
constant acceleration can be found using initial and final condition

: &lt;math&gt; \vec A =  \frac { \vec V_f - \vec U_i }{ T_f - T_i} &lt;/math&gt;

====Deriving s(t) = S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(t-T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) + (1/2)A (t - T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;====

now we have 

: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) = \frac{d \vec{s}}{dt} = \vec U_i + \vec A \,  (t - {T_i})  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(t)= \int _{T_i} ^{t} \Big(\vec U_i + \vec A \,  (t - {T_i}) \Big) {dt} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(t) = (\vec U_i - \vec A \, T_i ) \int _{T_i} ^{t} {dt} + \vec A \int _{T_i} ^{t} t \ {dt} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(t) = (\vec U_i - \vec A \, T_i ) \ \Big[t\Big]  ^{t} _{T_i} + \vec A \Bigg[\frac { t^2} {2} \Bigg] _{T_i} ^{t} + K &lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(t) = (\vec U_i - \vec A \, T_i ) ( {t} - {T_i} ) + \frac {\vec A } {2 } (t^2-{T_i}^2) + K &lt;/math&gt;

for eliminating K we need either final or initial condition i.e. &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(T_i) = \vec S_i  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \vec{S_i} = (\vec U_i - \vec A \, T_i ) ( {T_i} - {T_i} ) + \frac {\vec A } {2 } ({T_i}^2-{T_i}^2) + K &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; K= \vec{S_i} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(t) = \vec{S_i}  + (\vec U_i - \vec A \, T_i ) ( {t} - {T_i} ) + \frac {\vec A } {2 } (t^2-{T_i}^2)
 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(t) = \vec{S_i}  + \vec U_i ( {t} - {T_i} ) - \vec A  ( {t}T_i - {T_i}^2 ) + \frac {\vec A } {2 } (t^2-{T_i}^2)
 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(t) = \vec{S_i}  + \vec U_i ( {t} - {T_i} ) + \frac {\vec A } {2 } (t^2 - 2 {t}T_i +  {T_i}^2)
 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(t) = \vec{S_i}  + \vec U_i ( {t} - {T_i} ) + \frac {\vec A } {2 } (t - T_i ) ^2
 &lt;/math&gt;

If we would have taken final condition i.e. &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(T_f) = \vec S_f  &lt;/math&gt;
then

: &lt;math&gt; \vec{s}(t) = \vec{S_f}  + \vec V_f ( {T_f} - {t} ) - \frac {\vec A } {2 } (T_f - t ) ^2
 &lt;/math&gt;

====Deriving |v(t)|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = |U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 A . (s(t)-S_i)====
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) = \vec U_i + \vec A \,  (t - {T_i})  &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) \cdot \vec v (t) = \big(\vec U_i + \vec A \,  (t - {T_i}) \big)\cdot\big(\vec U_i + \vec A \,  (t - {T_i}) \big) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) \cdot \vec v (t) =   \vec U_i \cdot \vec U_i + \vec A \cdot \vec A \ (t - T_i)^2 + 2 \vec A \cdot \vec U_i (t- T_i)  &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) \cdot \vec v (t) =   \vec U_i \cdot \vec U_i + \vec A \cdot \vec A \ (t - T_i)^2 + 2 \vec A \cdot \Bigg( \vec s(t) - \vec S_i - \frac {\vec A } {2 } (t - T_i ) ^2 \Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) \cdot \vec v (t) =   \vec U_i \cdot \vec U_i + \vec A \cdot \vec A \ (t - T_i)^2 + 2 \vec A \cdot ( \vec s(t) - \vec S_i) - 2 \vec A \cdot ( \frac {\vec A } {2 } (t - T_i ) ^2 )&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt; \vec v (t) \cdot \vec v (t) =   \vec U_i \cdot \vec U_i + 2 \vec A \cdot ( \vec s(t) - \vec S_i)  &lt;/math&gt;

taking case for final velocity 

: &lt;math&gt; \vec V_f \cdot \vec V_f =   \vec U_i \cdot \vec U_i + 2 \vec A \cdot ( \vec S_f - \vec S_i)  &lt;/math&gt;
or

: &lt;math&gt; \left | \vec V_f \right | ^ 2 =   \left | \vec U_i \right | ^ 2 + 2 \vec A \cdot ( \vec S_f - \vec S_i)  &lt;/math&gt;

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Stlemur. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Stlemur~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''Cherry brownies''' are a rich brownie with no frosting and a fudge-like base and a cheesecake-like top, filled with maraschino cherries and chocolate chips.

== Ingredients ==

=== Base ===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (2.4 dl) granulated [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
* 6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbsp]] [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* &amp;frac14; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (0.6 dl) baking [[Cookbook:Cocoa|cocoa]]
* &amp;frac34; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (1.8 dl) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* &amp;frac14; [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

=== Top ===
* 4 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (110 g) softened [[cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
* &amp;frac14; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (0.6 dl) maraschino cherry syrup
* &amp;frac14; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (0.6 dl) [[cookbook:icing sugar|icing sugar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
* &amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (1.2 dl) semi-sweet [[cookbook:Chocolate chip|chocolate chips]]
* &amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (1.2 dl) [[cookbook:Cherry|maraschino cherries]]

== Procedure ==
# Melt margarine in a [[cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]] at medium-low heat, then mix in the cocoa.
# Add the sugar, salt and first two eggs, blend well and then [[cookbook:fold|fold]] in the flour.
# Spread in a greased 9&quot; by 9&quot; (22 cm by 22 cm) cake pan and set aside.
# [[cookbook:Beat|Beat]] the cream cheese, cherry syrup and icing sugar together in a bowl until creamy.
# Add the remaining egg to the mixture and blend well.
# Add the chocolate chips and cherries.
# Pour the second mixture over top the base.
# Bake at 350 &amp;deg;F/175 &amp;deg;C for 30 to 40 minutes, until a toothpick poked through the centre comes out moist (but not wet with batter).
#  Let cool and cut into 36 squares.

== Notes, tips and variations ==

* Cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting and eating or you will have hot broken brownies.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Southern_cuisine |Southern U.S. Cuisine]]

== Ingredients ==


* 1-pound [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potatoes]]
* 3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] juice
* 1/2 cup firmly packed [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
* 1/4-tablespoon wheat germ
* 1-tablespoon [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 2 tablespoons grated orange peel
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* 1/4 teaspoon fresh grated [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]

== Procedure ==

# Slice sweet potatoes about 1/8 inch thick and spread evenly in an 8-inch square dish.
# Combine orange juice, brown sugar, wheat germ, margarine, orange peel, cinnamon and nutmeg in bowl.
# Pour liquid mixture over the sweet potatoes.
# Cover dish with foil or lid.  Bake 1 hour, until potatoes are tender.

== Notes, tips and variations ==

* This did not come with a heat at which to bake, however, based on other candied sweet potato recipes; 350°F should likely prove the right temperature for the job.

Acceptable. How mysteriously they flourished and how mysteriously they end; how their calculations were as accurate as modern ones; how Adolf Hitler stole Mayan stuff from other countries and they got bombed; and why only three are left today. Not mentioned.
=== Accuracy ===
I know little about it, so I don't want to comment, although I doubt that the descendants are still living. I thought who's living are the descendants of the Mayan's ''slaves''.
=== Grammar and tone ===
Only acceptable. Parts of it, if not most of it, are too difficult for younger readers of eight or nine. (Topology, for example.) The tone is not very consistent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I shifted some things around so that it makes more sense (the shift from Greek to Roman dominance is no longer at the end of the article) I also cleaned up some things, and gave a few lines a more neutral tone.

Where is the information on the Silk Road (or, preferably, &quot;silk Routes&quot;) promised in the title of this page? Is the page, perhaps,not yet complete?

Thanks,

Oops, I deleted this page by mistake, but it's now restored. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:13, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== Restructure needed ==

I belive this chapter lacks the length and structure necessary to truly guide the reader through the classical to the Medieval period.  It refers little to Roman territorial expansion, has nothing on the Triumvirate and the fall of the Republic, and has no graphics or maps of any kind.  I will attempt to update it as best as I can with my limited knowledge of HTML.


Added Initial territorial Expansion.  I will be contributing fairly regularly as I have time.  I was planning on going to Graccus and the Triumvirate next if anyone would like to work on it.

Nereid is a moon of the planet Neptune. It is sometimes called &quot;Neptune II&quot;. We still do not know much about this moon. Because it has an unusual orbit, scientists think that it may have been an asteroid that was captured by Neptune's gravity.

==How big is Nereid?==
This is the third largest of the moons of Neptune, but it is only 340 km across

==How long is a day on Nereid?==
A day on Nereid is 11 and a half hours.

==How much would Nereid's gravity pull on me?==
Nereid is only a small moon that has very low gravity. 

'''Newtons''' describe how hard gravity is pulling you down.  On Earth, if you weigh 51 kilograms or 112 pounds, your weight is 500 newtons. We only use newtons for some special purposes, when we are really interested in how hard we push down on something because gravity is pulling us.

Your weight in newtons would be much less on Nereid, only about 1/137 what it is on Earth.  A typical adult would weigh about half a newton. But then you'll have to add in the weight of your spacesuit as well, because that is pressing down on the surface just like you are.

==Who is it named after?==
This moon was named for the sea-nymphs from Greek mythology. A nymph is a nature spirit that looks like a beautiful woman.

==How was it discovered?==
It was discovered in 1949 by the astronomer Gerard P. Kuiper.

== content format==

So how is the content of the articles going to be created? is going to be like a copy/paste job with some editing to make the content easier to understand or are we writing completly fresh articles? --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 19:48, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I really think we should start afresh. It will be much easier IMO to write for children from the start, than it would be to copy and paste from Wikipedia and them simplify the text. Children texts shouldn't (IMO) be  just simpler versions of adult texts minus the long words. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:07, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:We should, however, take advantage of the tables and images, perhaps modifying and simplifying them for kids. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 20:09, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Glossary == 

How would you all feel about a glossary at the end of the book. For instance, '''speed of light''', ''satellite''', etc. [[User:Danny|Danny]] 20:09, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:In my opinion, a glossary is essential for a children's non-fiction work. [[User:Angela|Angela]] 20:12, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:That's very sensible. Many educational texts highlight the first instance of &quot;keywords&quot; in a different colour, so that children know that this is a new word that they may not have come across. The colour clues them up to the fact that this word is in the glossary. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:15, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

totally agree with theresa, any bolded text in the booklets should be added to the glossary, so children can then easily reference them. also has a name been chose aside from wikijunior? --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 20:55, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:No not yet. We just using wikijunior as a working title until we do decide on a name. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:12, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Do you want to write your own definitions for the Glossary of link/copy an online dictionary? I linked the 1st three definitions to Wikipedia, but you might also want to write out a simplified defination on the page relating to what the term refers to. --[[User:Desertfox 59|DesertFox_59 {X}]] 20:48, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:I think we should have our own glossary, writen with children in mind. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 08:49, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== additional articles==

i beleive we should include articles on the [[wikipedia:kuiper belt]] and [[wikipedia:oort cloud]] as they are integral parts of our solar system. for example it is now known that pluto is not in fact a planet but a 'mini planet' that was pulled toward neptune by its gravity from the kuiper belt. see discover magazine nov issue. i've been planning to update the wikipedia article with this and other info. --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 21:05, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:I agree. We do have to be careful about very recent information though. It's good to have the latest info, but we must make sure it's solid. New theories sometimes turn out to be wrong. Having said that having new stuff will make our booklets stand out from the crowd. I want our work to not only by cheaper, but also better than the competition. It'll be difficult to get things perfect, but that's no reason not to try. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 17:41, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Format==

before i acually get started is there any particular format that we should be following for the categories? --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 17:02, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Start with a couple of lines as an intro, then use the standard questions as a heading titles. Check out the Nasa website for a wealth of images - go for the largest ones available and thumbnail them down to a better size for the webpage. (the larger images are needed for the print verion) [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 17:43, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

i'm sorry but how exactly would i go about bringing the image over also to format it?--[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 18:17, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I've replied on my talk page. Try getting the image you want first. I'll teach you how to format it later. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:11, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)


== Images ==
Are we allowed to add images from NASA?  What are the copyright issues with images from other internet sites? --[[User:Kdom|StarHawk]] 11:45, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

I defineatly think we need to add as many images as possible to these modules unfortuneatly i can't but i'm sure someone else can. --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 17:16, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I'm adding images from NASA right now. Plus i'm drawing diagrams. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:54, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Content==
Shouldn't there be something about how the planets were discovered?  I could see this being done in two different ways.  One would be to have a brief blurb for each planet or other body telling who discovered it and when, and maybe an interesting detail or two on how it was discovered.  The other approach would be to have a separate article about how our knowledge of the solar system has grown over time, and how we know what we know. I lean slightly to the latter. [[User:Isomorphic|Isomorphic]] 18:49, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:That's a shame because I lean towards the former :-( [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:53, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)
::Mine wasn't a strong leaning.  We should have some historical material included, but how it's organized isn't that important.  I just wanted to make sure there's some mention of people like Galileo, and maybe a bit about the various space probe programs ([[w:Mariner program|Mariner]], [[w:Voyager program|Voyager]], etc.) [[User:Isomorphic|Isomorphic]] 00:06, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)
In the list of questions, there is a question asking about the length of the planets' days. Shouldn't there also be a question about the length of their years? I saw the year lengths given under the header about the day length, so I fixed the numbers. --[[User:StarryTG|StarryTG]] 03:57, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)
*That was a goof of mine. I misread something somewhere. Good catch though. -- [[User:Bobdoe|Bobdoe]] 04:52, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)
**I added a question about the year length. --[[User:StarryTG|StarryTG]] 21:27, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

As to the possible addition of a box with information about the particular God/Goddess the planet was named after, shouldn't there also be a mention of ''why'' that planet was named after that particular deity? i.e. Mars = Red = War. Mercury = Fast orbit = Speed, etc etc. -- [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 01:16, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: Yes, I'd think so. [[User:Lyellin|Lyellin]] 01:19, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: I've added a couple more sentences to the mythology on the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Mercury|Mercury]] page. It's just a start, but I think these secions should start heading in that direction. -- [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 00:53, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::I've added a &quot;mythology box&quot; to the [[Wikijunior Solar System/Mercury|Mercury]] page (a short one that could cetainly be expanded in the future). I think such asides are good additions to the modules, and can be used for any kind of interesting trivia. -- [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 20:49, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::: I like that idea- In general I agree that if we can do an aside like that, we should. [[User:Lyellin|Lyellin]] 20:52, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Dot points ==

Just from browsing through what you guys are doing, it seems a bit all over the place (i know it is still very early days, so dont flame me) just having so many questions/headings with no clear reason from going from one to the next. I think that having too many unrelated questions with short answers somewhat jepodises the flow of the text. Anywho this is the attitude of an 18 yr old not a 7-12 yr old, maybe its perfect for them, i just thought that id mention it. Anywho, looks like you guys are progressing preety fast (or at least faster than us over at south america), so best of luck. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 01:02, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:The answers are short because it's very early days. As time goes on we will give more detailed answers. We can always tidy up later. We need to concentrate on getting information on the page at the moment. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 06:14, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Sizes ==
I worry that the description of sizes is going to go over our targeted age groups head's. We say a lot of big numbers/units which are accurate, but are they going to have a frame of reference to figure out what those really mean? Is there some way to simplify this down so a 7 year old could understand it. (Wishing I was at home and knew where all the Magic school bus books taht we had are). [[User:Lyellin|Lyellin]] 18:31, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: I say leave them in (children won't have trouble realising &quot;this planet is 10 times larger than that one&quot;) but place some references to real things. Sport grounds seem to be popular for this. (Rugby for USA, football (soccer) for UK?) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 20:12, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: As the person who's written what people are copying and pasting for the size content, I must say that comparing planet sizes to real, easily perceivable things is a must for any educational children's book. Sports fields seem ideal for this sort of thing, but are quite localized. American football, for instance, isn't very popular outside America. Should we settle on a standard field or leave it up to the localization crew? -- [[User:Bobdoe|[[User:Bobdoe|Bobdoe]] ([[User talk:Bobdoe|Silence]])]] 07:10, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::American sportsfields are far too small a unit of measurement. We needsomething much bigger. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 10:06, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::: There must be something... how many kids have been to airports? Very few in Africa. Hmmph. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 15:10, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::::I've  been thinking on this. If American football fields are about the same size as real football fields ;-P then although it's too small &quot;football field&quot; would at least be internationally recognised. For larger areas &quot;The size of Africa&quot; might be the way to go as most children would probably recognise that. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 19:14, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::::: We couold try using city blocks, although it may not help for kids that don'y live in cities. --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 19:47, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

we should make units of measurement language specific. ya airports for kids in africa maybe not keep in mind that the children in africa are going to be reading the french, portuguese, or even african language versions. we may be able to leave the units of measurement out or aplicable to change for the translations. --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 19:52, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I'm not entirely sure about that, specifically in the case of African countries, where many countries' national languages are either French or English (ditto, South American countries are Spanish or Portuguese). Are we going to come out with different issues for each country, or is the French version going to come out in all francophone countries? --[[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 17:55, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Try to give some sort of easy context or comparison for ''any'' number.  I just read over [[Wikijunior Solar System/Mercury|Mercury]] and noticed that we were telling kids to multiply 0.378 times their weight.  Now, I don't remember when I learned to multiply with decimel points, but even if a kid can it won't be simple and intuitive.  For now I left the exact number and put an explanation, but I think it would be better to say that you'd weigh a little more than one third what you do on earth and leave it at that.  Remember, this isn't a textbook.  Understanding is more important than precision. [[User:Isomorphic|Isomorphic]] 15:03, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Indeed. Just earlier I had changed similar phrases on that page that said the diameter was 0.385 (or whatever) times the diameter of the Earth. I simplified that to what it is now, but think we should start doing some standardization on this issue. -- [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 17:52, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)


Do we have any policy on whether numbers should always be written using numbers, or whether to include words as well? For instance, on the [[Wikijunior Solar System/The Sun|Sun]] page, I noted that &quot;The sun is 150,000,000 km away.&quot; Do we expect kids to understand so many zeros (and, of course, even more for something like &quot;Pluto is about 6,000,000,000 km away from the sun)?

For the latter example, I'd say it would make sense to say &quot;six billion.&quot; But &quot;one hundrd and fifty million&quot; is a little more of a mouthful (in the first example). Another possibility would be &quot;150 millon.&quot; But how, if at all, should this be standardized? -- [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 17:44, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Article of the Week ==
Should each of the wikibooks have an AOTW, to encourage research on that article. It would in no way preclude efforts on other articles, but I think all three could benefit from a bit of focus (although this one is by the best off). Perhaps to start, Brazil for South America, Lion for Cats, and Earth for Solar? [[User:Lyellin|Lyellin]] 01:08, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I think it's a good idea but it's perhaps a bit too early for that. We are still finding our feet at the moment. When we have some rough text on nearly every page, we could have an article of the week to whip them into good shape? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 06:38, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: *shrugs* I was just thinking an AOTW in order to get proper info on each page. Really depends on philosophy- do you want AOTW to be an edit tool or a contect tool- doesn't bother me either way... just proposing the idea. [[User:Lyellin|Lyellin]] 06:39, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::It could be for either I suppose. Actually scrap my earlier suggestion, it's probably a good idea. Anything that encorages people to contribute can't be a bad thing. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:36, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::::Looks good! [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:34, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Solar System==

With all these pages on the planets, is there no page on the solar system as a whole? How it was formed, when it was formed, diagrams, orbits, etc.? I don't know if this has been discussed elsewhere, but I think that it is certainly needed (along with an overall introduction). -- [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 00:53, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:It's there in the list of other articles. It's just that no one has started it yet. Feel free to go ahead yourself. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 10:02, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::Completely missed it - I was only looking at the list at the top... Thanks, -- [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 10:09, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Wikipedia links==

Do we have a policy on linking to Wikipedia articles? I haven't seen any such links in any articles yet, but would think that this would be a good idea. It would encourage interested readers to pursue information further and more in depth, and provide them with a very good introduction to wikipedia. (Note: If what we're doing here is only for the print version, excuse my confusion. There's to be an online section as well, though, right?) -- [[User:Asbestos|Asbestos]] 00:53, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:There will be a printed booklet and a website (not here) for kids. Since this is intended for young kids I'm not sure linking to a wikipedia article is a good idea. What we could do, as well as bolding words for a glossary is link those words to a section of an online glossary instead. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 10:02, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::I think that we should include &quot;read more in Wikipedia&quot; links too. [[User:Ausir|Ausir]] 18:24, 22 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:::Links within Wikijunior I don't think are a problem (it helps with on-line navigation and the overall experience when seeing it in web-form), but I would have to agree with Teresa knott to suggest it is not a good idea for general links, unless the full URL is displayed (even with Wikipedia), and even then it should be &quot;For More Information&quot; or something like that at the end of the article/module.  The hyperlinks in the glossary are, IMHO, something that needs to go. [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:58, 25 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== How can I help? ==

As I posted on the main Wikijunior Interested Participants page, I would like to help if I can.  I work in the NASA Office of Education.  Thus, I have access to people and a pretty good contact list of people who may want to volunteer here.  I'll try to spend some time reading through this soon to see how we might help.  In the meantime, please let me know if there is anything we may be able to do for the project.  Visit [http://www.nasa.gov/education NASA Education] for some examples of what we do.  --[[User:Jason@NASA|Jason@NASA]] 21:44, 13 May 2005 (UTC)
:That's great!  This project has unfortunately become a bit stagnant.  We could use some new editors, and anyone you'd like to refer would be welcome.  [[User:Isomorphic|Isomorphic]] 02:37, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

I can help, too.  I am great at researching facts.  But I see there are plenty of people here to do that.  Instead, I would like to offer to: 
* Reword sections for a consistant reading comprehension level.  I would probably run one paragraph at a time through the checks in Word, and rewrite to get consistancy.
* Add in-text definitions.  Like body, which, to an 8-year-old, implies the human body.
* Work on consistant usage.  Like planet vs. world.
I will not offer to &quot;punch up&quot; the text, because I think others are better at that.
I am afraid I have already done some work.  So now I will ask permission to continue...

== Expanding sections on larger moons ==

Due to planetary space probes, a considerable amount of information is now available on many of the larger moons of the outer planets.

What I am proposing is that perhaps we could expand this Wikibook to cover at least some of the larger moons of some of the planets, notably the Gallelian moons of Jupiter, Titan, Triton, and perhaps Phobos and Deimos.  The Earth's moon already rates a seperate article, so why not some of these other moons?

From the perspective of a 10 year old reading this, I think it is facinating that there are these whole new worlds that you can learn about.  And there has been quite a bit of insight gained from studying these moons that apply back here to the Earth to understand how our planet works.  The &quot;coolness&quot; factor in talking about the volcanoes of Io might be something neat to discuss as well, or water volcanoes on Triton.  And don't forget the &quot;Death Star&quot; moon:  Mimas.

A similar argument could be made about at least some of the asteroids.  This is a harder line to draw, but there is some significant information and photos of several asteroids that might be worth putting in as a seperate article.  Certainly some distinctions between groups of asteriods, i.e. Trojans, Apollos, Main Belt, etc.

I don't want to overwhelm this wikibook, and I do understand its target audience, but this could be some additional material that would be of interest to younger kids.  I'm throwing this subject up to get some more insight from the community before I rush out and add these articles.

[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:08, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:Articles on some of the major moons could definitely be interesting.  A couple of Neptune's moons are interesting, too.  The asteroids, not so much I think.  [[User:Isomorphic|Isomorphic]] 04:45, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::With over 10K asteroids, most of them would be boring.  There is some hard data about 5-10 asteroids, with pictures even taken by space probes, that would make some rather interesting pages at least as interesting as the larger moons.  Examples are Ceres, Ida, Gaspara, and Pallas.  Ceres and Pallas also have some interesting historic information, as they were used in part to establish the existance of the Asteroid Belt.[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:49, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I've been giving this a little more thought, and I think the best way to add the &quot;moons&quot; would be to make them &quot;optional&quot; sections.  We are trying to keep this wikibook to be about 45-55 pages (on A4 paper, larger font sizes) and adding all of the moons would make this too big.  On the other hand, a more comprehensive books including all of the moons might be useful.  Here is my general guideline/suggestion:

Write each of the sections on the planets themselves as though they can stand &quot;alone&quot; without any information from the separate modules on the moons.  This includes a short 1 paragraph discription about significant moons of the planet.  Hyperlinks can be put in that link to the moon articles (for navigation purposes in the Wiki).

The articles on the moons can still support one another, and will certainly be an area of supplimental details. [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:17, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Who discovered the planet (or moon)? ==

This is somewhat related to the above topic, but I'm proposing another question to be asked for each planet, and that is:  Who discovered the planet?

For most of the planets, it will simply be a part of the mythology and discussions of what people thought about it in ancient times.  The discovery of these bodies is in itself a very fascinating story and something that could be useful to explain to kids.  It also gives credit to some very interesting people who have had a significant role in the development of modern astronomy.

[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:24, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:I think this would be worth putting in.  There's another option though, which was brought up earlier: we could have a separate article on &quot;How we found out about the solar system&quot;.  That could cover the major discoverers as well as some basic info on how astronomy developed: things like who made the earliest telescopes, or what the major NASA probe missions have been. I was definitely interested in that kind of thing when I was a kid.  [[User:Isomorphic|Isomorphic]] 04:45, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Pronunciations ==

I think it would be helpful to include pronunciations for the major objects in the solar system on the corresponding pages (Planets, moons).  While most are fairly evident, Kuiper and Oort (among some of the moon names) are not.
:While a good idea for Wikipedia, I am not totally sure how far to go on a kids' book.  In addition, what sort of pronounciation guide/system should be used?  Embeding an .ogg file might have some value, but that is hard to display on a printed page (within the wiki would be just fine).  Using a standard &quot;dictionary&quot; pronounciation guide might look cool, but would kids be able to decypher it?  And what is the standard to go by?  Uranus, for example, has a couple of different pronounciations to use, mainly on emphasis (Your-anus...Ur-an-us...etc.) and this is also something that is strongly dependant on local dialect usage as well.  I am curious if the IAU has anything on this subject?  After some digging I havn't been able to find anything other than strictly the correct spelling of the moon or planet. [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:01, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)
::With the points you made, I think I'm starting to agree with you more.  My major line of thinking was that it would be valuable for children to be able to discuss with adults without feeling as though they might mispronounce something - though I guess this is something kids rarely worry about.  If we did decide to go with a pronunciation key I think it's a given that it would not be a standard dictionary pronunciation key - it'd have to be something geared toward kids based on words they are already familiar with.  I didn't think about the localization issue - I thought that there were standards on the subject but hadn't checked.  I'll see if maybe I can find anything later.

== Cool Facts ==

Could somebody help me writing here a list of cool facts about the Solar System? [[User:Carlos Hoyos|DrJones]] 10:32, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

*If we could weight the Sun, it would be X times heavier than all the planets together.(*)
*The light, the fastest thing in universe, takes 8 minutes to go from the Sun to Earth.
*The names of the planets correspond to Roman Deities.
*The Moon shows always the same face, as its period of rotation is the same as Earth.

(*) Being weight = mass * gravity, we only need to divide the mass of the Sun by the sum of the masses of all the planets to know how many times would the Sun be heavier than all the other planets on any gravity distinct of zero.

proof: sunmass*g / (m1*g)+(m2*g)+(m3*g) = sunmass*g / g*(m1+m2+m3) = sunmass / (m1+m2+m3)
where m1, m2, m3 are planet masses, g is any gravity distinct of zero, and sunmass is the mass of the Sun. [unsigned comments by [[User:Carlos Hoyos|Carlos Hoyos]]]

:That's nonsense.  That isn't what anybody means when they talk about the &quot;weight&quot; of the Sun or one of the planets or any other heavenly body, even going back to when British scientist [[w:Henry Cavendish]] reported his experiments in his famous paper, titled &quot;Weighing the Earth&quot;.

:There is no reason for any discussion of gravity in connection with this.  You can chose not to use the ambiguous term &quot;weight&quot; if you like; we have an alternative that is less ambiguous in this context (though it, too, has several different meanings in other contexts).  [[User:Metric1000|Metric1000]] 15:17, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

::This is indeed where mass alone really has any context.  The mass of the sun has a larger gravity well than the Earth or Jupiter by virtue of its substantially larger mass.  Weight in this context is meaningless and has no practical value.

::On the other hand, the &quot;Cool Facts&quot; for the various planets is a neglicted area of the articles, and there does need to be some more things for just about every article that would be something unique or interesting to think about for each celestial body in the solar system.  If there is a good artist, it would be nice for somebody to try and render a &quot;astronomical symbol&quot; for a Comet, and perhaps fix Uranus.  The symbol currently being used is more the traditional astrology symbol, for horoscopes and the like.  The astronomical symbol is more a dotted circle with an arrow pointing straight up.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:11, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

== Tables? ==

Should there be a page of multiple basic tables at the end of the book that shows data for the moons and planets? Names, symbols, diameters (both km and miles), masses (compared to Earth or Moon), densities (compared to ice), distances (from sun or planet), orbital periods, rotation periods, ... that sort of thing? That would allow a person reading the book to make comparisons between the different bodies. It's a pretty common feature of most books about the solar system. Thanks. &amp;mdash; [[User:RJHall|RJHall]] 21:46, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

:It would be nice to adapt [[w:Planet (Table)]] to Wikijunior.  If you are interested in taking on that task, '''Be Bold''' and add it to this Wikibook.

One thing to keep in mind that makes this site unique is that the content is available under the GFDL, so you can modify it to any form or format that you would like.

== TOC template ==

I propose (lame suggestion deleted by [[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]])

--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 20:30, 18 August 2005 (UTC)

:Before you delete this suggestion completely, I wanted to bring something up about an idea I had about the general organization of this Wikibook.  The current template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikijunior Solar System}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is very unwieldy, and if considerably more content is added, it would be almost impossible to &quot;find a home&quot; for the template on most pages.  It tends to push the images around and sometimes it destroys what I find to be an asthetically pleasing introduction to the topic (like the beginning of [[Wikijunior Solar System/Earth|the Earth article]]).  Because of that you have to move it further down the page.  Some articles I have had a very difficult time trying to add images that don't conflict with this navigation bar.&lt;p&gt;One other thing to keep in mind that when this Wikibook was started, this was only &quot;supposed&quot; to be about the major planets themselves, with a few &quot;extra&quot; artcles about other objects in the solar system.  My contention was that knowledge of the solar system has advanced so much that to merely talk about just the planets is doing a poor introduction to planetary astronomy (what this Wikibook really is about...frankly better than some college textbooks about this subject even though this is oriented toward 8-12 year olds).  That is why I pushed for the creation of seperate sections for major moons, and I feel that eventually several asteroids and a few comets might be useful as well, not to mention some information about the Kuiper belt objects that seem to be making notice lately in the mainstream (read non-astronomy/science magazines or newspapers) press.&lt;p&gt;I created a seperate template for navigation within the &quot;Mars system&quot;, and it was my intention to do the same thing with all of the other major planets.  I think this would work with the asteroids and perhaps even the &quot;extra questions at large&quot; section.  Keep in mind that none of these templates will ever be used in the print versions of this Wikibook, so this is mainly an aid to those who are using it on the web side.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:24, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

== Satisfy Educational Content Standards? ==

Would it be worthwhile to aim at some kind of Educational Content Standards for the target age group?  If so, which one(s).

Here's what I have learned recently about content standards:
* In the US there is no national standard.  The National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment, National Research Council, has proposed an outline for developing a set of[http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses/html/overview.html|National Science Education Standards]

*Also in the US, [http://www.pde.state.pa.us/stateboard_ed/cwp/view.asp?A=3&amp;Q=76716| Pennsylvania Educational Content Standards], including [http://www.pde.state.pa.us/k12/lib/k12/scitech.doc| Science and Technology] (astronomy in section 3.4.D).  I think we are missing a short discussion of how gravity each object whizzing around in its orbit.  I am ignoring equinoxes, calendars, seasons,  eclipses, constellations, and living in space, which are within the scope of &quot;astronomy&quot;(?living in space?) but outside the scope of this WikiBook on &quot;our solar system&quot;. With the addition of gravity, I think this book hits the PA standards well.  The remaining information could go in a another book &quot;Discovering Space&quot;.  The two would be essential companions.

== wrt the space exploration section ==

&quot;...space starts at about 100km (62m) above the earth.&quot; This 'boundary' is for legal reasons only, as far as I know. There is no sudden change in the constituents of the atmosphere, nor is there a sudden change in density or temperature, but simply a convenient figure to be defined as 'space' in treaties and, of course, in competitions such as the X Prize. Could this perhaps be expressed in the text? Or does anyone know a more scientifically reasoned border? Cheers, [[User:Mark Lewis|Mark Lewis]] 22:51, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
:I did a quick google on &quot;where does space begin&quot; and came up with http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/space/boundary.html 
&lt;pre&gt;The United States awards astronaut status to anyone who flies above 
50 miles in altitude. Many flight engineers, dealing with the effects of
friction and heating of spacecraft due to atmospheric particles, define 
the boundary to be at 400,000 feet (75.76 miles). They call this the 
&quot;entry interface,&quot; the point at which heating on reentry becomes observable.

== Length of this book ==

I see from the early-August PDF version of this book that it was already over 100 pages.  The Beck Foundation grant was for 48 page booklets, right?
We've got '''WAY''' more content than that!  Do we plow through until we are completely happy with the tome, then fork a Wikijunior Solar System booklet from it and slash and burn to get down to the &quot;correct&quot; number of pages?
--[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 18:16, 23 August 2005 (UTC)
:I agree. The font of the books will be bigger, and each page will have pictures and/or toons. There's no way we can fit so much information in 48 pages (including the GFDL). Could you start suggesting how many sections should have the book, and how many pages should each one have? That way, we could have a reference to work from. I suggest starting now this process on another page, and keep the other as complete as it is. [[User:Carlos Hoyos|DrJones]] 11:39, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
::I completely disagree.  There is some &quot;paring down&quot; that can be done as far as giving this to the Beck Foundation, particularly if all you want to do is just cover the basic 9 planets.  If that is going to take a &quot;fork&quot;, then so be it.  You can take the raw content here and do it yourself, which is certainly allowed according to the GFDL, but I think there is merit in having the content as detailed as it currently is right now on the web side, and perhaps encouraging more development work as well.  It also goes to show you that filling up 48 pages of matieral is not particularly difficult for this particular subject and IMHO the effort to make the formal publication for the Beck Foundation should be happening right now.  As far as the &quot;cartoon&quot; illustrations, I don't see any real effort to get that accomplished.&lt;P&gt;BTW, what is the status of the &quot;print version&quot; that the Beck Foundation wanted anyway?  Who is involved?  This seems like a dead proposal for now, and the PDF file was made in part to try and kick start the whole publication idea.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:44, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
:::First cut of 'toon voting just completed at [[m:Wikijunior_project_Nikki_character_designs#Least_favourite]].  [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] says he disagrees with [[User:Carlos Hoyos|DrJones]], but it sounds like you are both talking about starting work on a &quot;booklet&quot; version.  I agree that this is a good time for planning, but too soon for copying content. There is still a lot of work to be done on the &quot;big&quot; version.  Like writing to the grade level of the audience.  And fact-checking/adding citations (which demonstrate the facts have been checked as well as providing links to primary source material they can be retained in comments in the &quot;booklet&quot; version).  So I think it is too early to copy content to the &quot;booklet&quot; version. But we do have to think about it.  Do we reduce detail, or dump topics?  What's our total word-count budget? --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 14:39, 24 August 2005 (UTC)
::::I was talking about that. About the cartoons, I was merely stating that we should consider that they will also take up space on the booklet, not that they are more (less) important than the rest of the work. [[User:Carlos Hoyos|DrJones]] 15:27, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__
'''Savoiardi''' are a sponge-like cookie originally from the Aosta Valley of Italy in the Alps, once known as the Duchy of Savoy (whence its name is derived).  This Piemontese biscotti resembles [[Cookbook:Lady Fingers | lady fingers]], though they're about twice as thick.  Savoiardi also figure prominently in several desserts, including puddings and [[Cookbook:Tiramisù |tiramisu]], as they absorb liquids excellently.

== Ingredients ==
* 400 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] [[Cookbook:Flour|self raising flour]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:White Sugar|white sugar]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* the [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|juice]] of 2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]
* [[Cookbook:Powdered Sugar|powdered sugar]]
* pure [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla extract]]

== Procedure ==
# Beat the eggs, then add sugar, oil, vanilla, baking powder and lemon juice and stir until combined.
# Slowly mix in flour with a wooden spoon, continually adding until you have a very thick batter (you may need more or less flour).
# On a large flat surface, a cutting board or plate, sift powdered sugar.
# Using teaspoons, drop a walnut-sized ball of batter onto the sugar, roll into an oval over the sugar.
# Place rolls onto cookie pan covered with wax paper, cover rolls on pans with a single layer of wax paper.
# Place pans into the oven at 200°C (392°F).
# Bake between 5 and 15 minutes, until biscotti begin to golden.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* If you choose to buy Savoiardi in a store rather than make them be sure of the date they were made as they have a very short shelf life.
* Properly made Savoiardi should never be soft.
* Savoiardi are often enjoyed dipped in brandy and espresso coffee.

== Warnings ==
* Savoiardi absorb liquid very quickly. If too much liquid is absorbed then the cookie breaks and falls apart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following consultant's manual is a one-stop place to come for vital information related to the process of becoming and succeeding as an independent consultant.  The primary focus of the manual will be toward consultants living and working in the United States, or doing business with the United States.  As the content grows and there is interest from consultants in other countries, those individuals can add that content to this manual.  This manual is geared toward small, one- or two-person firms, rather than to larger consultant-type companies.  It covers a wide range of topics, including home offices and tax-related issues.

The road to becoming a consultant takes many twists and turns.  Some individuals have never had a formal education or background.  Others have had many years of experience in a related position, possibly as part of a larger consulting firm; some even have received advanced degrees, such as the MBA, or Master’s of Business Administration.  There is no one path which will guarantee success, nor is there clear guidelines for when and how to start an independent consultancy.

Here are a few of the many topics that will be covered:
#	Making the decision to be an independent consultant
#	Arranging your finances
#	Determining your speciality
#	Creating an identity
#	Business structure
#	Setting up a home office
#	Marketing
#	Delivering your services
#	Record keeping
#	Tax consequences
#	Strategic planning
#	Reference materials and other resources

Many other topics will be added as needed.  First and foremost, this is a business and should be treated as such.  Unless you are independently wealthy and doing consulting as a service to the community, one of your primary goals will be generating a profit.  Profit is not just the money received from your clients, it is the money which remains after expenses are paid.

Doesn't this recipe need milk or water or something? i think the batter would have the consistency of bread dough.

: I have not made this recipe as I am vegan, but there is a large amount of (melted) margarine and 2 eggs.. I think this probably sufficient for moisture in the recipe. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:32, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Well-defined cystic lesions located along the peripheral margin of the meniscus, nearly always associated with horizontal meniscal tears.

==Etiology==
Various etiologies have been proposed, including trauma,hemorrhage, chronic infection, and mucoid degeneration. The most widely accepted theory describes meniscal cysts resulting from extrusion of synovial fluid through a peripherally extended horizontal meniscal tear, accumulating outside the joint capsule. They arise more commonly from the medial joint margin, and occur most often in 20 to 40 year old males.

==Signs/Symptoms==
Pain and swelling or focal mass at the level of the joint. The pain may be related to a meniscal tear or distension of the knee capsule or both. The mass varies in consistency from soft/fluctuant to hard. Size is variable, and meniscal cysts are known to change in size with knee flexion/extension.

==Radiologic Findings==
MR imaging is the modality of choice for diagnosis of meniscal cysts. In their most subtle form, meniscal cysts present as focal areas of high signal intensity within a swollen meniscus. It is not uncommon for radiologists to miss this type of meniscal cyst because the signal intensity is not quite as bright as fluid on T2 weighted sequences.2 When this fluid is extruded into the adjacent soft tissues, the swollen meniscus subsequently assumes a more normal shape, and the extruded fluid demonstrates a relatively higher T2 signal typical of parameniscal cysts.

==Treatment==
Treatment of meniscal cysts consists of a combination of cyst decompression (intraarticular decompression versus open cystectomy) and arthroscopic repair of any meniscal abnormalities. Success rates are significantly higher when both the cyst and meniscal tear are treated compared to treating only one disease process.

Okay, I think I will do the tutorial, taking photos to illustrate what you are saying. And also if I have some difficulties, completing it. Anyway, it looks like a good tutorial ! Keep up the good work ( well me too :P ) -- '''Totophe64'''
----

Definately needs some images
----

I followed the tutorial exactly, but my particles look like translucent circles, instead of blending into one &quot;puff&quot;.

----

Is there any way to add a blurry heat effect to this? Not just limited to the fire, but for other models as well?

== Randomizing the initial velocity ==

To randomize only the norm of the initial velocity and not the direction, you can use a clouds texture.

* Give the emitter a material
* Create a texture for the material.
* Activate ''PAttr'' in the ''MapTo'' panel.
* Activat ''Life''.
* Set ''DVar'' to zero. 
* Use a clouds texture. 

This creates a scaling factor for the initial speed, so you have to give the particles initial speed another way (e.g. with the ''Normal'' value in the particle physics panel.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==
* 2 large red [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]]
* 2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Wine|red wine]]
* 1-2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Cheese|goat cheese]], 4 oz (115 g) (bouchon, crottin, or generic chevre -- a traditional goat cheese, not a cow-style one)
* [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], 1 lb (450 g) 
* [[Cookbook:Tabasco Sauce|Tabasco sauce]], to taste

==Procedure==
#Skin and finely [[Cookbook:Chop|chop]] or process the red peppers
#Place in saucepan &amp; cover with water
#Crush and add garlic (I leave the cloves in; some people may want to fish them out later)
#Cover and until [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmering]]
#Stir in wine and olive oil
# Add basil, oregano, and Tabasco, stirring occasionally at simmer; allow sauce to begin cooking down
# While you're doing this, make the pasta the usual way. Remember that the sauce only needs to take its sweet time to cook down.
# Cut the rind from the goat cheese; you only want the inner part for this.
# As soon as the pasta and sauce are ready, toss them, and the goat cheese, together in your serving dish. You have to do this fast, so the goat cheese will melt through the sauce and over the pasta. Stirring the goat cheese into the sauce could result in burned sauce.

''Serves 4.''

==Notes==
The above is what I made with what I had. It might be advantageous to remove the Tabasco and instead skin and process some Peppadew or habañero peppers (no more than four peppadews, no more than one habañero) with the bell peppers. If you're going to do this, though, remember that when doing something which will get hot pepper juice on your hands, you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before touching your eyes.

It might be an interesting experiment to add [[Cookbook:Vinegar|balsamic vinegar]] to the sauce when you add the wine.

It might also be interesting to use half as much sweet white wine instead of the red wine and skip the spicy ingredients, and garnish with [[Cookbook:Pine Nut|pine nuts]].

If you're interested in a prettier-looking dish, peel and process a large [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] with the peppers.

[[Cookbook:Sausage|Sausage]] would be a good accompaniment for this dish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm not sure about this:

&quot;The Intel 8051 is an 8-bit microcontroller which means that all the registers and data is of 8 bits.&quot;

I remember the DPTR (data pointer) and the timers to be 16 bit long. The suggested sentence is:



&quot;The Intel 8051 is an 8-bit microcontroller. This means that most operations are based on 8-bit registers and data. &quot;


Am I right?


Do u remember one thing that 8-bit microcontroller having 8-bit data bus &amp; 16-bit address bus...

== Why 8051? ==

Why 8051 is still in use today despite we have many advanced microprocessors?
First it is not microprocessor it is micro-controller &amp; secondly it is initial stage micro-controller hence we can get idea of how development begins from initial stage micro-controllers.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
There are two main reasons that bones receive radiotherapy: 1) an intentional delivery to bones to treat painful metastatic bone lesions or  2) their unavoidable inclusion into a radiation field which intends to treat an adjacent soft tissue neoplasm.  In either case, the effects on the bone are varied and depend upon:

#Dosage.
#Quality of the x-ray beam.
#Age of the patient.
#Method of fractionation (fractionating treatment enables the physician to give the patient the necessary treatment dose while separating its delivery by a time interval in order to reduce toxic side effects to normal tissue).
#Length of time of therapy.
#Specific bone or bones involved.
#Existence of trauma or infection at the site.


The main effects on the bone include:  disruption of normal growth and maturation, scoliosis, osteonecrosis, and neoplasm formation. 

==Growth Arrest and Disturbances==
Growth arrest, in general,  is believed to be caused by a combination of cellular injury to chondrocytes  and damage to the physeal blood vessels.  The epiphysis is the most sensitive area to radiation and it has been shown that delivery of a total of 20 Gy to immature bone can cause growth disturbance.  Radiotherapy can also increase the risk for epiphyseal plate trauma such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis.  

Radiation delivered to the metaphysis can cause bowing, fraying and sclerosis and look similar to rickets. 

The diaphysis is thought to be relatively more radioresistant and periosteal bone formation may be less affected than enchondral bone formation.  Nevertheless, when an entire bone is exposed to radiation, it will demonstrate narrowing of the shaft and an overall reduction in size and diameter.  




&lt;b&gt;Fig. 1&lt;/b&gt; Hypoplastic pelvis and lumbar scoliosis in a patient who received radiotherapy as a child.

==Scoliosis==

As with bone growth abnormalities in other areas of the body, the reason for radiation induced scoliosis are multifold.  In general, scoliosis induced by radiotherapy is thought to be mild and non progressive.  It affects the growing spine more severely than mature spine.  Children who are treated before the age of 2 show the largest degree of abnormality.   Uneven growth arrest, leading to curvature, was initially thought to be due to &quot;fall off&quot; at the edge of the x-ray beam and some investigators believed that irradiating the entire vertebral body equally would prevent scoliosis from developing.  This has not shown to be true, although asymmetric radiation is associated with more severe and more frequent deformities.   Changes can occur with doses of 10 Gy and higher and generally occur 9 to 12 months after treatment.

==Osteonecrosis==
In a mature skeleton,  &quot;growth damage&quot;  manifests as osteonecrosis.  Radiation necrosis is dose-dependant, with &quot;radiation osteitis&quot; seen at around 30 Gy and osteoradionecrosis associated with doses of  50 Gy or higher.  Radiation osteitis is a term used to describe potentially reversible changes such as temporary cessation of growth, periostitis, bone sclerosis and increased fragility, ischemic necrosis and infection.  Radiographs will show bone which is mottled demonstrating both osteopenia and sclerosis and areas of coarse trabeculation.  Some investigators and clinicians believe that radiation osteitis is the set-up for osteoradionecrosis and that a patient does not progress to necrosis unless infection is present.  

Others favor a &quot;cell death&quot; theory.   Recent evidence suggests that radiation induces osteoblasts to enter G2 cell cycle arrest and sensitizes them to agents which mediate their apoptosis.  Radiation induced vascular injury is also a likely culprit to the development of radiation osteitis and osteonecrosis.  Its role, however,  is debated.  

Changes are seen at different time intervals depending on which bone is irradiated. There are several bones which have characteristic complications which are listed below.

===Mandible===
Frequently the changes are seen within a year of treatment.  It is a more superficial bone, and therefore it inadvertently receives a larger dose during treatment of head and neck neoplasms.  One of the major concerns with osteoradionecrosis of the mandible is that can be very difficult to differentiate it from tumor recurrence.  Pain, ulceration, and bleeding can be present, but do little to determine the diagnosis as these symptoms are common to both entities.

===Pelvis===
Avascular necrosis of the femoral head can, of course, be seen.  In 2% of patients, fractures of the femoral head occur.  Protrusio acetabuli is also a reported complication.  Femoral neck fractures have been seen as early as 5 months after therapy and with as little as 16 Gy of radiation given.  The fractures generally heal with normal callous formation.  The SI joints may also be effected showing bilateral, symmetric sclerosis.

===Shoulder===
Frequently in the treatment of breast carcinoma, the shoulder receives radiation.  This can induce osteopenia and/or a coarse and disorganized pattern of trabeculation which looks like Paget's disease.  Rib, clavicular and scapular fractures are seen.  In some cases, there can be avascular necrosis of the humeral head.  

===Sternum===
Pectus excavatum can develop.  Other complications include osteopenia, disorganized trabecular pattern, and necrosis involving one or more sternal segments.

==Radiation-induced neoplasms==

Radiation-induced tumors in patients who receive radiotherapy before 2 years of age are usually benign. The most commonly reported  tumor in this group of patients is osteochondroma, and are thought to be induced with doses ranging from 16-64 Gy.

In patients who received radiotherapy during adulthood,  induced tumors are more likely to be malignant.  Osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma are generally considered to be the most common radiation-induced tumors in this population.  Chondrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma are also seen.  Specific criteria aid in diagnosing a radiation-induced sarcoma and are as follows:

#The sarcoma arises in an irradiated field.
#There is a 4 year latent period
#The sarcoma is histologically different from the original tumor and radiation was delivered in the absence of a diagnosis of the sarcoma.

Radiation-induced sarcomas have been shown to develop anywhere from 4 to 42 years after therapy.  The average latent period is 11 years.  The radiation doses associated with tumor development vary, but usually at least 30 Gy is needed.   As mentioned previuosly, tumor can sometimes be confused with osteonecrosis, as they can demonstrate similar symptoms.  In those cases, serial radiologic exams or biopsy may be needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
In order to have an ACL reconstruction, you first need to have an ACL tear.  Symptoms of an ACL tear include:  pivot shift episodes, pain, and feeling a 'pop.'  On physical exam, the physician usually finds an effusion, a positive anterior drawer sign, a positive Lachman's test, and/or a positive pivot shift test.  MR has a greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity for detecting a ruptured ACL (3).  Tears are best demonstrated on T2 MRI sequences.  The characteristics of ACL disruption are as follows:

*&lt;i&gt;incomplete ruptures&lt;/i&gt;: increased T2 signal, thickening, normal course; 
*&lt;i&gt;ruptured ACL&lt;/i&gt;: absence of intact fibers, high signal on T2;
*&lt;i&gt;chronic tears&lt;/i&gt;: ACL atrophy, laxity, normal or intermediate signal intensity, thickening.  

Joint space findings can also provide clues as to an ACL tear.  These include effusion, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) angulation, anterior subluxation, bone bruise, Segond fracture, uncovered lateral meniscus, deep femoral notch, MCL tear, and meniscal tear (2-3).

==Types of Reconstruction==
Today, reconstruction is usually done without an open knee surgery.  It is performed with arthroscopic assistance and running a graft through reamed tunnels in the tibia and femur.  The graft is generally anchored at both ends.  Graft materials are more often harvested from the patient, but cadaver grafts are still used in select patients.  Prior to graft placement, the existing torn ACL must be arthroscopically debrided out of the knee thoroughly.

One common method of reconstruction uses a central third patellar-tendon autograft.  The middle one third of the ipsilateral patellar tendon is harvested with bone plugs from the patella and tibial tuberosity.  The graft is inserted through femoral and tibial tunnels.  It is often secured by two metal or absorbable interference screws.  An animation of how this procedure is performed can be found here.  Follow the links for examples of how this reconstruction appears in AP and lateral plain x-rays (15).

Another method of reconstruction, favored at the University of Washington currently, uses a double loop graft of semitendinous and gracilis tendons.  In this procedure, portions of the hamstring tendons are dissected from their muscular insertion.  Their bony insertion remains intact.  The graft is then pulled through the tunnels and looped back over an Endobutton in the femur, thus becoming a double loop.   The lower portion is secured with a screw in the tibia. The  EndoButton is a metal flat washer (what we see on x-ray) attached to a loop of polyester tape through which the graft is run.  An animation of how this procedure is performed can be found here, except that an EndoButton is used instead of a screw to secure the loop in the femur.

==Causes of Failure and Complications of ACL Reconstruction== 

Causes of graft failure can be divided into three categories:  technical, biologic, and external (5).  Technical causes include nonanatomic tunnel placement, hardware failure, bone plug fracture, inadequate notchplasty, improper tensioning, graft fixation, and insufficient graft material.  Plain x-rays can be used to evaluate fracture of the bony portions of the grafts, metallic screw integrity and position, union of the bony portions of the graft, tunnel placement, and size of screw tunnels.  MR can also be used to evaluate tunnel positioning, graft integrity, the other soft tissues of the knee.  The femoral tunnel should be at the intersection of Blumensaat's line (intercondylar roof line) and a line extended from the posterior femoral cortex.  Tibial tunnel placement should be posterior and parallel to the tibial intersection of Blumensaat's line.  One of the more common problems with the tunnels is placement that is too anterior (15).  Tunnels may enlarge over time but this does not seem to affect outcome (1).  Screw placement does not necessarily correlate with the tunnel lines.  Osseous incorporation of the patellar tendon grafts occurs by one year in most cases (1, 11).  On MR, an intact unimpinged graft should have homogenous low signal.  It should be posterior to and not in contact with the intercondylar roof (14).  Grafts impinging on the roof or sidewall will have irregular increased signal (6).  Due to metal artifact on T2 images, T1 may be more useful for assessing technical failure (2).

Biologic causes for failure include:  failed ligamentization (for those grafts which were not originally ligaments), infection, arthrofibrosis, and infrapatellar contracture syndrome.  Arthrofibrosis is a loss of extension of more than 10 degrees or flexion of greater than or equal to 15 degrees.  It could be caused by a cyclops lesion.  This is a fibrous nodule anterolateral to the tibial tunnel that impinges on the intercondylar notch when the knee is extended.  It causes an abrupt endpoint of extension with a popping sensation.  The cyclops lesion could result from drilling debris, ACL stump remnants, broken graft fibers, or repeated impingement of the graft on the notch (4).  Adequate notchplasty (anterolateral debidement of the tibial tunnel) is required to reduce the rate of cyclops formation, which can occur in as many as 5-10% of patients (12).  A cyclops lesion is seen on MR as a low-signal intensity nodule outlined by fluid.

External causes for failure include:  traumatic rupture, secondary instability of the knee, and improper rehabilitation (5).  Graft rupture, similar to native ACL rupture, is best demonstrated on MRI as has been described (4).  Caution is advised when using secondary signs of ACL rupture since some of these are normal in a post-operative state, such as an effusion (1).

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common complication of ACL reconstruction and can be imaged by plain x-rays.  Changes usually can be seen by 7 years post-operative (8-9, 12).  A recent study showed that patellofemoral OA is more common than tibiofemoral OA (47% vs. 14-18%) an average of 7 years post-operative (7).  In this study, the patellofemoral OA corresponded in severity to degree of shortening of the patellar tendon.  The OA is more advanced in those patients for which the ACL injury was chronic (&gt; 12 weeks) prior to surgery and when meniscectomy was required (8-9, 12).  

Subsequent surgery is not an infrequent complication of ACL reconstruction.  Meniscectomy can later be needed in a small percentage of patients (9, 12).  Screw removal can also be required in as many as 10% of patients (9).  This might be necessary due to patient pain or that the screws may back out as the bone heals and affect cosmesis.  Debridement procedures could be required for adhesions, arthrofibrosis, or cyclops lesions.    

Other knee injuries can complicate an ACL repair.  These include associated tendon injuries, meniscal injuries requiring surgery, patellar tendonitis, patellar tendon rupture, and patellar fracture.  The latter three would be seen with the patellar tendon grafts.  Patellar fracture can be detected with plain x-rays.  Derangement of the soft tissues structures can be seen on MRI.

==Outcome==
Short term success of ACL reconstruction is generally very good.  Data is limited on long term success of many of the procedures employed today.  An additional traumatic injury seems to be the most common cause of reoperation now that many of the technical problems of the surgery have been perfected.  For patellar tendon grafts, approximately 4-10% have traumatic rupture in 5-7 years (9, 12).  

In the case of patellar tendon grafts, the central third of the patellar tendon reconstitutes after 12-18 months, as has been demonstrated by MRI (12).  The patellar tendon can remain increased in thickness.  Absorbable interference screws are generally resorbed by 1 year (1) and can be seen on MRI.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Also known as patellar tendinitis.  Relatively common cause of pain in the inferior patellar region in athletes. Begins as inflammation in the patellar tendon where it attaches to the patella and may progress by tearing or degenerating the tendon. Overuse injury from repetitive overloading of the extensor mechansism of the knee.  Microtears exceed the body's healing mechanism unless the activity is stopped.  Occurs in many athletes, but is most common in sports such as soccer, volleyball, or basketball which require explosive movements. Early stages may be treated conservatively. Uncommonly may require surgery to remove myxoid degeneration in the tendon. This is reserved for patients with debilitating pain for 6-12 months despite conservative measures. 

==Radiologic Findings==
Thickening of the proximal patellar tendon with high signal in/around the proximal patellar tendon on T2W images.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Anatomy==
The knee has two menisci, the medial and the lateral menisci.  They are C-shaped, fibrocartilaginous structures that are thick peripherally and thin centrally.  They function to increase the articular surface of the tibia, to deepen the flat tibial plateaus, in order to accommodate the relatively round femoral condyles.  The menisci function as shock absorbers and as passive stabilizers for the knee.  They are firmly attached to the tibia at their anterior and posterior portions.  

In the lateral meniscus, additional meniscofemoral ligaments can variably be found, extending from the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus to the medial femoral condyle.  If, on sagittal images, the ligament is anterior to the PCL, then it is the ligament of Humphrey; if it is posterior to the PCL, it is the ligament of Wrisberg.  

The lateral meniscus is attached to the joint capsule less intimately than the medial meniscus.  This increased mobility results in less injury to the lateral meniscus.  The anterior and posterior horns of the lateral meniscus are equal in size. 

==Clinical==
Symptoms of lateral meniscal tear include intermittent pain due to synovitis, locking, catching and clicking.  Although a lateral meniscal tear can be related to trauma, significant trauma is not necessary.  A sudden twist can cause a tear.  On exam, lateral joint line tenderness, effusion or limited range of motion can be found.  Provocative maneuvers can often reproduce the click or the pain of the tear.

==Imaging==
MR is the imaging study of choice to evaluate the menisci.  The normal meniscus is devoid of signal on all imaging sequences.  Proton density or T1 weighted coronal and sagittal images are the most accurate for evaluation of the menisci. 

The lateral meniscus tears less commonly than the medial meniscus.  A discoid lateral meniscus, which is thought to be a congenital variant, occurs much more commonly on the lateral meniscus.  A discoid meniscus can be symptomatic, in and of itself, causing joint locking and joint line tenderness.  The abnormal biomechanics of the discoid meniscus also makes it prone to tearing.  It is diagnosed on sagittal images, when 3 or more consecutive segments including the body are identified.  On coronal images, it is diagnosed when the horizontal measurement between the free margin and the periphery of the body is more than 1.4 cm.

A tear is diagnosed when there is increased signal within the meniscus that extends to the articular surface.  If there is increased signal within the meniscus that almost extends to the articular surface, but not quite, this is intrasubstance degeneration.

3 types of tears include:

1. &lt;i&gt;Horizontal/oblique tear&lt;/i&gt; -- most common type

2. &lt;i&gt;Vertical longitudinal tear&lt;/i&gt; -- this tear can also become a bucket handle tear if the medial fragment displaces.  The fragment can displace into the intercondylar notch or flip anteriorly.

3. &lt;i&gt;Radial tear&lt;/i&gt; -- this tear extends from the periphery to the free edge of the meniscus.

Parameniscal cysts are occasionally found and are highly associated with meniscal tears. They are more common in the lateral meniscus.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Anatomy==
The medial collateral ligament is typically divided into the superficial and deep bands. The superficial portion of the ligament typically arises from the medial femoral condyle and passes distally to insert approx. 5cm below the joint line and posterior to the pes anserinus on the medial aspect of the proximal tibia. Superficial fibers are separated from the deep fibers by a bursa.

The deep ligament is firmly attached to the capsule and the midportion of the medial meniscus and attaches to the femur and tibia adjacent to the joint. The medial collateral ligament is a stabilzer that resists external rotation and anterior forces and is more often injured than its lateral counterpart.

Click here for anatomy link for Medial Collateral Ligament anatomy from Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics.

==Pathophysiology==
This injury usually occurs when a blow to the outer side of the knee causes stretching or tearing of the medial collateral ligament. It can also be caused by twisting the knee. Specifically, the ligament is injured due to a valgus stress with the knee in flexion.

==Grading Injury==
TYPES OF MEDIAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT INJURY(GRADE I-III):

Three appearances of the MCL with T2 Weighted Images.

I. A sprain, shows high T2 signal in the soft tissues medial to the MCL.

II. A severe sprain or partial tear, shows high signal in the soft tissues medial to the MCL, but also has high signal or partial disruption of the MCL itself. As well, there can be thinning of the MCl itself.

III. A complete tear, shows complete disruption of the MCL.

==Associated Injuries==
Associated injuries  of the capsule specifically meniscocapsular separation, and can be diagnosed by noting fluid between the MCL and the medial meniscus. Additionally, injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament are also commonly seen with these injuries.

Commonly seen injury is so named the UNHAPPY TRIAD:

#ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT TEAR
#MEDIAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT INJURY
#MEDIAL MENISCUS TEAR

==Treatment==
Treatment of a medial collateral ligament injury rarely requires surgical intervention. Grade I sprains of the MCL usually resolve within a few weeks. Resting from activity, icing the inury and the use of anti-inflammatories will usually be all the treatment that is needed. 

When a grade II MCL sprain occurs, use of a hinged knee brace is common in early treatment. Athletes with a grade II injury can return to activity once they are not having pain over the MCL. When a grade III injury occurs, patients usually wear a hinged knee brace and protect weight-bearing with a gradual return to normal activities. Patients with more severe injuries usually require physical therapy and will not return to their full level of activity for 3 to 4 months.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first question is: why do you want to raise cattle?  What is your objective?  Maybe you just love cows.  Perhaps you're trying to fulfill a childhood fascination with cowboys and the Old West.  Some more practical reasons could be to provide a source of healthy more natural food (either dairy or beef) for your family, or to start a small side business to provide additional income.  There are many valid reasons, and you most likely have a combination of motivations.

Regardless of what your motivation is, it will be helpful in making future decisions and working through problems if you honestly know why you are trying to raise cattle.

There are many horse facilities that have limited acreage and are well suited for cattle raising.  However, there is no economic advantage to raising cattle on small acreage unless you have evolved your operation into one where you are selling embryos at a very nice premium.  However, a small ranching property that is too large to economically mow (such as 40 acres) may benefit from having cattle graze on it.  Many rural municipalities require that property owners control the weeds growing on their properties.  Having a small cattle operation can help in this.  Also some places having a minimum amount of cattle can qualify you for farming taxation which can be cheaper than leasing the property alone.

Because forage plays such a large part of the feeding regimen, cattle require two to three acres per animal on the small side in the southeast where temperatures allow for a spring and fall forage growing program.  Going in any other geographical direction requires even larger land to cattle ratios and the feeding program becomes a financial drain that can be unmanageable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Avulsion fracture of the lateral tibial plateau immediately distal to the articular surface. Originally described by Dr. Paul Segond in 1879 after a series of cadaveric experiements, the Segond fracture occurs in association with ACL tears (75-100%) and medial meniscal injury (66-75%), as well as injury to the posteriolateral knee structures. 

Originally thought to be a result of avulsion of the medial third of the lateral collateral ligament, more recent research suggests that the insertion of the iliotibial tract (ITT) and the anterior oblique band (AOB), a ligamentous attachment of the fibular collateral ligament to the midportion of the lateral tibia, also play an important role.

A rare, mirror image of the Segond fracture has also been described. The so-called &quot;reverse Segond&quot; fracture is comprised of avulsion fracture of the tibial component of the medial collateral ligament in association with posterior cruciate ligamentous injury and medial meniscal tears.

==Mechanism==
Segond fracture is typically the result of abnormal varus stress and internal rotation. Reverse Segond fracture, as its name suggests, is caused by abnormal valgus stress and external rotation. 

==Clinical Significance==
Because of the high rate of associated ligamentous and meniscal injury, the presence of a Segond or reverse Segond fracture requires these other pathologies must be specifically ruled out.

==Radiologic Findings==
Segond and reverse Segond fractures are characterized by a small avulsion fragment of characteristic size that is best seen on plain radiography in the AP plane. Nonetheless, the avulsion fragment may be very difficult to see, and the only direct imaging evidence of this pathology may be by MRI. MRI findings include improved visualization of the fracture fragment on T1W images and marrow edema of the underlying tibial plateau on fat saturated T2W and STIR images, as well as the associated findings of meniscoligamentous injury.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Anatomy and Function==


*Its &lt;b&gt;origin&lt;/b&gt; is on the anterior portion of the popliteal groove on the lateral surface of the lateral femoral condyle (anterior &amp; inferior to LCL origin) and another less strong origin is from the fibular head, called the popliteofibular ligament. An additional origin from the lateral meniscus can be seen in a small percent of patients. 
*The popliteus tendon &lt;b&gt;courses&lt;/b&gt; under the lateral collateral ligament, descends into the popliteus hiatus, then passes under the arcuate ligament and becomes extraarticular before finally joining its muscle belly 
*Its &lt;b&gt;insertion&lt;/b&gt; is fan like on the posterior surface of the tibia above the popliteal line 
*Its primary &lt;b&gt;function&lt;/b&gt; is internal rotation of the tibia on the femur in the non weight-bearing state &amp;, when weight-bearing, external rotation of the femur on the leg. It helps with posterior stability of the knee in preventing posterior translation of the tibia on the femur &amp; prevents excessive external and varus rotation of the tibia during knee flexion.  It is the main lateral stabilizer of the knee.

==Posterolateral Region==
*The posterolateral region of the knee is often seen as a functional tendoligamentous unit, which is termed the arcuate ligament complex. 
*This complex encompasses the popliteus muscle and tendon along with the lateral collateral ligament; biceps femoris tendon; popliteal meniscal and popliteal fibular ligaments; oblique popliteal, arcuate, and fabellofibular ligaments; and lateral gastrocnemius muscle. 
*Injuries of the popliteus are infrequent and rarely isolated (less than 10%).  They usually occur as part of a posterolateral corner complex injury, which is also frequently associated with injury of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligament.  
*It is important not to overlook popliteus and posterolateral injury in the presence of an anterior or posterior cruciate ligament injury, because the reconstructed cruciate ligament will likely fail without repair of the posterolateral injuries. 
*Unrepaired popliteus injuries can cause severe disability from both instability and articular cartilage degeneration.

==Mechanism of Injury==
*Athletic trauma, motor-vehicle accidents,and falls are the most common causes of injury of the posterolateralcorner of the knee. 
*Rare isolated posterolateral injury can result when a force is directed in a posterolateral direction against the proximal anteromedial aspect of the tibia with the knee at or near full extension, which produces knee hyperextension and varus bending that disrupts the posterolateral structures. 
*Combined hyperextension and tibial external rotation forces can also produce posterolateral injury. 
*Usually these forces are so severe orcombined with other forces to injure other ligaments in the knee. 
*The varus and hyperextension instability that results is frequently overlooked at clinical examination or masked by more extensive injury symptomatology. 

==Radiographic Evaluation==
*Radiographs with posterolateral injury may show abnormal widening of the lateral joint space, an arcuate fracture of the fibular head, avulsion of the Gerdy tubercle off the tibia, or a Segond fracture (avulsion of the lateral aspect of the capsule from the tibial plateau). 
*Although a Segond fracture is usually considered indicative of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament, it also occurs in association with isolated posterolateral injury.

===MR Evaluation===

At MR imaging, popliteus lesions have different appearances depending on the level and grade of damage. They may appear as an avulsion of the popliteus tendon from its femoral attachment, as an irregular contour of the tendon at the popliteal hiatus with surrounding high-signal-intensity edema, or as swelling and high-signal-intensity changes within the popliteus muscle. A complete popliteus tendon tear may be seen as an interruption and possibly as retraction of the muscle belly, which may appear as a &quot;mass&quot; surrounded by fluid. Only fat should be present behind the popliteus tendon. Therefore, the presence of fluid posterior to the tendon should suggest a capsular tear if the existence of a fluid-filled popliteal bursa is taken into account. 

The majority of popliteus tears are extraarticular, involving the muscular or myotendinous portion, although they can be intraarticular at the level of the popliteal hiatus and at or near the femoral insertion. Such injuries can also be a mixture of intraarticular and extraarticular

 

The popliteal bursa is an extraarticular extension of the synovial membrane of the knee joint extending from the popliteal hiatus along the proximal part of the popliteus tendon. On T2-weighted images, a fluid-filled popliteal bursa appears as a well-defined area of high signal intensity surrounding the popliteus muscle and tendon. This bursa may be confused with a tear of the popliteus muscle and tendon or of the posterior capsule. 

In 95.8% (23/24) of patients, the tears of the popliteus involved the muscular portion.  Three patients had tears of both the muscular and tendinous portions or the tendon alone. The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were torn in 16.7% (4/24) and 29.2% (7/24) of patients, respectively. There were medial and lateral meniscal tears in 45.8% (11/24) and 25% (6/24) of patients, respectively. There were injuries of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments in 8.3% (2/24) and 4.2% (1/24) of patients, respectively. Bone bruises and/or fractures were seen in 33.3% (8/24) patients. In 8.3% (2/24) of patients, the popliteus injury was an isolated finding.  

Avulsion injuries at the femoral insertion of the popliteus tendon have been reported. However, injuries of the muscle belly and myotendinous junction of the popliteus are far more common.  Enlargement of the muscle and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images can be demonstrated at MR imaging. MR imaging is also useful for differentiation of partial interstitial tear from complete muscle rupture, since the latter produces retraction and clumping.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
First, we will review some basic concepts necessary to evaluate traumatic injuries of the pediatric elbow.  Then, we will cover the most common injuries that you are likely to encounter in this population and discuss the incidence, mechanism of injury, diagnosis and treatment for these injuries.

==Ossification Centers of the Elbow==
Knowledge of the order and ages of appearance of the ossification centers of the elbow is essential in differentiating fractures from normal ossification centers in the pediatric elbow.  A simple mnemonic, &lt;b&gt;CRITOE&lt;/b&gt;, can be used to remember the sequence of appearance.

&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;ssification centers - Approximate age of appearance

&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;apitellum - 1 year

&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;adial head - 5 years

&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;nternal epicondyle (Medial epicondyle) - 7 years

&lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;rochlea - 10 years

&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;lecranon - 10 years

&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;xternal epicondyle (Lateral  epicondyle) - 11 years

Note: Females tend to have an earlier appearance of ossification centers by 1-2 years.



==Fat Pad Sign==

There are two fat pads within the elbow which are helpful clues in the evaluation of traumatic injuries of the elbow.  Normally, on a lateral radiograph of the elbow, the anterior fat pad is seen as a small triangular lucency anterior to the distal humeral diaphysis.  The posterior fat pad is ordinarily not visualized on a lateral radiograph because it is tucked away in the olecranon fossa.  With fractures, the joint becomes distended with blood.  The anterior fat pad becomes displaced superiorly and outward from the humerus giving the so called &quot;sail sign.&quot;  The posterior fat pad gets displaced out of the olecranon fossa and becomes visible on the lateral radiograph.  However, the fat pad sign can be seen with any joint effusion, making clinical history essential in the evaluation.  In the setting of trauma, effusions are indicative of fractures about the elbow.  


==Common Fractures==

===Supracondylar Fracture===

Supracondylar fractures make up 60% of all fractures about the elbow in the pediatric population.  There are two types of supracondylar fractures based on the mechanism of injury.  Of those, 96% are extension type fractures and 4% are flexion type fractures.  We will discuss the extension type injury as it is, by far, the more common.  These injuries are usually seen in skeletally immature patients in the first decade of life.  

The extension type fracture is caused by a fall on the outstreched hand with the elbow hyperextended.  The distal fragment of the humerus will angulate and displace posteriorly, depending on the severity of the trauma.  There is a relatively high risk of nerve injury (approximately 10% of fractures) associated with this injury.  When there is nerve injury, the radial nerve is most commonly involved followed by the median nerve, and then the ulnar nerve.

Radiological evaluation of these fractures can be difficult depending on the amount of displacement.  The use of the fat pad sign is very helpful.  Additionally, one should look for the anterior humeral line intersection with the capitellum.  The anterior humeral line is drawn along the anterior humerus on a true lateral radiograph.  Normally, this line intersects the middle third of the capitellum.  In supracondylar fractures, the line often intersects the anterior third of the capitellum or beyond.

Treatment depends on the amount of angulation or displacement that is present.  In most non-displaced fractures, patients are immobilized for approximately three weeks and reassessed.  However, depending on the amount of angulation, the patient may require reduction and percutaneous fixation.  In completely displaced fractures, closed reduction with percutaneous pinning is the most common treatment option.

===Lateral Condyle Fracture===

Lateral condyle fractures are the second most common fractures about the elbow in the pediatric population, encompassing approximately 15% of fractures.  

Two mechanisms of injury have been proposed.  First, the injury may result from a fall on the outstretched hand with the forearm supinated which transmits a force through the forearm extensor musculature to its attachment on the lateral condyle.  These fractures may also occur with a force directed to the outstretched hand with the elbow flexed.

The fracture can be easily identified radiographically if the capitellum is well ossified and displaced.  In more difficult cases, oblique radiographs may assist in the diagnosis.

Nondisplaced fractures may be treated by immobilization for approximately three weeks.  However, frequent radiographs must be obtained to ensure that the fracture does not displace during the immobilization.  To insure that the fracture does not displace, closed pinning of the fracture may be performed.  Anatomic reduction is essential in these fractures because they are intra-articular and involve the growth plate.  Therefore, displaced fractures are usually treated with open reduction and internal fixation.  

===Medial Epicondyle Fracture===

Medial epicondyle fractures are the third most common fracture about the elbow in the pediatric population encompassing approximately 10% of fractures.  These are typically seen in an older age group, most commonly adolescent males.

This injury results from a valgus force combined with contraction of the forearm flexor muscles.  If the valgus force is great enough, elbow dislocation can result, in addition to avulsion of the medial epicondyle.

Radiographic diagnosis is not difficult in displaced fractures.  In non-displaced fractures, the apophysis of the medial epicondyle may appear wider than normal.  Comparison with the contralateral side will often be helpful in these situations.  Additionally, some have recommended obtaining stress views to determine the stability of the elbow in these injuries.

Treatment of this fracture depends on the amount of displacement of the epicondyle.  Nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures (&lt;5 mm) can be treated with immobilization of the elbow and 90 degrees of flexion for approximately one week.  Treatment of displaced fractures is controversial.  If there is instability in addition to the fracture, open reduction and internal fixation is the treatment of choice.  If there is no instability, these fractures can be treated with closed reduction.  

===Proximal Radius Fracture===

This is the most common fracture about the elbow in adults.  However, proximal radius fractures encompass only about 8% of fractures in the pediatric population.  These fractures also differ from those seen in adults because they usually involve the radial neck and physis rather than the radial head, as in adults.

These injuries can result from a fall on the outstretched hand with the elbow extended.  In the skeletally immature, the force is transmitted through the head which is mostly cartilage, and directed to the physis and metaphysis.   These fractures may also occur in association with posterior dislocation of the elbow.   

Displaced fractures are usually easily diagnosed on radiographs.  However, non-displaced fractures can be difficult to visualize radiographically.  Oblique views of the radius may be helpful.

The treatment of this fracture depends on the amount of angulation.  In minimally angulated fractures, patients can be treated with immobilization in 90 degrees of flexion for approximately one week.  With greater angulation, the fracture is treated with closed or percutaneous reduction.  Open reduction is reserved for situations where closed or percutaneous reduction fails.

==Other Traumatic Injuries of the Pediatric Elbow==

===Dislocation of the Elbow===

Dislocation of the elbow is rare in children.  The mechanism of injury is a posteriorly directed force.

Closed reduction of the dislocation should be performed as soon as possible.  First, any lateral displacement is corrected.  Then, the arm is supinated and distal traction is applied with the patient's elbow flexed.  Following reduction, the elbow is immobilized for 2-3 weeks.

===Radial Head Dislocation===

Isolated dislocation of the radial head is extremely rare.  In the pediatric population, it is most likely due to bending of the ulna.  Most dislocations of the radial head are associated with a fracture of the ulna, the Monteggia fracture-dislocation injury.

Diagnosis can be made on lateral radiograph by examination of the radiocapitellar line and its intersection with the capitellum.  The radiocapitellar line is created by bisecting the proximal radial shaft.  This line normally intersects the capitellum in all radiographic projections.  If it does not, the radial head is subluxed or dislocated.  Radial head dislocations are treated with reduction.

===Subluxation of the Radial Head===

This is the most common traumatic injury of the elbow in children.  It is also known as &quot;pulled elbow&quot; or &quot;nursemaid's elbow.&quot;  The average age of incidence is 2-4 years.  As children get older, the annular ligament gets thicker and resists tearing, making this injury less likely.

The injury results from a pull on the extended pronated arm.  The annular ligament tears at its attachment to the radius and the radial head moves distally.  As the traction is relieved, the annular ligament gets caught between the radial head and the capitellum.  

The diagnosis is a clinical one.  Radiographs can be obtained to rule out other injuries.

Treatment entails reduction of the subluxation by forcefully supinating the forearm with the elbow flexed 60 to 90 degrees.  The child should be observed following reduction as he/she should use the arm shortly after the subluxation is reduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
The wrist, with its enormous range of motion, is one of the most complex and frequently used joints within the human body.  However, because of the prominent role it plays in normal daily activities, the wrist can oftentimes wind up being a source of significant disability and pain.

The proximal bones of the wrist (scaphoid, lunate, and triquetram) have no muscular attachment.  As a result, their main purpose is to stabilize the wrist joint and provide a focal plane to help transmit the force generated by the flexors and extensors of the arm.
 
To help them in this task, numerous strong ligaments bind the proximal bones together, allowing them to function more cohesively.  Damage to any of these ligaments results in either acute symptoms or a less noticeable but possibly more dangerous malalignment of the carpal bones that, if left uncorrected, will accumulate abnormal wear and tear -- eventually leading to severe and debilitating osteoarthritis.

Ligamentous injuries and subsequent carpal instability tend to occur in young and middle aged patients.  This is because as people age, their bones become more fragile and thus trauma in the elderly tends to cause outright bone fractures instead of soft tissue damage.  The most frequently encountered ligamentous injury of the wrist is scapholunate instability.

Three main ligaments bind the Lunate and Scaphoid bones together:
*Volar radioscapholunate ligament
*Scapholunate interosseous ligament
*Dorsal scapholunate ligament

Scapholunate instability is defined as significant injury to two or more of these ligaments.

==Cause==
Scapholunate instability is usually caused by stress placed on a hyperextended wrist, especially in ulnar deviation (such as frequently happens when patients fall on an outstretched hand).  When this occurs, the ligaments binding the scaphoid and lunate bones begin to tear, starting with the scapholunate interosseous ligament.
 
When a ligamentous wrist injury occurs, patients will generally describe one or more of the following symptoms:

*Pain 
*Weakness 
*&quot;Giving way&quot; 
*A &quot;clunk, snap, or click&quot; during use

One of the easiest ways to evaluate these patients is with a simple physical exam maneuver known as the Watson test.
 
==Watson Test==
A painful snap is obtained when pressing hard on the scaphoid tubercle volarly and moving the wrist from ulnar to radial deviation, the wrist being maintained in axial compression.  If clinical suspicion is high, further evaluation with imaging studies can be done.

==Radiologic Diagnosis==

As the ligaments binding the scaphoid and lunate bones are damaged, the scaphoid begins to move out of its normal position and rotationally sublux.  This leads to several noticeable findings on radiographic examination.

On AP plain films of the wrist, an abnormally large gap between the scaphoid and lunate bones can oftentimes be seen.  This is known as the Terry Thomas sign, in reference to the British comedian with a sizeable gap between his two front teeth (or David Letterman or any other person with a gap in their teeth, sign).

===AP Wrist===
&lt;center&gt;



&lt;/center&gt;
Generally, a scapholunate interval of &gt; 2mm is suspicious and &gt; 4 mm is virtually diagnostic for scapholunate dislocation or instability.

===Lateral Wrist===

Lateral X-rays of scapholunate instability may also demonstrate an increased capitolunate angle &gt; 15 degrees as well as increased scapholunate angle &gt; 60 degrees.


===Arthrography===

While fairly sensitive, plain films will sometimes fail to see the early signs of scapholunate instability when the ligaments are torn but the scaphoid has yet to sublux.  In these situations when suspicion is high, or when plain films have already detected the dislocation and further evaluation is needed to plan treatment, arthography is the next logical step in radiologic evaluation.

The wrist can be divided into three discrete compartments with ligamentous borders that prohibit the movement of fluid from one compartment to the next.  The scapholunate ligaments comprise part of this border and any tear can be diagnosed on arthrography when contrast injected into one compartment can be seen abnormally flowing into a neighboring compartment.  

However, while often diagnostic, contrast leakage does not always signal a significant tear within the ligaments but instead may only represent a ligamentous perforation without significant consequences.  If this is suspected to be the case, contrast injection can be coupled with CT scan or MRI of the joint to directly assess the health of the carpal ligaments.  Furthermore, CT scan or MRI can directly determine the site and length of ligament tears and is a critical tool when planning any surgical repair.

 

==Treatment==
Because scapholunate injuries can sometimes present without symptoms yet if left untreated can eventually result in further carpal derangement and debilitating osteoarthritis, prompt diagnosis and repair is extremely important.

If the injury is thought to be minimal, conservative treatment with splinting and NSAIDS can be used to provide symptomatic relief.  However, any significant degree of injury necessitates surgical correction.  
 
The overall aim of surgery is to restore a normal orientation of the scaphoid with the proximal pole appropriately articulating with the radius and to correct any other abnormalities that have occurred if the original injury was undiagnosed and uncorrected.

Numerous surgical techniques have been described, but generally revolve around soft tissue repair, where the carpal ligaments are modified or restored, or limited carpal arthrodesis, where the wrist bones are either orthopedically fixed or fused.  

If scapholunate insufficiency is left untreated long enough, further shifts of the carpal bones can occur, eventually leading to a syndrome known as scapholunate advanced collapse, or SLAC:

As the scaphoid moves further from the lunate, the normal load-bearing ability of the capitolunate joint disappears.  Among other things, this results in the migration of the capitate bone proximally, driving a further wedge between the scaphoid and lunate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
An unusual dislocation at the sternoclavicular joint that is usually the result of compressive forces on the shoulder girdle. The forces of posterior compression transmit through the fulcrum of the costoclavicular ligament and result in posterior dislocation. Alternatively, a direct blow to the anteromedial clavicle can result in posterior dislocation.

Classically described in American football players who get &quot;dog piled&quot; while in a lateral position. Our case happens to be a rugby player who sustained a tackle injury. It can certainly happen in a MVC when the forces are just right.

People who sustain this unusual injury can also sustain some pretty serious associated injuries. These include:
#Direct trauma to the great vessel origins, or brachiocephalic vein. Mediastinal hematoma is usually present.
#Respiratory distress from compression on the trachea.
#Voice change from compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
#Pneumothorax

==Radiologic Findings==
Special plane film views are described, but few people know these, and even fewer can read them. CT is the modality of choice because it delineates the anatomy of the joint so well. It also demonstrates the degree of separation, and can also show additional diagnoses. (see associated injuries)  If clinical suspicion is high... go directly to CT.

==Case==
A young rugby player who sustained an injury (takcle?), and complained of severe sternum pain. Interestingly, he later complained of some dysphagia.

Our patient underwent closed reduction of the dislocation with good results. He did not have one of the serious complications listed above. I guess the dysphagia resolved.

TFCC was first described in 1981 by Werner and Palmer as the ligamentous and cartilaginous structures that suspend the distal radius and ulnar carpus from the distal ulna. It is the major ligamentous stabilizer of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) and the ulnar carpals. 

==Functions==
*Provides for a continuous gliding surface for flexion-extension and translational movements of the forearm and for stable rotational movements of the radiocarpal unit about the ulnar axis. 
*Suspends the ulnar carpus from the dorsal ulnar face of the radius and cushions the forces directed through the ulnocarpal axis.

==Mechanisms of Injury to TFCC==
*falls onto pronated hyperextended wrist 
*twisting w/ palmar rotation
*forced ulnar deviance, such as batting a baseball, subjects the TFC  to heavy loads
*associated with distal radius fractures
*ulnocarpal impaction syndrome (see below)

==Symptoms==
TFCC injuries cause ulnar-sided wrist pain, frequently with clicking or crepitus and tenderness between the ulna and triquetrum. 

==Ulnocarpal Impaction Syndrome==
Ulnocarpal Impaction Syndrome is impingement of distal ulna on carpi which may arise from positive ulnar variance or non union of distal ulnar fracture. It is a common inciting cause of degenerative tears. (Note: those with positive ulnar variance can develop TFCC tears, and those with TFCC tears often demonstrate positive ulnar variance.) Patients with a torn TFCC display positive ulnar variance (radial shortening) on average 4.6 mm versus 2.5 mm for no tear and dorsal angulation of 24° versus 12° for no tear.
*increased ulnar variance leads to loading of the ulnocarpal joint and resultant lunotriquetral disruption, lunate chondral lesion, and triangular fibrocartilage complex tears
*during marked ulnar deviation, compressive load on TFCC, particularly w/ positive ulnar  variance, may increase markedly         

==Radiologic Findings==
*may show flattening, subchondral sclerosis or cysts, and/or lytic changes in lunate and/or triquetrum with similar changes  seen over the distal ulna
*patients may have positive ulnar variance
*in subtle cases, a pronation grip radiograph may demonstrate ulnar variance





&lt;b&gt;Figures 1 and 2.&lt;/b&gt; Note the positive ulnar variance  and lunotriquetral impaction on this patient. There are subchondral cysts in the ulnar styloid, indicating degenerative changes from chronic impaction. Subsequent contrast injection into the DRUJ has extravasated into the radialcarpal joint, indicating TFCC tear. 




&lt;b&gt;Fig. 3&lt;/b&gt; Note in this patient that the contrast injected into the midcarpal joint has extravasated into the radialcarpal joint and DRUJ, indicating tear of the TFCC.




&lt;b&gt;Fig. 4&lt;/b&gt; Another patient with ulnar impaction syndrome. Note the degenerative changes (osteophytes and subchondral cysts) in the distal ulna, scaphoid and lunate (white arrows), along with positive ulnar variance.

== Other Language Libraries ==

The IO Pages in &quot;Other Language Libraries&quot; are misplaced sinces there are two hooks allready. One in &quot;Predefined Language Library&quot; (Entry &quot;Ada&quot;) and one in &quot;Language Features&quot; (Entry &quot;Input Output&quot;).

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 13:45, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== AI302 ==

since [[Programming:Ada:Packages:Ada]] already allow for Ada 2005 I don't think that the AI302 need to be described.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 14:01, 25 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Added to bookshelf ==

I have taken the liberty to add the book to the IT bookshelf on the [[Main_Page|main page]] of WikiBooks. I rated it 50% = Maturing. --14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== mention tasking earlier? ==

Shouldn't the section &quot;Conclusion&quot; mention that Ada provides the means to get tasking right by offering language means? Maybe in the paragraph on the advantages of spec/body, strong/weak typing.

(I'm not in a position to add such things :-)
-- Georg

: Shure. Anyone to voleteer? (I'm currently involved in adding more chapters since there are more voleteers for improving existing chapters then for creating new ones.)

: BTW: Good work on [[Programming:Ada:Subtypes]]

=== Development stage ===

: I've upgraded the development stage of the book to 75%, and also using the templates described at [[Help:Development stages]]. It has to be marked in the following places:
:* [[Template:Computer Science bookshelf]] (appears in [[Computer Science]])
:* [[Programming languages bookshelf]]
:* [[Programming:Ada]]

== Sorting in category ==

Currently almost all the pages in [[:Category:Ada programming language]] are sorted by the page name, so all appear at P heading. By adding &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Ada programming language|key]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; we can sort by the key. I think the key should usually be  the second or the last word in the title to get a kind of index of terms in the book. Another category could be used to sort by a chapter number in order to get a kind of table of contents. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 00:29, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

: For the second word I meant all the string after stripping Programming:Ada, i.e. I think there are two possibilities for the key of [[Programming:Ada:Libraries:Container:Booch]]:

: # Libraries:Container:Booch
: # Booch

: The question is whether we want to put together full branches or want to sort by concrete items. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 00:57, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:: I did not know that - otherwise I would have made all category links like that. Anyway: concrete items! There will be some very large branches - like the pragma or attribute branch. And there is the &quot;least suprise&quot; argument: concrete is allwas concrete.

::# Libraries:Container:Booch
::# Container:Booch
::# Booch

:: --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 08:26, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

::: MediaWiki is full of magic! I agree with you about the concrete stuff.  BTW, we have a Spanish wikibook on Ada. I will probably pick some ideas from this one for the other and I hope, viceversa. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:32, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:::: I'm creating stubs for every keyword that don't have an article yet. I'm agree that for the Ada programming language Category the best option is to sort with the name of the keyword. But for the Ada unfinished article I thinl it should be better to sort with the key &quot;Keywords:'''id'''&quot; so anyone who goes to that category to complete articles can see how many keywords needs to be done, and so on. I think it could be done also with other pages that are in that category, like &quot;Special&quot; ones. Of course, the same policy for the Ada unfinished article category. What do you think? --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 21:31, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Note that Wiki categegories are case sensitive (thank you Martin for pointing me this!), so &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Category:Ada programming language|&lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;rocedure&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is not the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Category:Ada programming language|&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;rocedure&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The later is the preferred form. --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 14:35, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::: I've classified [[Programming:Ada]] at &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Category:Ada programming language| &lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (modified the key: Ada -&gt; blank space) because it is the main page (it's more visible this way than at the &quot;A&quot;). --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 14:35, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Things to look out for ==

I think this text might be better in [[Programming:Ada:Basic]] - in front of the hello world.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 20:44, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:I agree, it's too large for the main page. Maybe language history should be separated in a different page too. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 21:36, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:: I was thinking that too. Mind you - most of history is copied from wikipedia - so we might just refear to wikipedia anyway --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 04:33, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:::It might be, I don't see a clear way for they to evolve differently. Maybe this version might be more informal and concise? By the way, in Wikipedia we have the policy of mentioning in the Summary field from what page has been copied something. This is aimed to track changes and recognize  the contributions to its original authors (although an unregistered user does not seem to request too much credit, as is this case).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Coding conventions ==

IMHO, this book should follow the standard coding conventions, e.i. the style of the RM examples: 
* Keywords are in boldface
* Identifiers in mixed case, with two exceptions:
** When interfacing with other languages (like in packages &lt;tt&gt;Interfaces.C&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Interfaces.COBOL&lt;/tt&gt;)
** In Ada 83 every language element was written in upper-case (identifiers, attributes, pragmas...) except keywords.
* Identifiers of named types do not start with ''&quot;T&quot;'' or always end with ''&quot;_Type&quot;'' or ''&quot;_T&quot;'' (altough the latter is used sometimes, for example in formal parameters of generics, it is not a naming convention for every type).
* A named access type of another named type has the same name ended with ''&quot;_Ref&quot;'', or with ''&quot;_Ptr&quot;'' if it is a general access type.
* The keywords &lt;tt&gt;{{Ada/kw|is}}&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;{{Ada/kw|then}}&lt;/tt&gt;... go at the end of the line, and not at the start.
*...
You know, the old style. That is:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Person;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object {{Ada/kw|with}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Skilled_In : Language_List;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Abstract_Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|tagged}} {{Ada/kw|null}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Class_Member_1 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}}     Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Class_Member_2 (This :    {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Class_Member_3 (This : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} Object;
                              That :    {{Ada/kw|out}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Class_Member_4 (This : {{Ada/kw|access}} Object);
    {{Ada/kw|function}}  Class_Member_5 {{Ada/kw|return}} Object;
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Programmer;

Some projects use a different code convention (it's only a convention after all), but I think in a tutorial like this we should teach the standard one. The [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat-style/ GNAT Coding Style Manual] specifies this convention in more detail, altough introduces some rules like:
* When the &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;elsif&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; keywords do not fit on the same line with the condition and the &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt; keyword, &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt; should be aligned with &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;, and conditions should preferably be split before an &lt;tt&gt;and&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;or&lt;/tt&gt; keyword.
* The same rules applies to while loops (the &lt;tt&gt;loop&lt;/tt&gt; keyword aligned with the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt;), subprogram definition (ditto with the &lt;tt&gt;is&lt;/tt&gt; keyword)...
* &lt;s&gt;When a big sentence must be split, put the operator not at the end of that line but at the start of the next one.&lt;/s&gt;
For example:

 {{Ada/kw|while}} long_condition_that_has_to_be_split
       {{Ada/kw|and}} {{Ada/kw|then}} continued_on_the_next_line
 {{Ada/kw|loop}}
    ...
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};

It also introduces some awkward rules relating to comments, for example, but I think this style manual is a good start, and can be applied even to new Ada 2005 constructions:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} Person;
 
 {{Ada/kw|package}} Programmer {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} Object {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}} Person.Object
                   {{Ada/kw|and}} Printable.Object
    {{Ada/kw|with}} 
       {{Ada/kw|record}}
          Skilled_In : Language_List;
       {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|record}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Programmer;

Another advantage of this coding convention is that we could use the &lt;tt&gt;-gnaty&lt;/tt&gt; option of GNAT to enforce these rules. The [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.3/gnat_ugn_unw/The-GNAT-Pretty_002dPrinter-gnatpp.html GNAT Pretty Printer] also helps to convert old code to that convention.
I propose to use 3 spaces for indentation (See [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.3/gnat_ugn_unw/Style-Checking.html Style Checking]), and it is a good idea to use a maximum line size because source code cannot be resized (on small screens this is a problem, and maybe someday it will be printed in a real book!). With the &lt;tt&gt;-gnaty&lt;/tt&gt; switch GNAT by default enforces a maximum line size of 79 characters, maybe reducing 10 characters is OK ( &lt;tt&gt;gcc -gnaty -gnatyM69&lt;/tt&gt;).

And making a bot (in Ada, of course :-) that watchs for miscompiled examples (syntax only: &lt;tt&gt;-gnats&lt;/tt&gt;) or code that do not follows the style guide of the book would be superb.

Well, In my opinion it is important to reach an agreement in this topic, so every one that contributes to this book should express his/her opinion! Thank you!

-- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 17:12, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: I think that having a common style accross the book is desirable but don't have a preference. About keywords I think it is better to use a template rather than directly linking to the keyword page and putting it in bold. See the Spanish wikibook implementation at [[es:Template:Ada/Reservada]]. This way not only the text around keywords is reduced but also we can change the face style and link later on. Other question is whether linking to a different page for every keyword or a single page with a section for each keyword (thus linking with #keyword). The second choice has the advantage that all the links will be blue from the beggining. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 21:37, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Great idea! I was looking for the wikicode equivalent to CSS, to use not only for keywords but also for strings and numeric constants. Templates could be the answer. I've created [[Template:Adakw]] for the keywords. I prefer to link every keyword with its own page, but it's true that all those red links are ugly. One possibility is reference the keywords to [[Programming:Ada:Keywords]] now, and in the future change the Template to link to its own page (except the table [[Template:Ada/Keywords]], that allways must link to its own page). -- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 10:59, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Well GNAT Pretty Printer would be good - however is't only available to GNATPro users as AdaCore has not release the sources yet. And it would only work on &quot;working demos&quot; - But then - &quot;working demos&quot; are prefered anyway (I keep them as SourceForge). An automated converter could be put together with AdaCL's Text-Filter-Lib without problem. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 10:10, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: I have never heard about that lib. If gnatpp only works with complete examples is a real problem, because few snippets will work. Nowadays the book has few source code, so we could even make every change without a bot, but in the future it will not be so easy. At [[w:Wikipedia:Bots]] are listed the requirements, I suppose that our bot could meet all. -- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 11:06, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I was wrong, the rule that splits a line before an operator comes from the GNU coding conventions [http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Formatting.html], and not from the [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat-style/ GNAT Coding Style Manual] (in the source code of GNAT the operator is left at the end of the line). I prefer the GNU style (although it is for C :-) because in my opion it's more readable. But the RM uses the other convention, so I think we should use that one. Maybe we could make a section for coding conventions explaining other common ones too (for example, the one that puts the {{Ada/kw|is}} keyword at a new line, like in [[w:SPARK programming language|SPARK]]). -- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 20:44, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Observe: is simply experiencing with awareness your feelings, your thoughts, and sensations directly without the use of words.  

The ability to observe yourself requires an ability to step back from yourself.  This process of stepping back, also called Teflon Mind, is a way to re-orient to the present moment.  Teflon mind is based on the idea of the non-stick cooking surface to which food does not stick.  Teflon Mind allows you to not get stuck.  

Preoccupation, rumination, and distraction are some of the ways people get stuck.  Observe is important because it helps you become like a blank slate upon which you can write.

There has been some discussion about the Logo being a bit old. Now I have received some alternatives which I would put to discussion:

* http://www.niestu.com/wiki-logo/military-1.jpg
* http://www.niestu.com/wiki-logo/civilian-1.jpg

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 19:12, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:What license would have these images? They should be GFDL or under the public domain. They are nice, although they do not scale very well: when zoom out they will look a bit confusing. It would be good to have the source composite images for future enhancements, or for translation into other languages (You guessed, I'm thinking about the Spanish wikibook). [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:41, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

::I created the montages, and gladly put my own work in the public domain.  However, the source images were downloaded randomly from the net, and many of them are no doubt copyright by their respective owners.  The law on such &quot;sampling&quot; seems rather vague, though I would not recommend commercial use of the images.  I welcome contributions of freely-usable versions of the objects, and would be happy to re-create the montages using them.  I made the images the same size as the banner image on the C++ wiki page, which Martin pointed me to when we originally discussed them.  I do have the original GIMP *.xcf files, if you'd like to substitute parts, like the text.  --Caracal

:::Great job! I prefer the civilian one: IMHO the montage is better and it is also politically correct. But, don't you think the vehicles are very small? --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 20:23, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I have always liked these two &quot;classic&quot; logos, specially the second:
* http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~dirk/.image/adalogo-new.gif [http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~dirk/ada-belgium/pictures.html]
* http://sigada.org/logos/
I don't know whether they can be freely used, but if there are more people that want any of these images as the new logo we could write the authors. --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 20:09, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:I like them too, although I would slightly prefer a logo specific for the wikibook. Some variation on that theme would be good. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 21:57, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Some variation of what logo? Of the second one (SIGAda Ada Letters' logo [http://sigada.org/logos/])? I suppose we have to request permission to make any change to any of those two logos. --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 08:59, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:::I meant a variation on the '''theme''' common to those logos, i.e. to create a new logo from scratch but using the same concept, a ship orbiting around a globe. You don't need permission to do that. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:57, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Although Ada is very well known for being used in embedded systems and education, I think is also used in very large and complex applications for workstations. And in my opinion we're agree that Ada can (and should) be used in far more applications, like desktop applications (anyway is a true multipurpose language). Maybe the logo should show those areas to promote it. And Caracal, I'm sorry: to talk is cheap, but I don't known what to add to one of your logos to reflect this change :-) --[[User:Suruena|suruena]] 08:54, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Wikimedia Commons would be a good source of images for a totally GFDL or public domain composition. Check for example http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Technology [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:11, 7 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I myself like the current image better than proposed one, but thats only my opinion.
If you find first image to be acceptable, I will try and find larger image. Just post here, as I'm new to this wiki stuff ;-) Both are surely public domain, as they are from first part of 19th century. About logos, well IMHO these two military-1.jpg and civilian-1.jpg actually portray only one use of Ada - embedded system development.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nonjudgmentally and Cognitive Therapy

•	See, but don’t evaluate.  Take a nonjudgmental stance.   Just the facts.  Focus on the “what,” not the “good” or “bad,” the “terrible” or “wonderful,” the “should” or “should not.”  

•	Unglue your opinions from the facts, from the “who, what, when, and where.”

•	Accept each moment, each event as a blanket spread out on the lawn accepts both the rain and the sun, each leaf that falls upon it.  

•	Acknowledge the helpful, the wholesome, but don’t judge it.  Acknowledge the harmful, the unwholesome, but don’t judge it.  

•	When you find yourself judging, don’t judge your judging.  
Linehan, pg.113

:&quot;Men are disturbed not by things that happen but by their opinions of the things that happen.&quot; Epictetus, A.D. 55-135

The ancient wisdom of Epictetus anticipated cognitive therapy by about 2000 years.  Epictetus suggests you are disturbed by your judgments about things, not the things themselves.  He suggests that the way we think about things affects how we feel about them.  Likewise, cognitive therapy and the skill non-judgmentally suggest alternative ways to think about things to change your mood. 
There are three fundamentals of cognitive therapy.  

•	First, the viewpoint you “choose” is vital to your mood.  If you can “choose” the way you view things you can change your mind.  

•	Second, mood and thought are linked.  If you change one you change the other. 

•	Third, the methods of cognitive therapy work on your thoughts and beliefs to change your mood.  The challenge of cognitive therapy: “Is there another way to see things?”

	Feelings and thoughts are so well blended that we rarely think that the association matters.  It does.  Feelings influence how you think, and thoughts affect how you feel. 

To illustrate how thoughts generate feelings consider:

•	If you opine that someone is disrespecting you, angry feelings arise.  

•	If you judge yourself a failure, sadness or disappointment follow.  

•	Comparing yourself to people which are richer, prettier, or smarter prompt feelings of envy.  

•	Gratitude follows thoughts about those who are less fortunate, hungry, or homeless.  

'''All-or-Nothing Thinking'''. 

All-or-nothing thinking distorts your worldview into polarized extremes.  Some polarities are quite familiar: good &amp; bad, right &amp; wrong, black &amp; white, beautiful &amp; ugly, should &amp; should not, in &amp; out, either-or, win &amp; lose, life or death, off &amp; on, and on and on.  This sort of splitting the world encourages idealization on one side and devaluation on the other.  The problem with split thinking is that reality is not polarized.  Reality is a unified whole with all the parts inter-related.  You cannot appreciate the unity of reality if you have a fixed (polarized) perspective because it prejudices your point of view.  

A big red nose…  You might believe that a small fault makes it impossible for a person to be “good” inside.  Such a rigid style of thinking limits your ability to engage ideas of future change and growth.  Polarized thinking tends to magnify errors and decrease your ability to adjust to circumstances.  All-or-nothing thinking is exacerbated when you are in emotion mind.

	When you are under the influence of emotion mind, you may feel there is only one way to think about a situation.  If depressed, you feel as if there are no options – it’s hopeless.  If angry, you are RIGHT and he is WRONG.  If anxious, it is safe in here and dangerous out there.  There is always more than one way of thinking about things.  In reasonable mind, you can explore some of these options.  Wise Mind integrates the emotional problems with reasonable solutions.  

'''Labeling'''.  

Good &amp; bad, terrible &amp; wonderful, and right &amp; wrong are just opinions.  You may feel there is no other way to think about things, but your belief may be a trap.  Once you label something, your mind is trapped by that identification. Consider Bad Mountain, how is it “bad”?
When you judge, you label (or evaluate) something as one way or another.  Judging is an opinion or belief.  Practicing taking a non-judgmental stance helps you escape the trap of your judgments.  
Labeling is not a problem with a rotten tomato, it will always be bad.  But things once defined, tend to remain fixed in the mind (the importance of first impressions).  For example, labeling someone sloppy may quickly lead to dismissing this person entirely.  

How would you label losing your job?  Emotion Mind would come up with words like “unfair”, “bad”, and “disastrous.” Reasonable Mind might be able to describe the lost job as a crisis and an opportunity.  

In Wise Mind, a job loss is stressful, a challenge to start something new, and a chance to re-evaluate your career.  Thus, the loss is more bearable.  You will gain a better perspective of your situation when you step back, observe &amp; describe the experience, gather more facts, and let go of your opinions. Seeing a job loss as an opportunity is an example of flexibility of thinking.  Your mood will change as you notice the alternatives and shift your perspective.  When difficulties arise, you will have more options if you can spend more time with the questions words (who, what, when, where) and less time with an emotion-based point of view.  

'''Mental Filtering'''. 

Mental filtering screens out facts or opinions that don’t fit with your current belief.  Do you see a part or the whole?  Strive to be like the blanket spread on the lawn – there is no filter, it accepts the rain and the sun.  Look at the big picture.

'''Over-generalization'''. 

The basis of this cognitive distortion is that you take an isolated case and apply it to all others.  Rather than looking at each case individually, you make decisions based upon your feelings.  “I never say the right thing.”  “We always do things your way.”  As you become more self-aware you will notice the words “always” and “never” as a signal to step back and look for the facts.  

'''Discounting the Positive'''.

This cognitive distortion rejects affirmations, positives, and compliments as if they didn’t count.  Too often people fall into the habit of disqualifying the positive comments directed toward them.  Accept compliments graciously.  When somebody says something nice to you say “thank you.”  

'''Jumping to Conclusions or Mind Reading'''. 

You may believe you know what a person is thinking.  You don’t.  Jumping to conclusions comes from faulty, incomplete, or distorted assumptions about others.  If a friend is late or forgets to call you, she could be tied up in traffic or she may be stuck in an urgent situation, why jump to the conclusion she is commenting on your worth as a person?  If you see the world through your insecurities, then your insecurities distort incoming information.  
Remember the adage about what happens when you assume!  U could make an ass out of u and me.

'''Magnification'''. 

Take a difficult event.  Now, exaggerate the importance of this event and make the meaning of it momentous.  “This is terrible, it means I’m ruined, I’ll never be able to recover.”  This magnification makes a bad situation worse.  Oppose emotional magnification with reasonable assessment.  From a detached point of view you can ask, “How important is this really?”  Will I remember it in 3 years, 3 months, 3 days, or even 3 hours?

	The problem with magnification is that intense thoughts generate equally intense emotions.  Focusing on the facts without evaluation or judging will have a calming effect, improve your mood and help you choose the wisest course of action. 
'''
Emotional Reasoning'''. 

•	I don’t like this; therefore it is bad.  

•	I like him; therefore he is a good guy.  

•	I’m scared about this test; therefore I will flunk.  

When emotions rule, feelings are mistaken for facts.  “Emotion mind” takes over.  Emotional reasoning makes stress worse, depression deeper, anxiety higher, and anger hotter.  The antidote is an activated Wise Mind which clarifies what the situation is and considers from where the emotions are coming.  When you say you can’t stand it, do you really mean you don’t like it?  Ask yourself, “Am I over-reacting and making this situation worse?”  “Could I stand it a little bit longer?” 
“Should” and “Shouldn’t” Statements. 

Albert Ellis dubbed the unrealistic use of “shoulds” musterbation.  Such as: 

•	People should not be rude.  

•	Drivers should not cut you off in traffic.  

•	Life should be fair.  

Other words that put unnecessary pressure on you are “must”, “ought”, and “have to.”  

Reality is as it is and as it should be.  Reality follows the laws of the universe as it should. An opinion that reality should be different than it IS is not reality-based.  Try to be a blanket and accept reality as it is.  

Some “shoulds” are really a demand in disguise.  If you rigidly hold to unrealistic expectations, you will often be angered because people will not behave the way you feel they must.  Your ability to be flexible and accept is healthy.  Change unrealistic demands to healthy preferences.  

A thought, “he should help me” is really a demand, “I want you to help me”.  The belief he should help me prompts feelings of anger.  The demand I want you to help me is more respectful.  

'''Conclusion'''

	The goal of non-judgmentally is to see things from non-polarized perspectives.  Flexibility of thinking is characterized by the ability to entertain other points of view.  Consider too how you would think about something if you were feeling better.  Strive to be factual and unglue your opinions from the facts, you could try to see things from some else’s point of view.  Instead of polarized extremes, activate your Wise Mind to find balance, unity, and acceptance.  

	Reality does not come labeled, magnified, polarized, filtered, or discounted.  You distort reality in those ways.  Embrace reality by stepping back a bit and non-judgmentally looking at the bigger picture.  

	Who, what, when, and where questions reveal facts which are not as disturbing as opinions.  Assumptions, like opinions, close the mind to facts.  An open mind allows for possibilities, options and surprises. 
Too often, people tend to judge themselves and others in either excessively positive terms (idealization or “what I like”) or excessively negative terms (devaluation or “what I don’t like”).  The goal is not to be more balanced in your judgments, but rather to drop judging in most situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Describe is putting words on experience and experience into words.

Describe: the ability to put verbal labels to (internal and external) events is essential for self-control.  

Putting words on one’s experience is the first step toward taking control of your mind.  Describing is thinking with words and includes your internal dialogue as well as verbal and written expression.  This sort of talking to yourself helps you become focused.  It is a way to overcome distractions because you learn to redirect your thinking to your here-and-now experience.  As you practice describe, you will become clearer about what you are doing and what you want to do.  

Time spent describing is an investment.  Make consistent use of a journal, to-do list, calendar and organizer.

'''Summary'''
:   
:   
:''•	Do one thing at a time.  When you are eating, eat.  When you are walking, walk.  When you are bathing, bathe.  When you are working, work.  When you are in a group, or a conversation, focus your attention on the very moment you are in with the other person.  When you are thinking, think.  When you are worrying, worry.   When you are planning, plan.  When you are remembering, remember.  Do each thing with all of your attention.   
:
:   
:•''	If other actions, or other thoughts, or strong feelings distract you, let go of distractions and go back to what you are doing – again, and again, and again.''   
:
:   
:•	''Concentrate your mind.  If you find you are doing two things at once, stop and go back to one thing at a time.''  
 &lt;br /&gt;

	One-mindfully is sustained attention on the present moment which develops concentration.  This skill is easier when you are interested in something and much harder when you are not.  When you are doing something that you totally love, focusing on it whole-heartedly is easy.  Intense total involvement follows from passionate interest.  But how do you focus your mind when the activity is not as compelling as your favorite thing to do?  

	This paper seeks to explain the mindfulness skill one-mindfully in conjunction with the other DBT skills of emotional regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance, and the core mindfulness skills.  One-mindfully is one of the “How” to take hold of your mind skills, along with non-judgmentally and effectively.  The other mindfulness skills describe “What” to do to take hold of you your mind and include observe, describe, and participate.  I have adopted the format of expanding Linehan’s instructions regarding one-mindfully with my explanations one-by-one.

'''Do one thing at a time.'''  

:	The essence of mindfulness is acting with undivided attention.   One-mindfully is the discipline of doing one thing at a time with awareness. One-mindfully is the opposite of how most people operate.  Most of us think that if we do several things at once, we will accomplish more, but in the behavior laboratory those instructed to do one thing at a time actually accomplished more than those instructed to multi-task.  
:
:There are several advantages to doing one thing at a time besides increased productivity.  When thoughts are racing, concentrating on one thing slows the mind.  Doing one thing at a time decreases anxiety by focusing the mind on one thing, pushing from one’s mind preoccupations and worries.   
:
:Like a guard at the palace gate who is alert to everything that happens you must be aware of every thought, emotion, and distraction.  Such mindful watching brings your attention back to the present moment.  Doing one thing at a time is like driving a car and takes constant adjustments regarding the road and traffic.  But instead of a steering wheel and gas pedal, to stay in the present moment use the skills observe (just noticing the experience) and describe (putting words on the experience and the experience in words).  Using words this way makes you aware of what you are doing.  
:
'''When you are eating, eat.'''  

:It is not unusual to mindlessly eat while watching TV, reading the paper, or walking around.  Eating mindfully is very different experience than the way you normally eat.  Mindfully eating concentrates on the eating experience.  Only in the present moment do you experience the sensations of eating.  When you are present you can taste, feel, and smell the fleeting sensations of your food.  Mindful eating entails the effort to taste flavors, smell scents, and feel textures.  Slow down to observe and describe the experience of eating.  You are more likely to notice when you are feeling full when eating this way.  If you pay attention to the sensation of satiety, you will probably stop eating sooner.  Eating with sustained attention on the present moment helps you learn self-control and self-discipline.  

'''When you are walking, walk.'''

:Walking, too, can be a way to take hold of your mind.  This is mentioned in the describe section, “…say in your mind… walking, step, step, step…” Describing walking this way increases awareness of your self and environment.  Your mind will slow as you focus on your movement.  

'''When you are bathing, bathe.'''

:Some people have a routine they go through every time they shower that allows them to concentrate on their actions mindfully.  Bathing offers many opportunities of self-soothing.  Bathing with sustained attention is peaceful and calming.  Those moments of the day when you are bathing may help you cope with stress, relieve anxiety, and cultivate mindfulness.   
 &lt;br /&gt;
:Notice how water appears, feels, and sounds.  Notice the smell of soap and shampoo.  Notice the difference between wet and dry, hot and cold.  Notice the transitions between turning on the water, getting in the water, wetting hair, shampooing, soaping, turning off the water, and drying.  You will have the opportunity to repeat your observations daily.  

'''When you are working, work.'''

:Work offers many opportunities for doing one thing at a time and overcome distractions.  You may be surprised at how much you can be done if you set your mind to it.  Such a commitment to work helps you learn mastery, the feeling of being competent and in control.  
:&lt;br /&gt;

:Many people have told me that they do not have the same sorts of problems at work that they do at home.  They admit that they are not willing to work for themselves as they are for others.  Are you 
:willing to work for what you want?
:&lt;br /&gt;

:What is your life’s work?  How does your work express you and your place in the world?  What attitude do you bring to the work you do?  What part of your work is play and what part of play is work?  
:&lt;br /&gt;

:When you are in a group, or a conversation, focus your attention on the very moment you are in with the other person.
:&lt;br /&gt;

:Skills class is an opportunity to practice one-mindfully  by devoting your full attention to learning skills.  
:&lt;br /&gt;

:In conversation, your ability to be interpersonally effective increases by practicing one-mindfully.  No matter how nervous you are with another person, focusing your attention on the very moment you are in liberates you from troubling emotions such as doubt, worry, stress, and fear.  Letting go of troubling emotions sounds easy but is so hard.  But focusing with complete involvement leaves no room in consciousness for distractions like troubling emotions.  
:
'''When you are thinking, think.'''

:Thinking this way is hard work!  To think one-mindfully, try practicing the “How” skills observe, describe and participate with your thoughts in your mind.  Observe is useful because you must be aware of where your attention is at all times.  Observe is your mind’s eye, the witness to the fragile products of your thinking, your ideas.  Describe is putting words on thoughts and your thoughts into words.  When you enter into the experience of thinking completely, forgetting yourself, you are participating.  Think without the distraction of judging.  Effective thinking is flexible, intuitive and includes multiple perspectives.  An inquisitive and open-minded attitude helps you see yourself and others from fresh perspectives.  
:
'''When you are worrying, worry. '''

:An effective therapy for worry:  set aside 30 minutes a day to worry.  Go to the same place each day and try to spend the whole 30 minutes worrying.  During the rest of the day, banish worries from your mind, reminding yourself that you will attend to that particular worry during your worry time.  If you practice worrying one-mindfully, during the rest of the day, you will let go of your worries and free your mind to do something else. 
 
'''When you are planning, plan.'''

:The essence of planning is setting goals.  A workable goal is specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic, and time-conscious.  Your intention to make the future a certain way is an appropriate here-and-now activity.  Make plans for a life worth living.  Use a calendar and a list of things to do to schedule small steps to a future you want.  

'''When you are remembering, remember.'''

:A note about memory: there are voluntary and involuntary memories.  Voluntary memories are the memories you choose to have and involuntary memories come unbidden.  
:&lt;br /&gt;

:When you are remembering, you are not playing back a tape of the event – you are attending to the present moment mentally retrieving the past.  Voluntary memory is a mental event grounded in your historical experience.  There is an act of will in each memory.  One could say that memory is conjuring the past, i.e., evoking or calling forth as if by magic.  Note that memory takes effort, and if you want to remember something, you need to spend time remembering as many of the connected events as possible.  
:&lt;br /&gt;

:Involuntary memories are intrusive, come unbidden, and can be quite distracting.  One way to reduce the effect of intrusive memories of the past is to use the mindfulness techniques outlined here.  It may seem backwards, but the Wise Mind way to deal with intrusive memories is to observe and describe them non-judgmentally (without an opinion about it).  Avoid avoiding memories.  Attend to your memory by attending to the present memory – non-judgmentally observe and describe it, and participate with it, if you can.  Accepting your memory is not approving of its’ content.  Notice it and then effectively go back to what you are doing.  When you are not remembering, focus on the present moment.

'''Do each thing with all of your attention.'''

:Sustained mental attention or concentration is a powerful tool to bring to your daily activities.  Doing each thing with all your attention will assist you doing what is needed in each situation.  Connecting yourself to your activities with attention is a simple idea, but the benefit of doing one thing with all your attention is enormous.    
:  
:If other actions, or other thoughts, or strong feelings distract you, let go of distractions and go back to what you are doing – again, and again, and again.  The effort of doing each thing with sustained mental attention requires a commitment.   At first, you may only be able to focus your attention for a second.  But try, try again.    
&lt;br /&gt;

:For many the problem is letting go of distractions.  Letting go of distractions (especially memories) may feel like abandonment.  Abandonment is a scary word for many, because they have been hurt so many times.  Letting go of certain memories may feel like abandonment.  You are leaving your old self (painful memories) and creating a new self.    
:  &lt;br /&gt;

:Awareness of your attention gives you the opportunity to direct it to one thing or another.  Distractions will come from all directions.  Let distractions go and turn your mind toward what you are doing.  Returning to what you are doing is powerful.    
:A deceptively simple strategy when you find your thoughts wandering astray is to say to yourself, “Be here now” and turn your mind toward what you are doing.  

'''Concentrate your mind.'''  

:Concentration is the gathering of the mind, bringing all the parts together, uniting the mental faculties.  Attention is focusing on a selected object.  Intuition, desire, and curiosity naturally concentrate your mind.  Concentration is one of the qualities of Wise Mind.If you find you are doing two things at once, stop and go back to one thing at a time.  
:&lt;br /&gt;

:Focusing on one thing in the moment does not mean that one cannot do complex tasks requiring many simultaneous activities.  Like the dancer on the dance floor, at one with the music and her partner, attend completely to what you are doing.  Dancing integrates many processes – listening, moving, looking, and balance, but you are still doing only one thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wise Mind is the integration of emotion mind and reasonable mind.  Emotion mind is characterized by mood dependent behavior, i.e. behavior that is determined by the current emotional state.  Emotion mind is problematic because people often act impulsively under the effect of strong emotions.  Reasonable mind, in contrast to emotion mind, is cool and deliberate.  Reasonable mind is the product of learning, experience, and knowledge.  Wise mind is the integration of emotion mind and reasonable mind but goes beyond both of them.

Wise Mind is a state of mind in which you experience yourself as being calm, centered, and in control of your emotions.  

In Wise Mind, you act in accordance with your beliefs, principles, and values which deepens feelings of coherence and integrity.  

Wise Mind is strengthened by practicing all skills, especially [[Dialectical Behavioral Therapy/Core Mindfulness Skills|Core Mindfulness Skills]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Marsha Linehan says, “participating is the ultimate goal.” Participating is one form of optimal or “peak” experience. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (Chick-sent-me-high) is a psychologist who has made it his life’s work to describe the optimal experience, flow. Csikszentmihalyi says, “Flow denotes the wholistic sensation when we act with total involvement.” Compare this to Linehan’s description of participate, “Participation is entering wholly into an activity, becoming one with an activity. It is throwing yourself into something. It is spontaneous behavior to a certain extent, although you can also do it mindfully.” I have taken Linehan’s descriptions of participate (italicized and bolded) and integrated them with Csikszentmihalyi’s descriptions of flow. Enter into your experiences.

'''Imagine entering into your experiences through a door. When you step through the door, you enter a world of participate and flow. In this world, your reality changes from fragmented and disconnected to whole and connected. Your thoughts and feelings combine to form Wise Mind. In this world, you cope with whatever comes along with confidence. You do the best you can and that is good enough. Your goals are clear, but reaching the goal is not as important as the steps you take along the way.''' Time disappears once you step through this door in this place and the only thing that matters is NOW. ''In this world of total involvement'', you completely forget yourself, your problems, and the time. ''Your concentration deepens and you are completely involved with what you are doing''. Although you may experience serenity, or even joy, you are not aware of these feelings at the time. Often people describe their experience of flow as satisfying, gratifying, rewarding or stimulating. Flow recharges your batteries. Let yourself get involved in the moment, let go of ruminating.

The present is what matters. The gateway to flow is focusing your attention to the NOW. Ruminating is part of that running commentary from which you are trying to free yourself. Worries, problems, preoccupations, and other nagging issues separate you from being involved in the present moment. '''Rumination, the distracting dialogue of preoccupation, splits your awareness from your actions. Distraction detracts from flow. Concentrating on the moment pushes away distractions. Use your interest, curiosity, and intuition to turn your mind back to your endeavor.''' Let your curiosity and intuitions guide you back to your undertaking. Throwing yourself into the task engages you in the moment. “Willingness” is spontaneously doing just what is needed in a situation. In your Wise Mind you have to believe what is needed is doable (it is). You can deal with any situation. The proof? You have so far. Become one with your experience, completely forgetting yourself.

Have you ever been so immersed in an activity that you have forgotten the time, where you were, past problems, and future worries? Forgot yourself? Perhaps, you were puttering around the house, working in the garden, or reading a thriller. Some forget themselves and their surroundings while playing the piano, painting, or some other hobby. These activities generate flow because the effort seems easy and playful. Concentrating on these tasks seems natural almost effortless. Doing your taxes or your first day on a job are not going to result in flow. ''An easy, playful activity has more self-forgetting potential because your attention is focused completely on the activity. The closer you get to flow, the more you concentrate and focus your attention. It is much easier to become one with your experience when the task is doable (like chores, grooming, playing games, crafts, or routine activities). By focusing all your attention on your ordinary daily activities you can practice participate (and flow).''

&lt;nowiki&gt;With observe &amp; describe you are aware of your awareness (noticing and putting words on your experience). In flow, you are aware of your actions but not aware of your awareness. Your attention is undivided. When you become one with your experience, you are aware of your experience (actions) but not aware of your awareness (forgetting yourself). Control is no problem because the activity feels so intuitive and natural. This strong sense of control pushes out thoughts not directly related to your experience. Your focus is on your actions. Worries don’t matter. Happiness is forgetting yourself. Act intuitively from Wise Mind.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The five words of this heading just about sum up DBT. Remember, Wise Mind is the integration of what you think and what you feel. Intuition goes beyond your thoughts and feelings to what you know. Such intuitive knowing is an expression of your inner wisdom or Wise Mind. You practice expressing Wise Mind when you skillfully meet your problems and challenges. To be wise you have to practice being wise. ''Surprisingly, flow is more likely to happen during tasks that stretch your mental and physical capabilities than during relaxation, entertainment, or leisure. More people get flow from their jobs than from their free time activities. The ideal job for creating flow would have a challenge requiring skills, clear goals, a chance of completion, the opportunity to concentrate, and immediate feedback''. Even mundane activities allow you to merge your actions and awareness – driving, reading, dressing, grooming, talking or walking. When performed whole-heartedly, the mundane (and free-time activities) can become the time-stopping activities of flow. You ignore distractions by engaging your intuition and curiosity. Intuition leads you past distractions by focusing on doing the next right thing. Curiosity and flow often go together. When you are in the flow of curiosity, you have the desire to know, a lust for learning, and a thirst for knowledge. Curiosity is a powerful motivation for flow.

Do just what is needed in each situation – a skillful dancer on the dance floor, one with the music and your partner, neither willful or sitting on your hands.

The skillful dancer has centered her attention on the music and her partner. She is focused on doing just what she needs to do. Her problems and preoccupations are excluded from awareness. Past and future aren’t relevant to the moment by moment actions and adjustments needed to skillfully dance. Dancing with flow is a reward by itself. What activities have you mastered that offer you opportunities for flow? Start with your present abilities and strengths to develop your skills to participate and flow. “Willfulness” is sitting on your hands when you need action. Giving up (refusing to make needed changes) and refusing to tolerate the moment (refusing to accept the unchangeable) are examples of willfulness. The dancer accepts the music and her partner and willingly makes changes.

Actively practice your skills as you learn them, until they become part of you, and you use them without self-consciousness.

Learning skills takes practice, practice, practice. You are going to have to make an effort to study, learn, and practice them. The secret to learning skills is applying skills to appropriate challenges. Apathy, anxiety, and boredom are great challenges to practice skills.

If you are apathetic, do not care, or generally lack enthusiasm - find a challenge or engage your skills. Get active. Make it a game. Set a goal. If boredom is the problem, increase the challenge. '''Do something, ''anything'' to make better use of your skills.''' Basically, put some stress on yourself like setting a deadline. If you are anxious, decrease the challenge by taking some of the pressure off and increase your skills by engaging your curiosity, being mindful to your emotions, or practicing acceptance. Linehan’s final advice on participate is Radical Acceptance.

Borderline and suicidal individuals are emotionally intense and labile – frequently angry, intensely frustrated, depressed, and anxious. This suggests that borderline clients might benefit from help in learning to regulate their emotions. Dialectical behavior therapy skills for emotion regulation include:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Function of Emotions''' 

Understanding the function of emotions and help you understand why you do what you do.  Intense emotions communicate to others and motivate behavior. By understanding the function of emotions, you can better understand why you do what you do.  

'''Emotions communicate to (and influence) others''' 

Facial expressions are a “hard-wired” part of emotions, i.e. you are born with them.  Both the expression of emotion and the understanding of emotion are part of our biological makeup.  In primitive societies and among animals, facial expressions communicate messages without words.  Research shows that in all cultures, the same facial expressions are linked to the same basic emotions. Some examples of what is communicated include smiles (happiness), frowns (sadness), scowls (anger), wide-eyed &amp; open-mouthed (surprise), wrinkled nose (disgust), dimpled cheek &amp; eye-roll (contempt), and wide-eyed &amp; thin-lipped (fear). Facial expressions communicate these emotions faster than words.

Both verbal and nonverbal forms of emotional expressions have an automatic effect on others. For example, an infant reacts spontaneously to an adult’s smile or look of fright. This automatic reaction serves infants well as it helps them understand communications from their caregivers intuitively. 

When physical expressions of emotion (facial expressions, movement, gesture, touch, posture, voice tone) and what a person says don’t go together, most people will trust the nonverbal expressions over the verbal ones. You are more likely to be fully understood if you make your verbal message congruent with your nonverbal message.  If your nonverbal emotional expressions are not accurate indicators of what you are experiencing, then your emotions will be misread and your message will be misunderstood. The mismatch of verbal and nonverbal communications can lead to confusion and ineffectual communication. 

Many people learn to inhibit or hide their expression of emotions, at least some of the time. One problem of hiding emotions is that other people do not know how upset a person is, if she doesn’t let somebody see how she feels. 
When it is important to communicate to others, or send them a clear message, it can be very hard to change emotions. 

* If Jane thinks Kathy is in the wrong and wants her to know it, Jane may try to communicate her anger nonverbally.  Jane may frown, scowl, and pout or remain angry until Kathy gets the message. (The alternative here is that Jane would explain her displeasure to Kathy using verbal and nonverbal means, and then go back to normal). 
The communication of emotions influences others, whether a person intends it or not. 

* If you meet someone who is warm and friendly and have a favorable first impression, you are more likely to do a favor for them later and feel good about doing it. 

* A supervisor expressing disappointment to an employee may cause the employee to work harder to win her approval. 

* If a person complains about a problem, people are less likely to ignore it. 

* Expressing worthlessness, hopelessness, and agonizing sadness may influence a therapist, or another person, to take away the pain. (So the hope goes). 

* Expressed anger may stop another’s behavior. 

It can be extremely helpful to consciously study how people express emotions through words, facial expressions, tone of voice, and so on. Doing so leads you to see all the subtle cues people pass back and forth as they bid and respond to one another’s bids. A bid is a fundamental unit of emotional communication – a greeting, question, gesture or any expression that connects you to another person. A response to a bid is an answer to somebody’s request for emotional connection, usually positive (receptive) or negative (indifference). With awareness of how bids communicate, you can ensure that the messages you send via body language match the messages you send with your spoken language. 

Research has shown that feeling and acting positive has benefits beyond just feeling pleasant. Positive emotions actually make it easier for you to have a better life. More positive emotions lead to building friendships, love, better physical health and greater achievement. When we are in a positive mood, people like us better, friendship and cooperation are easier. Falling in love and feeling love are quite positive moods. Positive feelings signal win-win encounters, as in being in love, making a friend, and the benefits of exercise. Under the effects of positive mood we are more creative. We are open to new ideas when we’re happy. We are more likely to have new experiences when we are feeling upbeat and optimistic. 

'''Emotions organize and prepare a person to act''' 

Behavior that is necessary for survival is often motivated by strong emotions, therefore quite efficient.  Survival behavior in animals includes the fight or flight response, an automatic response which prepares them to instantly react to save yourself from danger.  

Anger → Fight 
Fear → Flight or Freeze

When every moment counts for survival, an automatically generated emotion-based behavior will take over by controlling the animal so thinking is unnecessary. The emotional response is immediate and instinctual. The action urge connected to specific emotions is hard-wired. 

* Fear motivates the animal to run away from a dangerous or predatory situation. 

* If there was no sadness at losing people, why go out and look for lost people or try to save people who are dying? Communities would die off if there were no sadness. 

* Students’ desire to reduce test anxiety motivates intense studying.  

* Some people are afraid to reduce guilt, because they are afraid that without guilt, they will start doing harmful things. 

* Anger is a very scary emotion: many people fear losing control if they act on their anger.  

Feeling angry can make you feel like you are going to explode, strike, throw something or blow up. When you feel angry, you may feel like doing something painful to others. Behaviors like shouting, clenching fists, making aggressive gestures, slamming doors when storming away, or throwing things suggest violence. Therefore, it is not surprising that you feel uncomfortable when you feel angry. 

'''Emotions function to communicate to ourselves: Emotions can be “self-validating”''' 

Emotions are reactions to external or internal events or interpretations of events.  These emotional reactions are like a signal or alarm that something psychological is happening.  So emotions are a two-part process: the psychological part and the physical part.  The physical part of emotion is easier to understand because they feel a certain way, for example, anger feels hot and fear feels like running away.  The problem is the psychological part of an emotion, because it is often difficult to identify what about the situation set off an emotion.  Emotions happen automatically without thinking about the situation.  It is not unusual, to feel something and not know what set the emotion going.

People often ignore their unclear emotional responses to a situation simply because they can’t understand their psychological triggers.  Putting emotional responses into words is a way to understand them.  First, you have to observe the emotional experience or feel your feelings.  Next, you put your experience into words by describing the feelings and the action urge.  Finally, you make sense of what's going on with you putting the physical sensations with your psychological situation.  

Through experience, you learn when to trust your emotional responses as useful information about the situation. “Listen to your gut instinct” means you pay attention to your emotional reaction and use it as a guide for your behavior.  Likewise, when we say a person has a “good feel for the situation,” we are referring to the ability to use emotions as signals to guide behavior. 

Peer-pressure often discourages people to think about their feelings.  You may have been in a situation in which you didn't feel right about doing something but others told you to disregard your feelings (or wise mind) and you were &quot;forced&quot; to do it anyway. 

As you know, intense emotions can interfere with an effective response to a situation. For example, fear motivates you to avoid life-threatening danger, but when you fearfully avoid a difficult situation you may be creating more problems for yourself.  If you are able to examine your fear and see that it is not a life-or-death situation; you can overcome your avoidance.  Sometimes, just thinking, “what is the worst that could happen?” will help you overcome the fear and do what you need to do.  

When emotions are treated as if they were facts, reason serves the master of emotion. People often use their emotional reactions to other people and to events as information about the situation. Emotional reactions often determine your thoughts about the situation. A type of mood dependent behavior is mood dependent thinking, i.e. thinking that is determined by your mood. If you use emotions as the only source of information for your thinking, emotions are treated as facts: “if I feel incompetent, I am.” “If I get depressed when left alone, I shouldn’t be left alone.” “If I feel right about something, it is right.” 

Mood dependent behavior is behavior determined by the current mood. For example, some people who feel depressed act depressed – they lie on the couch, isolate themselves, and don’t do things that they would enjoy. Then because they are acting in a way that is determined by depressed feelings they say to themselves, “I don't want to leave the house, I am going to stay on the couch and I don't care if the phone rings.  I'm depressed!” 

Another possible reaction to feelings of lethargy and isolation is to say to yourself, &quot;I have to call my friends and get out of here otherwise I'm going to get really depressed.&quot;

Most approaches to mental health treatment focus on changing distressing events and circumstances. They have paid little attention to accepting, finding meaning for, and tolerating distress. This task has generally been tackled by religious and spiritual communities and leaders. Dialectical behavior therapy emphasizes learning to bear pain skillfully.

Distress tolerance skills constitute a natural development from mindfulness skills. They have to do with the ability to accept, in a non-evaluative and nonjudgmental fashion, both oneself and the current situation. Although the stance advocated here is a nonjudgmental one, this does not mean that it is one of approval: acceptance of reality is not approval of reality.

Distress tolerance behaviors are concerned with tolerating and surviving crises and with accepting life as it is in the moment. 

Four sets of crisis survival strategies are taught:
* [[/Distracting/]]
* [[/Self-soothing/]]
* [[/Improving the moment/]]
* [[/Thinking of pros and cons/]]. 


[[/Acceptance/]] skills include:
* [[/Radical Acceptance/]]
* [[/Turning the mind/]] toward acceptance
* [[/Willingness/]] versus [[/Willfulness/]].

==anata-gata==
I once read about anata-gata which was translated as &quot;you (honorific)&quot;. Which one is more polite, anata-sama or anata-gata? Is anata-gata archaic? [[User:Agro1986|Agro1986]] 14:39, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

:Hi. Anata-gata(あなた方) is plural, whereas anata-sama(あなた様) is singular. And in fact anata-gata is not exactly honorific I guess. In [[Japanese:Grammar:Pronouns#Second person pronouns|this page]], it is labeled as &quot;formal&quot;, and I think it's appropriate. Anata-gata is not archaic. You can use it but as described in the article, calling by name is preferred (e.g. 鈴木さんたち). I feel anata-sama is a bit archaic or stagy. Rather, just anata is used maybe... Or, in business situation, okyaku-sama(お客様) or sochira-sama(そちら様) is used. [[Talk:Japanese:Grammar:Pronouns|Tomos also points out &quot;sensei&quot;]]. - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 03:56:07, 2005-09-01 (UTC)

== Kimi? ==

This article implies this is the typical casual second-person pronoun boys (using boku) use, but this isn't exactly the idea I've gotten from my experience. (Although I am not a very reliable source, having the dubious experience of about 40 total episodes of subtitled anime and a brief friendship with an exchange student.) The main usage I've seen is as (A) affectionate, often used towards a girlfriend/wife and (B) condescending, used to basically anyone you call -kun because they are lower than you. The du-jour pronoun that boys use among other boys appears to be omae (and this is the part I can verify from that exchange student). I can imagine the humorous misunderstandings now...

      <text xml:space="preserve">EFFECTIVELY USE SKILLS

A skill is an ability acquired by training.  As you learn and refine skills, you become more effective, i.e., you are able to maximize positive outcomes and minimize negative outcomes.  In familiar situations, you know how to maximize benefits because you know from experience what works.  But in unfamiliar or difficult situations, when you don't have the benefit of previous experience, you need skills to guide you to the best possible outcome.  This paper focuses on the core mindfulness skill &quot;Effectively,&quot; described by Marsha Linehan  which will help you learn and develop the necessary skills to deal with stressful situations:

Effectively

* Focus on what works.  Do what needs to be done in each situation.  Become a skillful dancer on the dance floor, one with the music and your partner, neither willful nor sitting on your hands.  
* Stay away from “fair” and “unfair,” “right” and “wrong,” “should” and “should not.” 
* Play by the rules.  Don’t “cut off your nose to spite your face.”
* Act as skillfully as you can, meeting the needs of the situation you are in.  Not the situation you wish you were in; not the one that is just; not the one that is more comfortable; not the one that… 
* Keep an eye on your objectives in the situation and do what is necessary to achieve them.  Let go of vengeance, useless anger, and righteousness. They hurt you and don’t work.

'''Focus on what works.
'''Skills work!  The major skills - core mindfulness, emotional regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance skills - will help you maximize your positive outcomes.  Instead of reacting automatically without thinking and without skills to a difficult situation, you can learn to practice the smaller, focused skills (like effectively) that make up the major skills (like core mindfulness).  The first step to acting skillfully is to focus on making choices, seeing opportunities, and examining options to practice skills.  You can choose to work with reality as it is in the here-and-now.  This approach is more effective than reacting without thinking.
Today's focus is on being effective.  Rather than emphasizing the end result, concentrate on conducting yourself effectively, which focuses on the most productive process, your choice to use skillful means.  “What works,” in this sense, is a focus on continually developing skills and connecting to reality.  

Most people do not effectively engage problems, they avoid them.  You will be more effective engaging problems if you employ skills.  Whether you use change skills (interpersonal effectiveness or emotion regulation) or acceptance skills (core mindfulness or distress tolerance) you will feel more competent and in control by approaching your problems skillfully.  
You can learn to be effective by engaging problems with your Wise Mind (drawing upon your inner wisdom).  In Wise Mind, you are able to serenely accept what you cannot change and courageously change the things you can.  

Do what needs to be done in each situation.
Willingness is doing just what is needed in each situation whether you feel like it or not.  Willingness accepts that loss, pain, and distress are part of life and cannot be entirely avoided or removed.  Willingness reduces the intensity of loss, pain, and distress because you redirect your attention to the present moment and the task at hand. 

Become a skillful dancer on the dance floor, one with the music and your partner, neither willful nor sitting on your hands.
Imagine you are a skillful dancer.  The dance floor is your life with all its opportunities and options.  Your partner is the here-and-now world in which you live.  The music is the feeling of flow when you participate willingly in the dance of life.  
Imagine, too, sitting at the edge of the dance floor like a wallflower avoiding the music and your partner.  Such “sitting on your hands” is called willfulness.  Willfulness is the opposite of willingness; it is being in-effective. Willfulness is NOT doing what is required of reality.  Willfulness is characterized by avoidance and giving up.  Willfulness is refusing to tolerate the moment and refusing to make changes that are needed

Stay away from “fair” and “unfair,” “right” and “wrong,” “should” and “should not.”
Reality just is - neither fair or unfair, right or wrong, good nor bad.  Reality doesn’t care what you think it should or should not be. Reality is what it is.  
Judgmental evaluation of reality locks you into rigid black-and-white thinking.  A more effective thinking style is flexible, intuitive, and adjustable. If you believe there is only one-way to do things, you are locked into the rut of polarized thinking (all-or-nothing thinking) and you will eventually get stuck.  
By seeing yourself and others realistically, you develop a balanced, inclusive, and open-minded approach. A nonjudgmental approach accepts reality as complex, complicated, and requiring multiple perspectives.  Such an open attitude allows you to see more solutions.
Accepting mistakes is like accepting problems, most people avoid them.  What works when it comes to mistakes?  Learning from mistakes works.  Most people get angry or disappointed with themselves for making a mistake. Instead, you will learn and grow as a person when you accept mistakes and choose to view mistakes as life's lessons. 

Play by the rules.  
Consider these “rules” or basic assumptions of Dialectical Behavior Therapy:  
First, you are doing the best you can (if you knew a better way, you would do it).  
Second, you want to improve.  
Third, you need to do better, try harder and be more motivated to change.
Fourth, you may not have caused all your problems, but you have to solve them anyway.  
Fifth, if you are suicidal, you must change your life, not end it.  
Sixth, you must learn new behaviors in all relevant contexts.  
Finally, you cannot fail in therapy. 

Don’t “cut off your nose to spite your face.”
In other words, don’t make the situation worse than it already is!  Acts of anger or revenge will hurt you more than it hurts anyone else because acting out of anger and vengeance is not skillful.

Act as skillfully as you can, meeting the needs of the situation you are in.  Not the situation you wish you were in; not the one that is just; not the one that is more comfortable; not the one that… 
Meeting the situation you are in may require you to dismiss your wishes, abandon your ideas of justice, and leave your comfort zone.  
* Wishing is a way to avoid.  Wishes indicate that you are trying to solve your problems by magic not by using skills.  
* Thoughts of injustice provoke anger and increase stress.  If the situation is not just, remember, life is not fair.  
* Comfort is temporary.  Tolerating discomfort is much easier if you learn distress tolerance skills.  

Keep an eye on your objectives in the situation and do what is necessary to achieve them.  
What sort of “eye” is this?  This eye mindfully “observes” your objective.  When you mindfully observe your objective other thoughts and feelings not related to your objective are ignored.  Ignore &quot;I don't feel like it&quot; and other self-defeating thoughts.  One way to “feel one way and act another” is to notice your feelings, but stay focused on your objective.  
Doing what is necessary to achieve your objectives requires mental flexibility.  If your objective is rigidly defined, you are locked into a fixed outcome.  
Here is an example from interpersonal effectiveness skills: Consider the important difference between the objective to have someone do a certain thing and the objective to communicate to another person, as best you can, what you would like them to do.  Your focus on skillfully communicating to another person what you want orients you to using your skills to control your behavior.  You cannot control the other person. Effectiveness changes the focus from outside (other’s actions or the outcome) to inside (awareness of the choices you are making).  
Let go of vengeance, useless anger, and righteousness. They hurt you and don’t work.
The opposite of effectively would be to make it worse than it already is. But when people are stressed the part of the brain that allows them to be mindful is turned off. Likewise, feelings of anger and vengeance cause people to react automatically not choose mindfully.  

Conclusion
	 Wisdom and skills help you effectively manage life’s difficult problems.  Engage problems and look at your options and choices.  Willingness is doing just what is needed in each situation connecting your Wise Mind to the task-at-hand.  Instead of being judgmental, use your curiosity to develop mental flexibility.  Think of the rules as the assumptions of DBT.  Do not make the situation worse than it already is.  Meet the situation you are in by focusing on what you can control.  Practice Radical Acceptance with your mistakes, this will help you learn and grow.

= Properties of Sentential Connectives =

Here we list some of the more famous, historically important, or otherwise useful equivalences and tautologies.  They can be added to the ones listed in [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility#Interdefinability of connectives|Interdefinability of connectives]].  We can go on at quite some length here, but will try to keep the list somewhat restrained.  Remember that for every equivalence of &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, there is a related tautology &lt;math&gt;\varphi \leftrightarrow \psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

== Bivalence ==

Every formula has exactly one of two truth values.

: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{P} \lor \lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Law of Excluded Middle''
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \lnot (\mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Law of Non-Contradiction''

== Analogues to arithmetic laws ==

Some familiar laws from arithmetic have analogues in sentential logic.

=== Reflexivity ===

Conditional and biconditional (but not conjunction and disjunction) are reflexive.

: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Commutativity ===

Conjunction, disjunction, and biconditional (but not conditional) are commutative.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Associativity ===

Conjunction, disjunction, and biconditional (but not conditional) are associative.

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \land \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land (\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q})\lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor (\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q})\leftrightarrow \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow (\mathrm{Q} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Distribution ===

We list ten distribution laws.  Of these, probably the most important are that conjunction and disjunction distribute over each other and that conditional distributes over itself.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land (\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land (\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor (\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor (\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor (\mathrm{Q} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}) \leftrightarrow (\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{Q} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \leftrightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Transitivity ===

Conjunction, conditional, and biconditional (but not disjunction) are transitive.

: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ (\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R}) \rightarrow \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}) \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{Q} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{R}) \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Other tautologies and equivalences ==

=== Conditionals ===

These tautologies and equivalences are mostly about conditionals.

: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P} \qquad \qquad \vDash\ \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q} \qquad \qquad \vDash\ \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Conditional addition''
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Conditional addition''
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Contraposition''
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png|is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Exportation''

=== Biconditionals ===

These tautologies and equivalences are mostly about biconditionals.

: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Biconditional addition''
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \lnot \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Biconditional addition''
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \lor (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \lnot\mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png| is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [[Image:EquivalenceSign.png| is equivalent to]] &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \lnot\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Miscellaneous ===

We repeat DeMorgan's Laws from the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility#Interdefinability of connectives|Interdefinability of connectives]] section of [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility | Expressibility]] and add two additional forms.  We also list some additional tautologies and equivalences.

: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''[[w:Idempotence|Idempotence]] for conjunction''
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Idempotence for disjunction''
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Disjunctive addition''
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''Disjunctive addition''
: &lt;math&gt;\vDash\ \mathrm{P} \land \lnot \mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Deduction and reduction principles ==

The following two principles will be used in constructing our derivation system on a later page.  They can easily be proven, but&amp;mdash;since they are neither tautologies nor equivalences&amp;mdash;it takes more than a mere truth table to do so.  We will not attempt the proof here.

=== Deduction principle ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; both be formulae, and let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be a set of formulae.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{If}\ \ \Gamma \cup \{\varphi\} \vDash \psi \mathrm{,\ then}\ \ \Gamma \vDash (\varphi \rightarrow \psi)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reduction principle ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; both be formulae, and let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt; be a set of formulae.

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{If}\ \ \Gamma \cup \{\varphi\} \vDash \psi\ \ \mathrm{and}\ \ \Gamma \cup \{\varphi\} \vDash \lnot\psi \mathrm{,\ then}\ \ \Gamma \vDash \lnot\varphi,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{If}\ \ \Gamma \cup \{\lnot\varphi\} \vDash \psi\ \ \mathrm{and}\ \ \Gamma \cup \{\lnot\varphi\} \vDash \lnot\psi \mathrm{,\ then}\ \ \Gamma \vDash \varphi\,\!&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This outline is not the History of Islam, it's the History of Muslim Theology.

The wars and conquests are entirely excluded.

== A proposed solution ==

As I see it, Islam is the name of a religion and its history would be the history of Islamic theology. In the special case of Islam I believe the history should be extended to include the shari'ah because it is so closely tied to the religion. (As for, example, the history of canon law belongs with the history of the pre-reformation/Catholic Christian church.) 

However I observe that, for many people, Islam means the collection of national states whose rulers declare themselves Muslims. The collection is not coherent enough to be called a culture or a civilization. I propose calling it the Muslim heritage. I propose another wikibook about the the History of the Muslim heritage to cover the &quot;wars and conquests&quot; as well as the cultural triumphs and even a few defeats.

That said I intend to work on this outline and limit it to theology and the shari'ah. [[User:DKleinecke|DKleinecke]] 20:59, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

== this is not a history, it is about the beliefs of Islam ==

When I opened this book entitled &quot;History of Islam&quot;  I expected to find historical references.  Not beliefs and teaching, whoever said that the wars and disputes should not be included is incorrect.  A person would have to include the Crusades in the history of Christianity, so why not here.  I was looking to see how the religion got started.  What I got when I read is that Mohamed had the Holy Koran reveled to him.  Who was Mohamed and why was the Koran shown to him?  I don't know, that is why I was looking at this book.

== Jihad ==

This article has nothing about [[jihad]].--[[User:71.107.223.92|71.107.223.92]] 20:26, 17 July 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Ramjet===

The thrust produced by a ramjet is 

&lt;math&gt; T = \dot{m} u_{inlet} ( \sqrt{\tau_b} - 1 ) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;i&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is the the total temperature ratio produced by the combustor. Metallurgy and the availability of cooling will limit the maximum temperature that can be sustained in the combustor. We can define &lt;i&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; as the maximum total temperature ratio compared to the inlet conditions and &lt;i&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; as the temperature ratio relating the static and total temperatures. Then

&lt;math&gt; \tau_{max} = \tau_b \tau_c = \tau_b \left( 1 + \frac {\gamma-1}{2} M_0^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt; 

Thus as &lt;i&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; increases with speed for a fixed maximum temperature &lt;i&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; stays constant and &lt;i&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; must reduce. If the theoretical frontal area of the ramjet is constant then the mass flow through the ramjet will increase linearly with the Mach number. At the same time the heat added diminishes. The thrust then is:

&lt;math&gt; T = A \rho (M_0 a_0)^2   \left[ \sqrt{\frac{\tau_{max}}{1 + \frac {\gamma-1}{2} M_0^2}} - 1 \right] &lt;/math&gt;


When &lt;i&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;=&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; the term in brackets goes to zero and the thrust vanishes. The thrust for a given &lt;i&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is shown in the following figure (the dashed line is the peak thrust):

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is my page about the famous Internet cartoon, Homestar Runner. Two good sites to check out are:
*[http://www.homestarrunner.com The website itself]
*[http://hrwiki.org A Homestar Runner wiki]

== Homestar Runner characters ==

*1-Up

1-Up is Stinkoman's best friend. He likes to go out and save Pan Pan.

*1936 Homestar Runner

1936 Homestar Runner is poor, but he is smarter than his modern counterpart.

*20X6 Coach Z

See &quot;Futuristic Coach Z.&quot;

*20X6 Homestar Runner

See &quot;1-Up.&quot;

*Arrow'd Guy

Arrow'd Guy is the Teen Girl Squad's worst enemy. He has a number of different talents, including spitting arrows and being in two places at once.

*Blue Laser Commander and Minion

Blue Laser is an evil organization whose purpose is unknown, even though it has been suspected of trying to make it snow at the beach. The commander can be distinguished from his henchmen through his uniform and high voice. Like all classic boss-villains, his henchmen are notoriously stupid.

*Bubs

Bubs is a sneaky salesperson who runs the concession stand. He's also a good dancer.

*Cheerleader

Cheerleader is popular, and she rules over the Teen Girl Squad. Apparently, she is the only thing keeping them from being a much friendlier TGS.

*Coach Z

He has a thick accent, but he is a decent singer. Sometimes, he's even as strange as Homestar Runner.

*Crackotage

Crackotage is a Cheat Commando. He knows his rhymes and gadgets, and he can fly jets.

*Cutesy Buttons

Cutesy Buttons is a girl that Dangeresque must rescue. She is played by Marzipan.

*Dangeresque

Dangeresque is a great fighting hero, and why not? He's played by none other than Strong Bad. He is also said to fight the law and be a celebrity pharmacist, but these claims are dubious.

*Dangeresque, Too

Dangeresque, Too is played by Homestar Runner. He helps the regular Dangeresque, but they have their disagreements. He wears cool shades.

*Dripping Yellow Madness

Dripping Yellow Madness is mentioned in one of the toons. Apparently, he's yellow and drippy.

*Fat Dudley

Fat Dudley is the 1936 version of Pom Pom. Although he doesn't speak bubbles, he is only understood by the other characters.

*Fightgar

Fightgar is a Cheat Commando who has &quot;facial&quot; hair and a gung-ho personality, apparently.

*Firebert

Firebert is a Cheat Commando who wears black and is good with tools. He seems to speak The Cheat. (Ironically, the name comes from the Strong Bad Email &quot;army,&quot; where The Cheat uses it as a commando name.)

*Flashfight

Flashfight is a Cheat Commando who is &quot;in charge of stuff.&quot;

*Foxface

Foxface is the femme fatale of the Cheat Commandos, even though she hasn't made any major appearances.

*Futuristic Coach Z

He is not a well-known character, but he is apparently the big bad guy in the game ''Stinkoman 20X6.''

*Goomba

You'd be hard-pressed to find out what role Goombas play in Homestar Runner. You already know, don't you? (Here's a hint: look at the Easter eggs in &quot;Pumpkin Carve-nival.&quot;)

*Gunhaver

Gunhaver is the fearless leader of the Cheat Commandos. He thinks very highly of himself and comes to silly conclusions.

*Homestar Runner

Usually known as Homestar, Homestar Runner is the namesake of the show. He is athletic and a little dumb, and he absolutely loves marshmallows. He also has a serious speech impediment.

*Homsar

What do you get if you take Homestar, make him shorter, give him a big mouth, and dumb him down even more? What you would get is something along the lines of Homsar, a cute little guy who does odd jobs and speaks jibberish.

*Jhonka

The Jhonka is a caveman-like monster who has a lot of money.

*Kerrek

The Kerrek is not very friendly. Although Trogdor smote him, he can still smite anyone unfortunate enough to get under his huge club.

*Killingyouguy

Killingyouguy is one of Perducci's secret weapons. He is played by Strong Mad.

*King of Peasantry

The King of Peasantry appears in the Peasant's Quest movie short frequently, in spite of the fact that he isn't even mentioned in the game. He does not care about the peasants' well-being.

*Larry

Larry Palaroncini is the lead singer of Limozeen. He is also a friend of Strong Bad.

*Li'l Brudder

Li'l Brudder is a very optimistic puppy with only one leg. He can make people cry.

*Limozeen

Limozeen is a classic rock band. The members are actually just one of the Brothers Chaps in different outfits. (How does he do it?)

*Lion

The lion in Teen Girl Squad is unique in a few ways. For one thing, it has an appetite for teenage girls. Another thing is that it has only three legs (apparently). In one of the Homestar Runner talks, the lion is said to have asked Cheerleader on a date, then eaten her. (Lions also make minor appearances on the site.)

*Little Girl

Little Girl is the niece of the Brothers Chaps. She appears in some puppet shows on the site.

*Marshie

Marshie is the unpopular mascot of Fluffy Puff Marshmallows. He is very cheerful in advertisements, and he appears to be obsessed with the consumable. He wrested the job from Homestar Runner after Homestar forgot his lines.

*Marzipan

Marzipan is a strange woman. She likes tofu and her acoustic guitar, Carol. Her lower body is shaped like a dress skirt.

*Mr. Bland

Mr. Bland is one of the children's book-style characters, and his role in the website hasn't been established yet.

*Mr. Shmallow

Mr. Shmallow is a giant talking air-puffed delight. He is not as enthusiastic as Marshie, but he appears to be like him in all other regards, except for his formal attire (and he isn't partially eaten, unless he's hiding a bite under his top hat).

*Mrs. Commanderson

Mrs. Commanderson is the Teeny Tiny Girl Squad's preschool teacher. She apparently works with the Cheat Commandos, and she looks like a pterodactyl.

*Mrs. So and So-erson

Mrs. So and So-erson is So and So's stepmother. She looks like Arrow'd Guy in a costume and makeup.

*Nebulon

Nebulon makes two appearances on the site. He shows up in &quot;New Boots&quot; and is a boss character in the game &quot;Stinkoman 20X6.&quot;

*Nibbles

Nibbles is a talking Fluffy Puff Nibblin that makes one appearance on the site (Strong Bad Email &quot;bottom 10&quot;). He acts and talks like a toddler.

*Pan Pan

Pan Pan is a giant panda. He is like Pom Pom except that he's more like an animal. 1-Up really likes him.

*Passerby

Passerby is caught walking by Dangeresque and Dangeresque, Too in one of the movies. He helps out Perducci. He is played by an unwilling Strong Sad.

*Perducci

Perducci is one of Dangeresque's fierce nemeses. He is played by the King of Town.

*Pikachu

Pikachu makes only one cameo appearance on the website (The Cheat Theme Song), but it's still a testament to his popularity.

*Pom Pom

Pom Pom speaks a strange language. Apparently, the ladies really like him. He hasn't appeared very often in recent cartoons.

*Rather Dashing

Rather Dashing is a peasant who swears revenge on Trogdor after his cottage is burninated. His quest involves stinking, dressing, and being on fire like a peasant.

*Raynaldo

Raynaldo helps Dangeresque in the movies and gives him missions. He is played by Coach Z.

*Reynold

Poor Reynold. He is like the Strong Sad of the Cheat Commandos. He doesn't get to go on any missions, and he's got a boring personality.

*Senor Cardgage

Senor Cardgage is a strange man who speaks jibberish and has a beer belly and a goatee. He looks a lot like Strong Bad and owns a mortgage company called Senor Cardgage Mortgage. He gives Strong Sad nightmares.

*Señor

Señor (who is also called Senor (not to be confused with Senor Cardgage) and Senor-Havin'-A-Little-Trouble) is a cute little character from &quot;The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest Man in the World Contest.&quot; He makes cameo appearances in old-style toons.

*Sickly Sam

Sickly Sam is the 1936 version of Strong Sad, who is very poor and receives no compensation for his begging.

*So and So

So and So is the most booksmart member of the Teen Girl Squad. She also has an imaginary friend.

*Stan

Stan used to work for Bubs. He was fired after the fifth grade.

*Stinkoman

Stinkoman is a fighter from the future who looks for challenges. He looks a lot like Strong Bad, so some people look at him as a futuristic Strong Bad, but his personality does not support this. His two best friends are 1-Up and Pan Pan.

*Strong Bad

The middle brother of the Strongs, Strong Bad has an overinflated ego. He is the most popular character, and he has his own e-mail show.

*Strong Mad

Strong Mad is Strong Bad's older brother, a big, muscley guy who isn't very bright. He's The Cheat's best friend.

*Strong Man

The 1936 version of Strong Mad. He is like his present-day counterpart, but he only growls instead of talking.

*Strong Sad

Strong Sad is Strong Bad's unfortunate younger brother. He is a nerd who likes board games, and his two brothers beat him up every hour on the hour.

*The Announcer

The Announcer makes minor appearances on the site. He announces things, naturally.

*The Barbershop Trio

A 1936 version of The Announcer, even though there are three of him.

*The Blacksmith

He appears in &quot;The King of Town DVD.&quot; He doesn't know what happened to the King's sheep.

*The Cheat

The Cheat speaks a different language and serves Strong Bad. He is a computer nerd, but his cartoons aren't great.

*The Grape Fairie

The King of grapes from the original book. He rides a giant bee.

*The King of Town

The King of Town has the biggest eating problem in Free Country USA. If anyone there gets a heart attack, it will probably be him.

*The Little Chef Guy

The King of Town's personal chef exposed him in the toon &quot;The King of Town.&quot; He is mentioned in the toon where the KOT tries to check his e-mail.

*The Man With the Huge Mouth

This is a classical name for &quot;Arrow'd Guy.&quot;

*The Poopsmith

The Poopsmith has terrible luck. He has the worst job in Free Country USA, which means that he might not talk, even if he didn't take a vow of silence.

*The Robot

There is a robot that appears in &quot;Everybody to the Limit&quot; and &quot;Senor Cardgage Mortgage.&quot; Many things about him are unfamiliar.

*The Shareholders

The shareholders of the company that Strong Bad works at are two very serious people who give earnings high importance.

*The Sneak

The Sneak is the 1936 version of The Cheat. He is similar to his modern counterpart, but he looks like a rat.

*The Strong Bad

The Strong Bad is the 1936 version of Strong Bad. He is mean, just like the present-day Strong Bad.

*The Thnikkaman

The Thnikkaman's distracting powers are legend, even though he looks like Bubs wearing the letters &quot;th&quot; on a card. Oh wait, I gotta go. It's the Thnikkaman!

*The Ugly One

The Ugly One is supposedly ugly, but how ugly she is is a matter of opinion (of course). Not much is known about her other than that.

*The Yello Dello

The Yello Dello only appears in the Yello Dello DVD toon and one of the main pages (Homestar falling). It is supposed to be majestic.

*They Might Be Giants (TMBG)

They aren't a character in the same sense the other characters are, but they have made appearances.

*Thy Dungeonman

Thy Dungeonman is a dungeon custodian who is the star of &quot;Thy Dungeonman&quot; and &quot;Thy Dungeonman 2.&quot; He originally doesn't know what parapets are, and he would rather take his loincloth off than die.

*Trogador

Trogador is said to have appeared at a Homestar Runner convention. He is one of Stinkoman's enemies.

*Trogdor

Trogdor may be the most popular character from the site, and he is even known to people with little or no knowledge about the website itself. He burninates, squishes, and does much more.

*What's Her Face

As her name suggests, she is very unpopular; however, she is the common sense of the Teen Girl Squad.

'''Kurma''' is a sweet fried dough coated in a sugar syrup.

==Ingredients==
===Kurma dough===
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (finely grated)
*1 tin (1 2/3 cups) [[Cookbook:Evaporated milk|evaporated milk]]
*2/3 tin (1 1/4 cups) [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|condensed milk]]
*2 tbsp. coconut cream
*6 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] powder
*1 stick (1/2 cup) [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:margarine|margarine]]
*6 dashes Angostura bitters

===Sugar syrup===
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

==Procedure==
===Kurma dough===
#Mix flour, ginger, cinnamon, and butter in a large bowl.
#Mix evaporated milk, coconut cream, condensed milk, and Angostura bitters in a separate bowl.
#Pour the liquid mixture into the mixture of dry ingredients a little bit at a time. Mix until a dough forms. The dough should be &quot;tough;&quot; that is, not stretchy.
#Divide the dough into two balls. This makes it more manageable. Roll each ball out until about 1 cm thick.
#Cut dough into strips.
#Heat 1/2 cup of oil at medium-high heat. 
#Fry batches of the kurma dough. Turn often.
#Remove when golden brown on all sides.

===Sugar syrup===
#Heat sugar and water at medium heat.
#Stir so that sugar is completely wet.
#When mixture is clear, remove from heat.
#Pour over kurma, stir quickly to coat evenly.

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
*Short, thin strips of dough work best. Fat, long pieces tend to fall apart and be soft inside.
*If kurma is browning quickly and unevenly, turn heat down.

      <comment>/* Advantages of surveys */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The survey method of data collection is likely the most common of the four major methods.  The benefits of this method include its low financial cost and its large sample size.  The very large issue with the survey is its accuracy.  More often than not, there is a large disparity between people's stated opinions and their expressed opinions.  The survey is a reflection only of their stated opinions, and thus is fundamentally inaccurate.  Properly interpreted, surveys may be used to understand a person's viewpoints on a matter, but this analysis is very difficult and also leaves much room for doubt.  All in all, surveys have limited use in studying actual social action, but are inexpensive and are an excellent way to gain an understanding of a person's attitude toward a matter.

== Advantages of surveys ==
The advantages of survey techniques include:
* It is an efficient way of collecting information from a large number of respondents. Very large samples are possible. Statistical techniques can be used to determine validity, reliability, and statistical significance.
* Surveys are flexible in the sense that a wide range of information can be collected. They can be used to study attitudes, values, beliefs, and past behaviors.
* Because they are standardized, they are relatively free from several types of errors.
* They are relatively easy to administer. 
* There is an economy in data collection due to the focus provided by standardized questions. Only questions of interest to the researcher are asked, recorded, codified, and analyzed. Time and money is not spent on tangential questions.

==Disadvantages of surveys==
Disadvantages of survey techniques include:
*They depend on subjects’ motivation, honesty, memory, and ability to respond. Subjects may not be aware of their reasons for any given action. They may have forgotten their reasons. They may not be motivated to give accurate answers, in fact, they may be motivated to give answers that present themselves in a favorable light. 
*Surveys are not appropriate for studying complex social phenomena. The individual is not the best unit of analysis in these cases.  Surveys do not give a full sense of social processes and the analysis seems superficial.
*Structured surveys, particularly those with closed ended questions, may have low validity when researching affective variables.
*Survey samples are usually self-selected, and therefore non-probability samples from which the characteristics of the population sampled cannot be inferred.

      <comment>/* Fairy chess */ Oops.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Just as chess has changed over the centuries that it has been played, there are people who try to add new features or ideas to chess even now.  Sometimes this is just a minor rule change to make things interesting, but sometimes there are whole new ideas that are proposed that will modify chess so substantially that it essentially is a whole new game to be played.  The following are some chess variants to be considered if you want to experiment with alternative ideas for playing chess:

Many other chess variants can be [[w:Chess variant|found on Wikipedia]].

* [[/Random Opening Chess/]]
* [[Arimaa]]
* [[/Bug House/]] and [[/Crazy House/]]
* [[/Crazy House/]] (see [[/Bug House/]])
* [[/Chinese Chess/]] or [[/Chinese Chess/|Xiangqi]]

== Fairy chess ==

It is possible to invent a piece that moves according to any defined set of rules.  In fairy chess, pieces are typically divided into three categories: leapers, riders, and hoppers.

A '''leaper''' moves directly from one square to another, regardless of the position of any other pieces on the board.  In ordinary chess, the knight is a (2,1) leaper: it moves one square horizontally and two squares vertically, or vice versa.  The king is a hybrid (1,0) and (1,1) leaper: it moves to any adjacent square.

Fairy chess has pieces called camels and zebras: these are long-range leapers like knights, except that they leap (3,1) and (3,2) respectively.  Note that a (3,1) leaper, like a bishop, always stays on squares of the same color, but a (3,2) leaper, like a knight, always moves to a square of the opposite color.

A '''rider''' is a leaper that can make multiple leaps in the same direction on the same move.  In ordinary chess, the bishop is a (1,1) rider: it can move to any square diagonally, no matter how far away it is, as long as there is no other piece blocking the diagonal line.  Similary, the rook is a (1,0) rider.  The queen is a hybrid (1,1) and (1,0) rider.

A special fairy chess rider is the nightrider or knightrider.  This is a knight that can make consecutive knight-hops in the same direction on the same move.

A '''hopper''' is a piece that moves in a line while hopping over another piece.  There are no hoppers in ordinary chess, but the capture rule in checkers is a kind of hop: the capturing piece jumps over the opponent's piece, which is then removed from the board.  Also, the cannon in [[Chess/Variants/Chinese Chess|Xiangqi]] is a hopper.  In fairy chess, a hopper may or may not be restricted to jumping over pieces of one color or the other; and the piece that is jumped over may either stay on the board or be removed, depending on the rules for that particular hopper.

The prototypical fairy chess hopper is the grasshopper.  It moves in any direction, like a queen, but it can move only by hopping over another piece, and it lands one square beyond that piece.  The piece that is jumped over is not removed from the board; however, a locust is a special type of grasshopper, which captures an enemy piece over which it jumps.

T. R. Dawson, one of the most prolific chess composers of all time, defined the concepts of fairy chess in the 1930s, and produced many problems using invented pieces such as the nightrider and grasshopper.  Fairy chess has become a popular domain for chess composing and solving, especially because it offers a level of creativity that is sometimes hard to find in the more thoroughly developed areas of traditional chess composition.

Polish up the links and discussion a bit for now, I believe with some work, people will understand where this is going.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Idaho2000. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Idaho2000~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dates And Times ==

ACT tests are given six times a year on Saturday mornings, usually at 8:00 am.  For students who aren’t able to take the test on a Saturday due to religious restraints, there are non-Saturday test dates, although there aren’t nearly as many locations for non-Saturday tests.

== When To Take The Test ==

Students normally take the ACT as a junior or senior.  There are a couple main considerations for deciding if you want to take it as a junior or a senior.  The first main consideration is application date for schools.  The other consideration is application dates for scholarships.  If you take the ACT as a junior, it gives you more time to make decisions and you can always retake the test if you do poorly.

== How To Register ==

=== Registering By Mail ===
To register, get a packet from your high school counselor's office.  If your counselor is out, you can contact ACT to request a packet.  The registration contact information is:

(319) 337-1270	Mon.–Fri., 8:00 a.m.–8:00 p.m., central time

or

ACT Registration
P.O. Box 414, 
Iowa City, IA 52243-0414

You can also request a packet [http://www.actstudent.org/forms/stud_req.html| here].

The registration packet includes a booklet called Registering for the ACT Assessment and a booklet that contains a practice test.  You will need to fill out the form and send it to ACT in the envelope.

=== Registering Online ===
To register online, go [http://www.actstudent.org/regist/elecreg.html| here].  You will need a MasterCard or Visa.  You cannot register online if you are:
*Testing outside the US
*Requesting testing accommodations for a disability
*Requesting a fee waiver
*Using a state-funded voucher to cover the basic fee
*Enrolled in 6th, 7th, 8th, or 9th grade and younger than 13 (you can register online anyway if you are 13 or older)
*Requesting arranged testing (Go [http://www.actstudent.org/pdf/arranged.pdf| here] for more information.)

== Fees ==
*Test     $31.00
*Writing Test     $15.00
*Reports for a 5th and 6th College
**Regular     $7.00 per extra report
**Priority     $12.00 per extra report
**Mailgram     $17.00 per extra report
*Late Fee     $20.00
*Test Date Change     $20.00
*Test Location Change     $20.00
*Stand-By Testing     $40.00
*Test Information Release     $14.00
*Viewing Scores Early     FREE
*Testing Outside of the US     $18.00
*Telephone Registration     $12.00

ACT gives a limited number of fee waivers to those who cannot afford to pay the testing fee.  To apply for a fee waiver, see the information on [http://www.actstudent.org/faq/answers/feewaiver.html| this] web page.

===Test===
The basic ACT

=== Writing Test ===
The ACT Writing Test

=== Reports for a 5th and 6th College ===
You are given the opportunity to send score reports to four colleges free of charge.  If you want to send score reports to a 5th or 6th college, you can order an extra report.  If you need expedited service, Priority reports arrive in three business days and Mailgram reports arrive in one or two business days.

=== Late Fee ===
If you have missed the original application date you can pay the late fee and still be guaranteed a seat on that day if you register by the late registration deadline.

=== Test Date Change ===
This fee is given when you request to be tested on a different date when you are absent the first date.  If you request the change after a set deadline, you will also be charged a fee.

=== Test Location Change ===
Change your location but keep the same date

=== Stand-By Testing ===
After all registered students are seated, you can be given a seat if there are still enough seats, test booklets, and proctors to oversee your test.  You are not guaranteed a seat.

=== Test Information Release ===
If you pay for this service you will receive your answers, the test questions, a list of the correct answers, and scoring instructions.  This service isn’t given for every test date.

=== Viewing Scores Early ===
This allows you to see your scores online about two weeks after the test.

=== Testing Outside of the US ===
You must register in the manner laid out [http://www.actstudent.org/regist/outside.html| here].  The writing test is not offered outside of the US.

=== Telephone Registration ===
By calling (319) 337-1270 you can register for the ACT if you have taken it in the past two years.  ACT claims that this is the fastest way to register for the test.

== After You Register ==
After you register, you should receive a admission ticket that gives specific information about the testing center, what time the test is, etc.  Make sure that the information on your ticket is correct.  If it is not, follow the instructions given on the ticket as to what you should do.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bioinformatics is a branch of biology which implements the use of computers to help answer biological questions. Classical biology involves the use of experiments, where a hypothesis is formed and objectively tested. Bioinformaticians, too, perform experiments but they may involve building computational models or using analyses to derive useful information from raw data. The possibilities of using computers with biology are vast: any biological problem can involve the use of computers.

However when one mentions bioinformatics, some applications pop up more often than others. These might include sequence alignments, searching for sequence patterns and other work with DNA, RNA or protein sequence data. This is because of the increasing amount of genome sequencing projects being completed and the usefulness that computers have brought to the analysis of genomic sequences.

Bioinformatics is a growing discipline and as computers get more sophisticated, it will be a very important complement to experimental biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The perspective of another person is perhaps the most important thing towards becoming smarter. It's the one thing that you cannot gain by yourself. This is the advantage of Wiki. Traditionally we learn from teachers,professors or academic scholars. I believe that there is so much potential knowledge hidden within the ranks of an ordinary person. Sometimes it takes an innocent little kid to make an observation that no grown up can. That is perspective.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What country did they live in?==

[[Image:Mx-map.png|thumb|right|Map of [[w:Mexico|Mexico]] ]]

The Aztecs lived in what is now Mexico. The name Mexico comes from the Aztec word ''Mexica'', a name they used to describe themselves. Their capital city, Tenochtitlan, was located where Mexico City is today.


==What did their buildings look like?==
The Aztec's city, Tenochtitlan, was built on a self-made island. When they first arrived in the area, there was nothing but a swampy island in the middle of Lake Texcoco. They developed a system, called the ''chinampa'' system to dry the land by setting up small plots in which they produced all the food they needed. When enough land was dry they would begin to build there. Over time, they added to the size of the island using this system.

===Tenochtitlan===
Tenochtitlan was divided into four zones or ''campan''. Each ''campan'' was divided into 20 districts (''calpullis''), and each ''calpulli'' was crossed by streets, or ''tlaxilcalli''. There were three main streets that crossed the city and extended to firm land;  the ''calpullis'' were divided by channels used for transportation, with wood bridges that were removed at night. Each ''calpulli'' had its own ''tianquiztli'' (marketplace), but there was also a main marketplace in Tlatelolco. 

Tenochtitlan was created symmetrical, that is, a mirror image on both sides. At the heart of the city lay public buildings, temples and schools. Inside a walled square, 300 meters to the side, was the ceremonial center. There were public buildings, the main temple, the temple of Quetzalcoatl, the ball game, the ''tzompantli'', or rack of skulls, the temple of the sun, the platforms for the sacrifice of gladiators, and some minor temples. Outside was the palace of Moctezuma. Nearby was the ''cuicalli'' or house of the songs, and the ''calmecac'', or school. All construction had to be approved by the ''calmimilocatl'', a person in charge of city planning. 

Moctezuma's palace had 100 rooms and bathrooms for the lords and ambassadors of allies and conquered people. It also had two zoos, one for birds of prey and another for other birds, reptiles, and mammals. There was also a botanical garden and an aquarium. The aquarium had ten salt water ponds and ten fresh water ponds, containing fish and aquatic birds.

==What did they wear?==
Aztec men wore cloth around their waists and cloaks around their shoulders. Aztec women wore sleeveless blouses and wraparound skirts. Nobles dressed in brightly coloured cotton clothes decorated in gold and feathers. This was done to attract attention to themselves. The poor wore clothes made of maguey fibres, and slaves did not wear much at all!

The Aztec army dressed differently from everyday people. Warriors wore vests made of quilted cotton, feathered plumes dusted with stones and precious metals. They also wore collars, bracelets and earrings made of the same materials. Depending on how many enemies they captured, warriors could earn the right to wear animal costumes. Chiefs wore layers of gold or silver with feathers underneath. Both chiefs and warriors wore wooden helmets shaped like animals, and carried shields made of woven reeds and feathers. Common soldiers did not have these items. They painted themselves in the colours of their chief's banner, and wore a simple girdle.

When sacrificing humans to the gods, priests wore black blood-stained robes, while the victim was painted with chalk. Often, masks were worn during the ceremony. 

[[Image:AhuitzotlGlyphHarvard.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The name glyph for Ahuitzotl, an Aztec emperor.]]

==What did their writing look like?==
Like the Mayans, the Aztecs wrote using a series of glyphs, or pictures. For example, a snake (coatl) was represented by a drawing of a snake's head. Numbers below 20 were represented by a series of dots. Numbers larger than 20 were represented by glyphs. For example, the number 500 would be represented by a feather and four flags (400 + 5*20 = 500). To show that glyphs belonged to a single group, a line was drawn to connect them. Next, a line was drawn to the object being counted.

==What did they believe?==
[[Image:YaxchilanDivineSerpent.jpg|thumb|right|[[w:Quetzalcoatl|Quetzalcoatl]] ]]

According to Aztec legend, the ancestors of the Aztecs came from a place in the north called Aztlán. They were guided by a god named Huitzilopochtli, meaning &quot;Left-handed Hummingbird.&quot; There was a prophecy that said that they should build their home where they saw an eagle eating a snake while perched on a nopal cactus. When they arrived on the island in Lake Texcoco, they saw this, and settled there.

The Aztecs also believed that their ancestors were considered by other groups to be uncivilized. However, they decided to learn, and took knowledge from other peoples, especially the Toltec. They believed all culture came from them.

The Aztecs had several creation myths. One said that there were four ages before our time, each of which ended in a catastrophe. Our age – ''Nahui-Ollin'', the fifth age, or fifth creation – escaped destruction because of the sacrifice of Nanahuatl (&quot;full of sores&quot;, the smallest and humblest of the gods), who was transformed into the Sun. Another says that Earth was created by the twin gods  Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl. Tezcatlipoca lost his foot in the process of creating the world and all representations of these gods show him without a foot and with a bone exposed.

==Are some of them famous even today?==
At the time of the arrival of the Spanish, Emperor Moctezuma ruled over Tenochtitlan. His name in Nahuatl, pronounced Mo–tekw–so–ma, meant &quot;he who makes himself ruler by his rage.&quot; 

Legend has it that ten years before the Spanish arrived, eight things happened that signaled the fall of the Aztec empire. They were:

# A comet appeared in the sky during the day.
# A pillar of fire (possibly the comet) appeared in the night sky.
# The temple of Huitzilopochtli was destroyed by fire.
# A bolt of lightning struck the Tzonmolco temple.
# Tenochtitlan was flooded.
# Strange people with many heads but one body were seen walking through that city.
# A woman was heard weeping a dirge for the Aztecs.
# A strange bird (quetzal) was caught. When Moctezuma looked into its mirror-like eyes, he saw unfamiliar men landing on the coast.

In the spring of 1519, Moctezuma received reports of strange men off the coast of his empire. At first, the emperor sent an ambassador with a costume of Tlaloc, and another of Quetzalcoatl. When the ambassador met conquistador Hernán Cortés, he thought he looked like Quetzalcoatl. He told  Moctezuma, who tried to stop him from coming to Tenochtitlan. He sent gold, wizards, priests, and even one of his ambassadors, Tzihuacpopoca, who pretended to be the emperor.

Eventually, Moctezuma met Hernán Cortés. He believed he was the god Quetzalcoatl. He took him to his garden and gave him flowers, the greatest honour he could give. When Cortés ordered a halt to the human sacrifices, he agreed. He even offered to be baptized a Christian and become a subject of King Charles I of Spain. 

When Cortés went to meet other Spaniards on the coast, deputy governor Pedro de Alvarado took over. He stopped the Aztecs from celebrating Toxcatl, and killed most of the important upper class Aztecs in what is known as &quot;The Massacre in the Main Temple.&quot; Between 350 to 1000 people died. This enraged the Aztecs, who revolted. Moctezuma was then taken by the Spanish. On July 1, 1520, Moctezuma appeared on the balcony of his palace, pleading with his people to retreat. Instead, they threw rocks at him, and he died shortly after the attack.

After the death of Moctezuma, there were only two other emperors. One died of smallpox, the last Aztec emperor was named Cuahutemoc, and to make him confess where the Aztec wealth was kept, they burned his feet until finally his death came very possibly from shock, or so Mexican scholars say. One year later, the Aztec empire had crumbled. Techichpotzin, Moctezuma's daughter, inherited his wealth. She was baptized a Christian and given the name Isabel Moctezuma. She married a total of five times before she died.

==What is left of them today?==
Although the Aztecs no longer exist, their influence is still felt in Mexico. More than 60% of the population are ''mestizo'' or mixed. This means that some of their ancestors were Aztec. There are also over 1.5 million people in Mexico who speak Nahuatl, which comes from the Classical Nahuatl spoken by the Aztecs.

The Nahuatl language has given many words to English, usually through Spanish. Here is a list of some English words of Nahuatl origin:

*avocado: from ahuacatl (fruit)
*chilli: from chilli (vegetable) 
*chocolate: from xocolatl (drink)
*cocoa: from cacahuatl (fruit/nut)
*coyote: from coyotl (mammal)
*ocelot: from ocelotl (mammal)
*shack: from xacalli (structure)
*tomato: from (xi)tomatl (fruit/berry)

''See also: [[w:Turkish_language|Turkish language]]''
===History===
The earliest forms of the Turkish language were written in [[w:Orkhon_script|Orkhon script]].

During the Ottoman Empire, Ottoman Turkish was influenced mainly by [[Arabic]] and [[Persian]]. The primary writing system was based on Arabic and Persian script. Due to the difficulty of learning the script only about 10% of the Ottoman Turkish population were literate.

[[Image:Ataturk-September_20,_1928.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Atatürk introducing the new Turkish alphabet to the Turkish public.]]
However, in 1928, modern Turkey's hero, [[w:Mustafa_Kemal_Ataturk|Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], had changed many things about the Turkish language. He changed the writing system to a Turkish variant of the Latin alphabet (without the letters Q, W or X, and added the letters '''Ö''' and '''Ü''' from German, '''Ç''' from Albanian, '''Ş''' from Romanian; and also added the letters '''Ğ''', '''I''', and '''İ''' to represent certain sounds which weren't present in any other Latin-based languages at the time), and replaced many loanwords with older or constructed Turkish words. The change of the writing system heavily benefited Turkey's youth, and during the 1930s, the literacy rate shot up to 70%. Today, the overall literacy rate is approximately 87%, but the reason for the seemingly low literacy rate (for our time) has to do with personal family matters rather than any difficulty, even though it's compulsory for all Turks to go to school up to the age of 16, so technically their parents are both breaking the law and depriving their children of a wonderful gift: knowing how to read and write.

===Geographic distribution of Turkish===
[[Image:MapofTurkishspeakers.png|left|200px|thumb|A map showing the number of Turkish speakers by country.]]
In terms of number of speakers, Turkish is the largest Turkic language in the world, spoken by over million people worldwide.

Turkish is the official language of [[w:Turkey|Turkey]] and the [[w:Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], and is a recognized minority language in [[w:Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[w:Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. It is also an official language in the Republic of Cyprus.

There are also two million Turcophones in Germany, due to its very large Turkish minority living there; a slightly smaller minority living in Bulgaria; and also over 100,000 living in France, Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Austria, United States and Uzbekistan. There are also smaller Turkish-speaking minorities living elsewhere, most notably Greece, Russia, Canada and Azerbaijan*.

====Dialects====
=====Within Turkey=====
Standard Turkish is basically the Turkish spoken in Istanbul, which has no particular accent, and is spoken clearly, smoothly and slang words are non-existent.

[[Image:Tulumcu.jpg|right|thumb|A Laz man playing a Tulum, a Turkish instrument played mainly along the East Black Sea coast.]]
However, Turkey is a place full of surprises and diversity, and many dialects of Turkish exist. Here are the most common:
*''Rumelice'', which is spoken by muhajirs in the Rumelian area.
*''Edirne'', spoken by the inhabitants of Edirne*.
*''Doğu'', spoken in eastern Turkey, influenced by Azerbaijani.
*''Güneydoğu'', spoken in southeastern Turkey, heavily influenced by Kurdish.
*''Karadeniz'', the former spoken in northern Turkey in areas surrounding the Black Sea.*

=====Outside Turkey=====
*''Karamanlıca'' - spoken in Greece by [[w:Karamanlides|Karamanlides]], a Greek Orthodox, Turkish-speaking people whose ancestry goes back to central Anatolia.
*''Kıbrıs'' - a dialect of Turkish spoken by Turkish Cypriots.

So yes, there's a variety of different dialects spoken by Turks, but don't let that put you off, because most Turks, regardless of whether they speak standard Turkish or a certain dialect, will understand standard Turkish, as it's the standard for all schools in Turkey and Northern Cyprus.

==Learning the language==
Many people whose native language is not Turkish complain that Turkish is very hard to learn. Turkish, being an Altaic language, has grammar and vocabulary that is very different from Indo-European languages. Learning Dutch for a Brit or learning Italian for a Romanian is much easier than them learning Turkish. On the other hand, there are similar languages to Turkish such as Mongolian or Kazakh.

=== Advantages of Turkish (for English) ===
*There is no pronunciation help next to the word. Because every letter is pronounced the same in every word.
*:'''Turkish is a phonetic language.'''
*:Learning the alphabet is enough to pronounce the word correctly.
*:Once you hear a word, you'll know where to look in the dictionary.
*There are no dots dividing the word into its syllables or marks indicating a stressed syllable.
*:Spelling determines the syllable count and stress.

*:'''Turkish nouns have no gender and its verbs, except for &quot;to be&quot; are all regular.'''
*:Look at a noun and you'll know all its declensions.  
*:Look at a verb and you'll know its tense, voice, etc.
*'''Turkish has no articles.'''
*You can hardly ever find exceptions in Turkish. Nearly all words obey strict rules.

=== Disadvantages of Turkish (for English) ===
*'''Unlike in English, all Turkish nouns are inflected for case'''
*'''Turkish verbs focus on aspect, modality, and evidentiality more than English'''.

===The benefits of learning Turkish===

Approximately 250 million people worldwide speak a Turkic language, Turkish being the most common. However, all Turkic languages have a very high degree of mutual intelligibility, therefore learning Turkish means you can speak to 100 million more people properly, and 150 million more roughly, but still understanding the basic gist of the conversation.

So, 250 million, that's a lot of people, huh? Doesn't that sound like good business and marketing opportunities to you? Trust me, Turkic countries aren't as impoverished as you think. The West's definition of poor is actually very exaggerated. Many, much poorer countries are still good places to do business. Take Africa, for example. At the moment African countries have the fastest growing mobile market in the world. When entrepreneurs hear news like this, they immediately appreciate Africa's potential to generate lots of revenue in the mobile phone industry. As for Turkey, it's richer and in better shape than most African countries, so financially you could do really well there. As a matter of fact, Turkey is a member of the G20, and is the 17th most industrialised country in the world. Turkey's GDP ranks 17th, and has one of the fastest GDP growth rates in the world. Turkey has a developed services sector; a large, rapidly growing tourism sector; as well as construction, electronics, textiles and automotive industries which are very important to Turkey's economy. So who says Turkey's economy is bad?

Turkey and Northern Cyprus are also political hotspots, with many things going on in the Turkish parliament and politics. If you ever have to deal with Turkish or Turkish Cypriot affairs, learning the language would be highly beneficial.

On a much less serious matter, Turkish is a very beautiful-sounding language. Turkey and Northern Cyprus are actually incredibly beautiful places themselves, and are definitely worth visiting, so knowing the local language would be very useful.

==Related languages==
There are many languages related to Turkish in the Turkic family. Of these, Wikibooks of the following languages are available.

*[[Azerbaijani]]
*[[Turkmen]]
*[[Uzbek]]

Azerbaijani and Turkmen in particular are very closely related to Turkish, about the same as the relation between Spanish and Portuguese.

==Notes about the Introduction==
*&lt;small&gt;All external links in this article link to the English Wikipedia site.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;Turks don't refer to southern Cyprus as ''Kıbrıs Cumhuriyeti'' (i.e. The Republic of Cyprus), because Turkey, and of course ''Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti'' (the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus), are two of the only places in the world which don't recognize it. Instead, they refer to Southern Cyprus as the ''Güney Kıbrıs Rum Yönetimi'' (the Greek Administration of Southern Cyprus).&lt;/small&gt;
**&lt;small&gt;Turks, particularly Cypriot Turks, find it offensive when you refer to Southern Cyprus as ''The Republic of Cyprus'', because the definition of ''The Republic of Cyprus'' takes the entire island into account, including Northern Cyprus.&lt;/small&gt;
**&lt;small&gt;Unlike most languages, when you say the word ''Kıbrıs'', Turks immediately assume you're talking about Northern Cyprus, so when trying to refer to Southern Cyprus, you must say ''Güney Kıbrıs'' (southern Cyprus).&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;Quite a few of the new loanwords are now either seldom used or the old equivalents are used as much as the new ones.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;The Azerbaijani and Turkmen languages are members of the Oghuz, or southwestern subfamily of Turkish, and are therefore extremely similar to Turkish. For example, a Turkish speaker listening to an Azeri conversation, or vice-versa, could probably understand the basic gist of the conversation without having to learn the language of it. Azerbaijani is sometimes even considered as a Turkish dialect.  Uzbek is a member of the Uyghuric subfamily of Turkic, and therefore much less close, though much of the grammar and vocabulary are similar.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;Edirne is the westernmost city in Turkey, and is close to the borders of Greece and Bulgaria. Because of this, the Edirne dialect is influenced by Greek and Bulgarian.{{citation needed}}&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;Laz people have their own language called [[w:Laz_language|Laz language]], which is unrelated to Turkish, but related to [[Georgian]] and spoken mainly in Georgia and the Black Sea region of Turkey.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''This section presents the empirical idea of consciousness. What consciousness is like before theories are applied to explain it. It is based on descriptions from the Historical Review.''
==The definition and description of phenomenal consciousness==

What is it like to be conscious? Before embarking on the analysis of phenomenal consciousness it is important to have a definition of what it is that we are attempting to explain. The article below considers empirical descriptions of phenomenal consciousness. It shows that phenomenal consciousness is the space, time and content of our minds (where the content contains intuitions and feelings). As will be seen in later parts of the book not all philosophers and scientists accept that this &quot;phenomenal consciousness&quot; actually exists.

===Introduction===

Empirical descriptions of phenomenal consciousness have been available in Western literature for centuries and in Eastern literature for millennia. It is often maintained that no-one can define consciousness but there is a large body of literature that gives a clear empirical description of it. Perhaps the claim that no-one can define consciousness is frustration at the fact that no-one can explain consciousness.
 
Weiskrantz (1988) asserted that &quot;Each of us will have his or her own idea of what, if anything, is meant by consciousness...&quot; and that insisting upon a precise definition would be a mistake. Koch and Crick (1999) stated that &quot;Consciousness is a vague term with many usages and will, in the fullness of time, be replaced by a vocabulary that more accurately reflects the contribution of different brain processes.&quot; 

But is consciousness really a &quot;vague term&quot; and should we each have our own idea of what it means? The empirical descriptions of Descartes, Kant and others are summarised below under the headings of space, time, qualia and awareness. These descriptions show that consciousness is not a vague term at all.

===Space and Time===

Kant (1781) argued that our minds must be capable of representing objects in space and time. Experiences presuppose space and time as pure concepts of reason. Without space, objects could not be differentiated and would have no properties. Without representation in time, the concepts of succession of events and simultaneity would be unknown to us. James(1904) also describes experience as extended in space and says that the idea that &quot;inner experience is absolutely inextensive seems to me little short of absurd&quot;. Descartes (1641, Meditation V, 3) was also clear that imaginings and perceptions are experiences where things are arranged in space and time: &quot;In the first place, I distinctly imagine that quantity which the philosophers commonly call continuous, or the extension in length, breadth, and depth that is in this quantity, or rather in the object to which it is attributed. Further, I can enumerate in it many diverse parts, and attribute to each of these all sorts of sizes, figures, situations, and local motions; and, in time, I can assign to each of these motions all degrees of duration.&quot; Descartes was, as was so often the case, well ahead of his time by describing continuity and dimensionality, the factors that define his view of space as an actual vector space accessible to mathematical and physical analysis (See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies:_Descartes_and_the_empiricists#Rene_Descartes_.281596-1650.29 section on Descartes] for a full discussion.)  

Gregory (1966) also pointed out that we see things as if they are projected into space around us. The idea of projection was implicit in Kant’s and Descartes’ descriptions, which are from the viewpoint of an observer looking out at contents of experience, but Gregory is explicit (although he believes that explanations based on the projection are absurd). 

Kant and Descartes describe consciousness as something extended in time but it is Clay and James who draw this fully to our attention. James (1890) quotes E.R. Clay who coined the term &quot;specious present&quot; to describe how we exist for more than a durationless instant and then goes on to say: &quot;In short, the practically cognized present is no knife-edge, but a saddle-back, with a certain breadth of its own on which we sit perched, and from which we look in two directions into time. The unit of composition of our perception of time is a duration, with a bow and a stern, as it were--a rearward--and a forward-looking end. It is only [p. 610] as parts of this duration-block that the relation of succession of one end to the other is perceived. We do not first feel one end and then feel the other after it, and from the perception of the succession infer an interval of time between, but we seem to feel the interval of time as a whole, with its two ends embedded in it.&quot; Notice how James’ observer is at an instant but the mind is stretched over time. 

James’ mental time is probably not the same as physical time. Hermann Weyl, the Nobel prize-winning physicist, wrote that reality is a &quot;four-dimensional continuum which is neither 'time' nor 'space.' Only the consciousness that passes on in one portion of this world experiences the detached piece which comes to meet it and passes behind it, as history, that is, as a process that is going forward in time and takes place in space&quot; (Weyl 1918). In other words consciousness has a way of containing events in the same order as they occur in the world but seems to use a mental time that is different from physical time.

===Qualia=== 

Qualia are types of things that occur in conscious experience. The colour purple is a good example of a quale (Tye, 1997). Hume (1739) pointed out of things in the mind that &quot;[t]here is nothing but the idea of their colour or tangibility, which can render them conceivable by the mind;&quot; in other words, qualia might be things in the mind rather than attributes. Qualia appear to be exceptional and inexplicable: Churchland (1988) writes &quot;How on earth can a feeling of pain result from ions passing across a membrane?&quot; Descartes (Meditations VI, 6, 1641) clearly describes qualia.

===Awareness=== 

Descartes, Locke, Hume, Reid and Kant describe conscious phenomena as if there is an observer in their mind looking out at qualia or feeling qualia in the space and time around about. Descartes and Kant thought that the mind must also contain a conceptualisation or intuition of the meaning of its space, time and content so that the qualia become grouped into objects, the objects into events and the events into meaning and expectation. 

As Kant put it, we have &quot;intuitions&quot; about the relations between things. In modern parlance our conscious experience appears to contain the output from an unconscious processor; although Kant's term, &quot;intuition,&quot; is a more scientific approach because it is an observation without assumptions about causes. If the present is extended in time, or a &quot;specious&quot; present as Clay put it, then many moments are available through which it is possible to apprehend both a question and its answer: the processor can frame the question and provide the answer. The observation that our minds extend through time means that this processor does not need to be recursive to provide the outputs we experience as intuitions (one moment can contain an intuition about another whilst both are in the mind).
 
Descartes (Meditations VI, 10, 1641) considered the origin of intuitions: &quot;Further, I cannot doubt but that there is in me a certain passive faculty of perception, that is, of receiving and taking knowledge of the ideas of sensible things; but this would be useless to me, if there did not also exist in me, or in some other thing, another active faculty capable of forming and producing those ideas. But this active faculty cannot be in me [in as far as I am but a thinking thing], seeing that it does not presuppose thought, and also that those ideas are frequently produced in my mind without my contributing to it in any way, and even frequently contrary to my will.&quot; Descartes suspected that the ideas were formed unconsciously, probably in the brain.

===Types of Consciousness===
 
It is sometimes held that there are many types of consciousness, Antony (2001) lists: phenomenal consciousness, access consciousness, state consciousness, creature consciousness, introspective consciousness and self-consciousness. Antony takes the view that these are all 'modulations' of the term consciousness and do not mean that there are in fact different types of consciousness. In other words these 'types of consciousness' are modulations of the intuition of content arranged in space and time that is the singular consciousness described by Kant and Descartes. According to this explanation access consciousness is the time extended form of processes in phenomenal consciousness, self-consciousness is the time extended form of bodily processes and inner speech etc.. As an example, if we say a word then think it soundlessly it is evident that inner speech is whole, time extended words coming from the vague direction of the vocal chords (or both ears), when we move a limb much of the whole movement is present in our experience as a set of displacements at the position of the limb and extended through time.

The nature of consciousness as described above, i.e. phenomenal or subjective consciousness,  must be distinguished from the type of consciousness used in Medical clinical states. Clinical consciousness is determined partly by the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) in the brain stem extending into higher anatomic levels of the brain including the cortex. Alerting or arousal is the function of the ARAS and is the doorway to awareness. Failure of this system or its components results in clinical states ranging from a temporary loss of consciousness as noted in head injuries (concussion) all the way to complete coma. The comatose state includes failure of eye opening to stimulation, a motor response more than just simple reflex withdrawal movements and lack of verbalization. Coma can be produced by structural lesions of the brain, metabolic and nutritional disorders, exogenous toxins, central nervous system infections, seizures, temperature-related extremes (e.g. hypothermia or hyperthermia) and most commonly trauma. Included in this extreme are such entities as persistent vegetative state and the minimally conscious state. The gamut ranges through stupor, prolonged concussion, and transient concussion. This use of the term ‘consciousness’ is not the nature of ‘consciousness’ as used in this article and must be distinguished as such.

===Observations and Denials=== 

There can be little doubt that most descriptions of conscious phenomenology have described the same things although some have used terms such as 'continuity' for time and 'representation' for space. Our conscious experiences are the experience of being an observer that has qualia distributed in space and time around a point. This experience is imbued with intuitions. 

Contrary to the views of Weiskrantz and of Koch and Crick there seems to be no need to await a definition of consciousness. It has been described for centuries. So why did these authors feel a need to suspend any definition? 

The answer is that over the years there has been no widely accepted theory of how this empirical consciousness could occur. This led certain philosophers such as Ryle (1949) to question whether the description of consciousness was credible. 

In most cases this sceptical analysis begins with an explanatory discussion of consciousness such as: if information travels from the observation to the observer then the observer contains the information so there must be another observer within to observe this second set of information. In this case the conclusion is that this implies an impossible homunculus or Ryle’s &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; so observation and observer’s cannot occur in the mind. This is an interesting argument but it can also be framed to give exactly the opposite result. The scientific form of the argument would be: the observed form of conscious experience cannot occur if it relies on information transfer, therefore the hypothesis that information transfer is all that is required to explain consciousness is wrong and some other explanation is needed. (This means that although the content of consciousness is derived from the senses via signals in neurones, conscious experience is not these signals flowing into a nexus). In science the observation is paramount and cannot be discarded because it conflicts with theory. 

The process of discounting an observation when an explanation fails also applies to other aspects of consciousness studies. As Gregory (1988) put it: &quot; 'If you can’t explain it – deny it' is one strategy for dealing with embarrassing questions such as 'what is consciousness?' &quot;. If we discount these denials then the empirical observations of Kant and Descartes and the other empiricists are the bedrock of consciousness studies and consciousness can indeed be described as an observation containing the space, time and content of our minds (where the content contains intuitions and feelings). 

This simple definition of the experience we call consciousness is internally consistent and can be expressed in mathematical language. Phenomenal consciousness is a multidimensional manifold with vectors pointing towards the centre (the apparent observation point). The content can be both the input and output of processors that are external to the manifold. 

''Adapted from the article [http://www.sci-con.org/news/articles/20020901.html The description and definition of consciousness] by Alex Green in [http://sci-con.org/ Science and Consciousness Review] (with permission of the author).''

A non-mathematical description of consciousness is: a collection of events arranged in time and space that form directed elements that all point at the same place and instant.

===The viewing point and the observer===

Green's summary of phenomenal consciousness deserves further elaboration and description. Science begins with empirical descriptions. To experience phenomenal consciousness simply lean back with your eyes open and listen. Phenomenal consciousness is the observational space and time that is occurring and the simultaneous things within it that point at the apparent viewing point. It includes bodily sensations, inner speech and the smell on and around things etc. Phenomenal consciousness is experience itself. If the experience is a lucid dream it may contain a fantastical image, if it is a perception it may contain information about something in the world beyond the body. Experience is not usually an experience '''of''' the content of experience, experience is already there, arranged in space and time (see note below).

[[Image:constudgreen1.gif|left]] The illustrations show the difference between an actual 3D part of the world, 2D representations of that part of the world, conscious experience itself and naive realism.

It is well known that a 3D object cannot be shown on a 2D surface. Its form is specified as sets of coordinates. 













[[Image:constudgreen2.gif|left]]Most visual experiences are arranged as views. Views are represented on paper using perspective drawings. Pictures that use perspective are scaled images of the world as it would appear on the retina of one eye.



[[Image:constudgreen3.gif|right]]In experience itself things are arranged as things directed at a point (vectors). Nothing flows into the point. Experience is a manifold of events that are loosely based on data from the retinas and other sense organs. It has contents like the drawing on paper but instead of being a collection of ink particles confined to 2D it is a set of vectors directed at a point.




[[Image:constudgreen4.gif|left]]Experience also involves things arranged in time. Things can be simultaneous and there is continuity. Arrangements in time are independent of arrangements in space. The phonemes of a word do not overlap each other and the stages of a movement do not create a smear. These independent arrangements in time are akin to the way that things that are arranged left and right do not overlap things that are arranged up and down. Left and right are independent of up and down. In a similar way, time seems to be an independent direction for arranging things.



[[Image:constudgreen5.gif|right]]Our experience differs from naive realism. In naive realism experience is believed to be an impossible physical meeting of light rays at a single point in the eye that through some unspecified mechanism project back to their source. '''Naive realism is a primitive dynamical interpretation of experience''', an attempt to explain an empirical geometrical form in terms of flows of matter. In contrast, in experience there seems to be a set of vectors directed at a point. 


[[Image:constudgreen6.gif|left]]
An intriguing feature of the empirical form of experience is that things seem to be separated by angular separations.  This allows objects of any size to be represented and explains how a page of text on our laps and the dome of a planetarium can be encompassed in the same form.




The apparent viewing point has caused considerable difficulty for many empiricist philosophers (although the British Empiricists tended to avoid it). When philosophers have stopped describing conscious experience and tried to explain the viewing point they have often resorted to the supernatural: Descartes, Malebranche and Reid all explained the viewing point in terms of a supernatural soul at a point that does the seeing or experiencing. But none of the empiricists describe anything flowing into the viewing point; indeed nothing does flow or could flow into and through a point.  The empirical truth is that the viewing point is a geometrical phenomenon, not the recipient of some simultaneous flow of everything in experience. Just look, your viewing point is where everything in experience is directed but things are not pouring into it and it, itself, is a point, it cannot and does not contain anything. This seems to be Aristotle's insight when he wrote &quot;In every case the mind which is actively thinking is the objects which it thinks.&quot;

The field of vectors that are the content of consciousness are also difficult to interpret; some philosophers believe that they are in the brain and form a representation of the world whilst others believe that they are directly attached to things in the world beyond the body.

The empirical description of consciousness allows us to make a sharp distinction between the scientific activities of measurement and observation. Measurement is the change in state of a measuring instrument in response to an event in the environment. Observation is the occurrence of events in the geometrical manifold that we call our conscious experience.

This section has used the descriptions provided by generations of philosophers to characterise the '''phenomenon''' of consciousness. Many modern philosophers assume that readers are familiar with these empirical descriptions and use &quot;what it is like to be conscious&quot; as a shorthand for these empirical reports.  From the seventeenth century onwards it was realised that these descriptions are difficult to explain using Newtonian physics or elementary information theory.

&lt;font size=1&gt;* Note: the term &quot;experience of&quot; should be reserved for things that act as a source of the content of experience, such as the QM fields that constitute the things that are sensed. We have an &quot;experience of&quot; a flower when signals from the flower are composed into the form of a flower in our experience. Sometimes there is an &quot;experience of&quot; the content of consciousness, for instance when intuitions about the content occur. See later modules for a discussion.&lt;/font&gt;

An alphabetical list of definitions crossreferenced to more thorough explanations in the main text or in external documents.

==A==
; argument : In computing jargon an ''argument'' is one of the pieces of data passed to a [[#procedure|procedure]]. Another name is ''parameter''.
; assign, assigning, assignment: Assignment is one of the fundamental operations of computing.  All it means is copying a ''value'' into the ''memory location'' pointed at by a ''variable''.  The value can be a ''literal'' or the value of some other ''variable'', q.v. [[w:Assignment (computer science)|Assignment]]

==B==
; ByRef : Declares an argument to a [[#procedure|procedure]] as a [[#pointer|pointer]] to the [[#argument|argument]] instead of as a copy of the ''value'' of the argument.  This allows the procedure to permanently change the variable.  If neither ByRef or ByVal is stated, ByRef is assumed by the compiler. 
; ByVal : Declares an argument to a [[#procedure|procedure]] as a copy of the ''value'' of the argument.  The value of the original variable cannot be changed by the procedure.  The value of the newly created variable can be changed within the procedure, but this does not affect the variable it was copied from.  Programs are more robust if variables are declared ByVal whenever possible since this means that an argument will not be unexpectedly changed by calling a function.  This also results in a faster program (see pg 758 of the Microsoft Visual Basic 6 Programmer's Guide).

==C==
; [[../Compiler Directives|compiler directives]] : These are instructions included in the text of the program that affect the way the compiler behaves.  For instance it might be directed to include one or another version of a piece of code depending on whether the target operating system is Windows 95 or Windows XP.

==I==
; Immediate Windows: This is the window in the IDE which receives output from ''Debug.Print''.  See [[../IDE/]]

==J==
; JavaScript: JavaScript is an interpreted language mostly used to provide scripts inside web pages.  It is, however, not confined to such uses.  See [[../JArithmetic|Jarithmetic]], a case study in multilingual programming and [http://www.crockford.com/javascript/ Crockford on JavaScript], the world's most misundertood language.
; JScript : Microsoft's implementation of JavaScript as provided by the Windows Script Host.  See [[../JArithmetic|Jarithmetic]] for an example of its use.

==O==
; Operands and Operators: An ''operand'' is operated on by an ''operator''.  ''Expressions'' are built of ''operands'' and ''operators''.  For instance in this expression:

  a = b + c

there are three operands (a, b, and c) and two operators (= and +).

Operands in Visual Basic Classic are either [[#variable|variables]] or [[#literal|literals]]

==P==
; procedure : A [[#subroutine|subroutine]], [[#function|function]], [[#method|method]], or [[#property|property]]

==R==

; ragged array : An array having rows of differing lengths.  Such arrays are natural in languages such as C and JavaScript but rather unusual in Visual Basic although there is nothing that prevents their creation.  In Visual Basic you can create such an array using the ''Array'' function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;aRagged = Array(Array(1, 2, 3), Array(1, 2))&lt;/source&gt;

:Such arrays are inefficient in Visual Basic because they are implemented as ''Variants'' but functionaly identical arrays can be created as instances of a class and can be made much more efficient both in storage space and execution time, although not quite as efficient as ''C'' arrays.

; real number : A variable that can hold a ''real number'' is one that can hold a number that can have any value including fractional value.  In computer languages variables only approximate real numbers because the irrational numbers are also real, see [[w:Real number|Real number]].  In Visual Basic Classic there are two real number types: Single and Double, see [[../Data Types/]]

; reference: A variable that holds a ''pointer'' to a ''value'' rather than holding the the ''value'' itself.  In strict Visual Basic usage only ''object references'' work like this.

; reference argument : A declaration of an argument using the [[#ByRef|ByRef]] keyword.  ''Reference arguments'' allow the subroutine or function to make changes to the variable in the calling routine.  See [[../Procedures and Functions/]].

==S==
; subroutine : A procedure similar to a function but it does not return a value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Quantum physics tries to explain the properties of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. We use quantum physics to model behaviour and properties of microscopic objects that cannot be modelled by Einsteinian physics, which is the physics used for objects at the macroscopic level (as viewed with the naked eye).

==Does light behave as a wave or as particles?==

Interference experiments, such as Young's Slits (see below) can only be explained if we assume light is a wave. However, the photoelectric effect can only be explained if light is a particle. So what is light - particle or wave?

The best thing to remember is that both waves and particles are nothing more than physical ''models'' for explaining our observations. For example, someone might think of counting apples when they are learning basic arithmetic; this does not mean that numbers are apples, only that we can think of them as such in certain specific circumstances. When we get to the concept of negative numbers, using apples as a model breaks down unsurprisingly. Similarly, in quantum physics, we find that we must use different models for different situations.

===Young's Slits===
Thomas Young conducted a famous experiment in which light was diffracted by a double slit and produced an interference pattern on a screen. An interference pattern is a pattern of bright and dark bands caused by the constructive and destructive interference of the rays from the two slits, and is only a feature of waves. Electrons are usually considered to be particles, but produce apparent interference patterns by diffracting.  To produce an interference pattern, you must have a wavelength. This gives more evidence of Wave-particle duality.&lt;br&gt;

===The Photoelectric Effect===

In analysing the photoelectric effect quantitatively using Einstein's method, the following equivalent equations are used:

Energy of photon = Energy needed to remove an electron + Kinetic energy of the emitted electron

Algebraically:
:&lt;math&gt;hf = \phi + E_{k_{max}} \,&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''h'' is Planck's constant,
* ''f'' is the frequency of the incident photon,
* &lt;math&gt;\phi = h f_0 \ &lt;/math&gt; is the work function, or minimum energy required to remove an electron from atomic binding,
** ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the threshold frequency for the photoelectric effect to occur,
* &lt;math&gt;E_{k_{max}} = \frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons,
** ''m'' is the rest mass of the ejected electron, and
** ''&lt;math&gt; v_m &lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the ejected electron. 

''Note'': If the photon's energy (''hf'') is less than the work function (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), no electron will be emitted. The work function is sometimes denoted &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

==Planck constant==

The physicist Max Planck studied a phenomenon known as black-body radiation, and found that the transmission of light was best treated as packets of energy called photons. The energy of a photon, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, is given by the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;E=h\,f&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the photon, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the Planck constant, &lt;math&gt;6.63 \times 10^{-34}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of the light. Since the velocity of light (which is ''c'' in a vacuum) is given by &lt;math&gt;f\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, it may be helpful to use the equation

&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

if you are given the wavelength of light and not the frequency.

==The Photon Model==
Over the ages, scientists have argued what light actually is. Newton argued that light is composed of particles called corpuscles and theorised that diffraction was due to the particles speeding up as they entered a denser medium, being attracted by gravity. However he has since been proved wrong, now we can measure the speed of light and have proved it to slow down in a denser medium. Albert Einstein thought that light were discrete packets of energy which he called quanta.

==Wave-particle duality==
In 1924, Louis-Victor de Broglie formulated the de Broglie hypothesis, claiming that ''all'' matter has a wave-like nature; he related wavelength, λ (lambda), and momentum, ''p'':

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{h}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a generalization of Einstein's equation above since the momentum of a photon is given by ''p'' = ''E'' / ''c''
where ''c'' is the speed of light in a vacuum, and ''λ'' = ''c'' / ''ν''.

De Broglie's formula was confirmed three years later for electrons (which have a rest-mass) with the observation of electron diffraction in two independent experiments.  At the University of Aberdeen, George Paget Thomson passed a beam of electrons through a thin metal film and observed the predicted interference patterns. At Bell Labs Clinton Joseph Davisson and Lester Halbert Germer guided their beam through a crystalline grid.

__FORCETOC__
This book will encompass theoretical and practical economic developments with respect to a New Zealand context. New Zealand has typically followed orthodox global trends in economics, but has at times diverged from the prevailing economic orthodoxy, leading to its reputation as a &quot;social laboratory of the world&quot;. Seddon's Liberal-Labour social and humanitarian reforms of the 1890s, and the introduction of a state welfare system by the First Labour Government, attracted international attention and commentary. More recently, the neoliberal economic 'revolution' of 1984-1993, some of the most rapid and wide-ranging economic 'structural adjustments' the world has seen, has led to massive social, political, and economic changes, and debate still continues as whether the 'pain' was worth the 'gain'.

Initially this book will only focus on the monetarist/neoliberal, Keynesian, and Marxist interpretations of the pivotal economic changes between 1945-1973, and 1973 to the present. As time permits, I shall add other chapters relevant to the economics of 'the Land of the Long White Cloud'. I enthusiastically welcome contributions and editing to this book - &quot;If you have knowledge, let others light their candle by it.&quot; - Margaret Fuller

== Interpretations of New Zealand's Post-War Economic History ==
New Zealand’s economic fortunes were drastically altered with the onset of the global recession in the mid-1970s, and two stages are clearly discernible. Prior to 1973 the ‘long boom’ was characterised by strong growth, a balance of payments equilibrium (owing to historically auspicious terms of trade), low inflation, rising real wages, and full employment. From 1974 to 2005 New Zealand had problems with ‘stagflation’ (stagnated growth and high inflation), declining profitability, declining real wages, and massively increased levels of unemployment and impoverishment. This chapter will outline the differences in Marxist, Keynesian and monetarist interpretations of the two epochs in New Zealand (NZ) economic history, and will explain why understanding the interpretations is relevant and necessary to appreciating politics and policy-generation in NZ since the mid-1970s.

NZ was not isolated in its economic downturn. Globally, economies were cooling and unemployment was mounting, with the G7 group of countries, between 1950 and 1973, experiencing a drastic drop in growth (5.5 percent to 2.1 percent) and unemployed numbers up to 6.2 percent from 2.1 percent{{ref|Roper-5}}. However, NZ had peculiarities that exacerbated the global trend. Very few countries experienced both the effects of the oil shocks and a persistently deteriorating market for major traditional exports{{ref|Gould-43}}. NZ’s reliance on a narrow range of exports whilst simultaneously being dependent on imports of oil, capital and intermediate inputs left it vulnerable to the whim of international fortunes{{ref|Hawke-204}}. Major demand- and supply-side constraints to agricultural growth also left it susceptible to a decline in terms of trade{{ref|Hawke-58}}. Nonetheless, comparative evidence strongly suggests that regardless of the terms of trade decline, growth rates would still have declined, since NZ shares similar predispositions of development as other advanced capitalist economies since 1945{{ref|Roper-8}}.

Whilst monetarists and Keynesians both broadly agree on the heavy impact and effect of the externals shocks of the 1970s and 80s on the NZ economy{{ref|Roper-6}}, they, and their Marxist counterparts, interpret NZ’s economic history through fundamentally distinctive and conflicting approaches. Areas of contention include the role of state in economic management; the basis of the boom and ensuing collapse; the stability and meaning behind the economic recovery of the last decade; and how the shifting economic environment has affected policy, policy-making, and the state{{ref|Roper-3}}.

== The chapters, in summary ==
=== Monetarism/Neoliberalism ===
{{Main|New Zealand Economics/Monetarism-Neoliberalism}}

Monetarism and neoliberalism are arguably the most important and widespread of modern economic theories. The central assumption of monetarism/neoliberalism is that the smoothly functioning and self-adjusting market economy, unhindered by government, will spontaneously achieve equilibrium with full employment of resources. With Treasury’s faith in the market’s invisible hand, the utterly rational actions of homo economicus, and a tight grasp of the reins of the money supply, they proposed to make New Zealand a lean, mean, wealth-generating machine.

Many of the economic reforms of the 1980s were of a monetarist/neoliberal nature, centred on the belief that New Zealand's bloated economy was holding the country back. Modern proponents assert that the country's contemporary economic growth is resultant of the hard-fought reforms of the 1980s, and that further, as-yet-unrealised benefits will be the result of this period. 

=== Keynesianism ===
{{Main|New Zealand Economics/Keynsianism}}

The central tenets of Keynesian economic thought are the rejection of the neoliberal assumption that market economies are self-regulating and market clearing, and the elevated significance of aggregated demand . Keynes himself put it best, stating, “The system is not self-adjusting and, without purposive direction, it is incapable of translating our actual poverty into potential plenty”. Keynesians refute the assertion that the economic decline of the 1960s and 1970s were a result of Keynesian economic theory, but of poor economic leadership (particularly prime minister Robert Muldoon's 'Think Big' project).

Modern Keynesian supporters claim that the period of stagnation and recession in the 1980s were avoidable and unneccessary. Keynesian adherents believe that as long as the neoliberalism prevails as the orthodox mechanism driving policy, the NZ economy will continue to trail behind the OECD average.

=== Marxist Interpretation ===
{{Main|New Zealand Economics/Marxism}}

The key difference between Marxism and the two previously discussed approaches is that whilst monetarism and Keynesianism diverge over how the economy should be managed, Marxian economic thought considers the independent variables to be endogenous to the economy. Consequently, capitalism’s intrinsic tendency to generate crisis, characterised by growing unemployment and economic stagnation, will render state policy ineffective, regardless of which is chosen. From a Marxist perspective, therefore, exogenous shocks or government action were not considered to be the cause of the post-1973 economic deceleration.

The Marxian law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall is central to this understanding, and the same features responsible for the increase in the general rate of profit were responsible for undermining the long-term rate of profit: the process was internally contradictory. Due to the structural nature of capitalism contemporary Marxists claim that the New Zealand economy will tend towards crises once again.

=== Importance of Understanding These Interpretations ===
{{Main|New Zealand Economics/Importance_Of_Understanding_These_Interpretations}}

It is necessary to understand NZ’s changing economic landscape and its interpretations: not only do they shape our life chances, choices, and experiences, they influence politics and policy-making profoundly. Without an understanding of the collapse, without an empirically-supported interpretation of the resulting economic changes, we are doomed to repeat mistakes made by those before us. Changes in the economic landscape of New Zealand have had colossal effects, and an understanding of these changes - and the theoretical interpretations of them - are integral to understanding a diverse and expansive range of issues relevant to every person – today, and in the future. If we do not continue to analyse and understand what has led our world to be the way it is, future generations may themselves be condemned to repeat our mistakes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* [[/Chronicles of Narnia/]] by C.S. Lewis
: '''C'''(live) '''S'''(taples) '''Lewis''' (1898-1963) &amp;#8722; British author, literary scholar, and Christian apologist. He wrote more than 40 books, the best-known being, [[/The Screwtape Letters/]] (1942). This satire is a masterpiece of diabolical wit and moral wisdom involving a correspondence between two devils, Screwtape, one of the upper echelon in Satan's &quot;Lowerachy,&quot; and his nephew, &quot;Dear Wormwood,&quot; a junior devil with an earthly mission, wherein the human &quot;patient&quot; is under close scrutiny. The Allegory of Love (1936), his major critical work, is a study of love in medieval literature. [[../Famous works of non-fiction/Mere Christianity|Mere Christianity]], an expanded series of 1943 BBC radio chats, is most admired and influential across a wide spectrum of Christians, which may attest to the author's success in accomplishing the aim of restating theology in a way that avoids many controversies. He also wrote a well-known science-fiction trilogy and the Narnia fantasies for children.

Lewis' greatest books may be
#  A little volume called The Great Divorce&amp;mdash;a fantasy re Heaven and Hell
#  Till We Have Faces, his last (and probably best) book, and adaptation of the Greek myth, Cupid and Psyche.  Here Lewis shows just how far he has grown in spiritual wisdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Web Hosting: An Introduction'''

==What is Web Hosting?==
When someone sets up a server and hooks it up to the Internet, the files on the server become accessible over the Internet. Web Hosting is the space on a Web server where you can upload files. If you upload HTML files, you'll have a Web site. If you upload .ZIP files, you'll have a download area. There are a lot of organizations that provide Web hosting.

==What does Web Hosting do?==
Most companies own their own servers these days, but some still pay for Web hosting. Let's say John Doe decides he wants to sell his paintings online. He purchases Web hosting, and sets up a Web site. Jane Doe, on the other hand, wants to set up a forum system. She purchases Web hosting and installs the forums. If you know how, you can make an entire Web site, or put any files you want, online, via your Web hosting.

In addition, over the last few years hundreds of &quot;Web site softwares&quot; have been written that, when installed onto your hosting account, give you an immediate Web site.

When looking for a Web site software, it's important to consider the software license. If you chose to use [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html free software], you will have the advantage of new software releases that are made available free of charge. Commercial, albeit more powerful, alternatives are often available.

==How and Where can I get hosting?==
Web hosting is available in two forms&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; paid and free.

Paid Web hosting has a periodic fee, be it monthly, quarterly or annually, and typically provides considerable amounts of storage space for your files.  Depending on the service, one may get additional support for server-side scripts, Web commerce support, visitor traffic reports, and so on.  If the hosting service has high-speed connections to the Internet and fast server equipment, it may be able to provide access for many thousands of visitors and allow downloading of tens of gigabytes of files, and more, per day.  Technical support is usually available around the clock, by telephone, Web chat or email, allowing the subscriber to resolve most problems in a few minutes, or, at most, in several hours.

Free hosting, on the other hand, typically has severely limited file storage space and low bandwidth provisions. It may be run on equipment that is just as capable as that used by paid hosting services, but it is usually an adjunct to some other business being carried out by the provider.  Your Web pages will be presented to the site visitor along with advertising banners or pop-up advertisements as a way of recovering the cost of providing this free service to you.  Support for server-side scripts may be limited or non-existent, as well as access to many of the basic functions that most Web hosting programs are capable of providing.  Technical support is usually limited, usually by email only, with response times figured in days.  If you are a novice, a free service may be the place to start, as they often provide semi-automated site-building templates and online tutorials.

With the recent drop in monthly fees for Web hosting&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; usually in the range of a few dollars a month for a basic plan&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; it is recommended that one subscribe to decent, commercial hosting service.

Free hosting sites are over-subscribed and would be good for those who do not mind waiting for periods of time for support resolution.

==Reseller vs. Shared==
Reseller accounts allow clients to divide their account and sell or distribute these allocations to other users. For example, if John purchases a 10GB reseller account, he can then sell ten 1GB accounts. Shared hosting refers to the fact that there are usually 100+ people per server&amp;nbsp;— in effect, &quot;sharing&quot; the server.

==Types of hosting control panels==

There are multiple types of hosting control panels available on the market. Each one is specifically designed for a particular operating system and type of web hosting. For example, some control panels are specific to Linux and others are specific to Windows. Some hosting control panels are designed for hosting resellers, while others are designed for shared web hosting or dedicated server hosting.

== Introduction ==

''“Nobody spends somebody else's money as carefully as he spends his own. Nobody uses somebody else's resources as carefully as he uses his own. So if you want efficiency and effectiveness, if you want knowledge to be properly utilized, you have to do it through the means of private property.”''
- Milton Friedman

Monetarism and neoliberalism confidently strut side-by-side through the schools of modern economic thought: the prevailing economic paradigm, the ‘way of the future’ – or so Treasury would have you believe. The central assumption of monetarism/neoliberalism is that the smoothly functioning and self-adjusting market economy, unhindered by government, will spontaneously achieve equilibrium with full employment of resources. With Treasury’s faith in the market’s invisible hand, the utterly rational actions of homo economicus, and a tight grasp of the reins of the money supply, they proposed to make New Zealand (NZ) a lean, mean, wealth-generating machine.


== Monetarist/Neoliberal Interpretation: 1945-1973 ==

Treasury was blunt in its 1984 and 1987 briefing papers to the Fourth Labour Government: “The New Zealand economy continues to display one of the most lacklustre performances among countries in the developed world”{{ref|Treasury-103}}. Whilst it acknowledges the impact of the decline in terms of trade and the global downturn in economic performance on NZ’s economic growth (“When world prices move against us, there is an unavoidable loss of income”{{ref|Treasury-108}}), Treasury clearly lays the blame at the feet of the Muldoon administration (1975 – 1984). The National Government’s management of the economy, its Keynesian-style policies, and its “unwillingness to adjust to changing external conditions”{{ref|Treasury-104}} explained rising unemployment, NZ’s comparative economic deterioration, and soaring inflation.

The monetarist argument for the end of NZ’s economic “golden weather” was simple and clear: economies are assumed to tend to equilibrium and maximise resource utilisation, therefore the state must have interfered in the market’s distribution of resources. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, anathema to monetarists, had generated excessive inflationary pressures, undermining growth, distorting market signals, and reducing the competitiveness of NZ producers by raising (relative to trading partners) their cost structures. These problems were compounded by the pegged nominal exchange rate’s inability to adjust to ease the mounting current account deficit. The National government’s interventionism was ad hoc and inconsistent, rife with excessive regulation, and structural disincentives to excel. Furthermore, misallocation of resources within an overprotected economy, and an inflexible and rigid labour market, increased economic susceptibility to both the exogenous supply shocks of the 1973 and 1979 oil crises, and the collapse of prices for agricultural exports.{{ref|Roper-10}}

Thus, Treasury’s prescription was for the Fourth Labour Government to reject Keynesianism, and to adopt a strong monetarist economic policy framework, with minimal government intervention and emancipation of the market. Integral to the underpinning neoclassical foundation of Treasury’s counsel was the reduction and maintenance of inflation at a diminutive level (initially legislated at 0-2%, currently 1-3%) in order to enable price flexibility, unambiguous market signals, and ultimately, spontaneous economic growth, balance of payments equilibrium and maximised unemployment.{{ref|Treasury-167}} This was strongly supported by the Reserve Bank, who argued that “the control of inflation was among the most important changes required for faster economic growth”.{{ref|Bollard-83}} Other remedies for the economy included reform of the ‘bloated’ public sector, regressive taxation reform to attract investment and provide incentives, and a reduction in the scope of welfare to a limited ‘safety net’ system.


== Monetarist/Neoliberal Interpretation: 1974-2005 ==

Monetarist proponents have proclaimed the increased growth rate and severely reduced inflation since the ‘revolution’ of the mid-1980s to early-1990s to be irrefutable proof and vindication of the neoliberal reform. Treasury’s response, under the apt title, ‘A Sound Economic Position’, states that the contrast between the decline of the pre-1984 epoch and the “current dynamism is largely attributable to the shift in the approach to economic management” and “good policy foundations” .

Whilst the policy regime has attracted praise – notably Evans, Grimes, and Wilkinson – it has also stimulated criticism regarding the costs and outcomes of these policies. Monetarists claim in defence that the reform measures were impeded and ill-sequenced by events outside of their control. Barriers to early labour market reform, to reductions in welfare expenditure, and to the correct sequencing of reforms led to a higher-than-desired ‘sacrifice ratio’ . Furthermore, it has been claimed that not all benefits of the reforms have become manifest, and “the ultimate benefits to output can take a long time to achieve” .

A final defence cited by monetarist apologists is that the reforms are incomplete. Lange’s announcement of “a breather and a cup of tea&quot; obstructed and delayed the necessary reforms : “further reform[s] in…education, health and welfare, are likely to be necessary if New Zealand is to achieve its potential” , and additional labour market liberalisation and tax reductions are essential to greater economic performance .

== Introduction ==

''“When I ask two economists a question I get two different answers, unless one of them is Lord Keynes, in which case I get three.&quot;''
- Sir. Winston Churchill

The central tenets of Keynesian economic thought are the rejection of the neoliberal assumption that market economies are self-regulating and market clearing, and the elevated significance of aggregated demand . Keynes himself put it best, stating, “The system is not self-adjusting and, without purposive direction, it is incapable of translating our actual poverty into potential plenty” .


== Keynesian Interpretation: 1945-1973 ==

Keynesian proponents ardently refute monetarists’ explanation of the pre-1973 period of relative prosperity, and the subsequent stagnation. Monetarists’ critically highlight the substantial per capita GDP decline after 1945, however Gould asserts that this can be attributed to a relatively high population growth rate, and compositional characteristics of the NZ economy .

A central Treasury critique was that Sir Robert Muldoon’s (Prime Minister and Finance Minister, 1975-1984) Keynesian policies had failed, engineering the disintegration of the post-war boom, and that this was unambiguous testimony to the inherent faults of Keynesian demand-management strategies and economic theory. This is stringently contested by Keynesian economists, who claim that whilst fiscal policy was an economic instrument employed by the Third National Government, the administration was “far from being a paragon of Keynesian virtue” .

Whilst Keynes promoted state investment, it had to be accurately employed. Muldoon’s heavy agricultural subsidisation (Supplementary Minimum Price) and ‘Think Big’ energy production scheme were arguably misallocated state funds, in contrast to support for the manufacturing sector (Export Performance Tax Incentives) that were successful in stimulating exports . Internal fiscal deficit did not increase sufficiently during 1975-1984 to stimulate activity in the domestic economy, negating assumptions of neutral fiscal policy based on coincidental stagnation and increasing unemployment . These assumptions also ignore the effect the Reagan administration’s Keynesian policies had on the revival of the US economy . Finally, Muldoon’s unpredictable handling of the economy can be as equally criticised from a Keynesian standpoint as much as a monetarist.


== Keynesian Interpretation: 1974-2005 ==

Empirical evidence illustrates how the reform period brought the NZ economy to its knees. Dalziel notes that if growth had continued at pre-reform rates, the income sacrificed between 1987 and 1992 was “$11 500 per working age person, or 32 percent of annual GDP” . According to Kelsey’s studies, whilst OECD countries experienced 20 percent growth between 1985-92, the NZ economy actually contracted by 1 percent . Although the period 1994-05 achieved higher real GDP growth (3.43 percent) and lower inflation (2.12 percent), growth was still significantly slower than the 1950-74 epoch (3.47 percent) , and is expected to decline from 2006/07 onwards .

The worsening economic situation in the 1980s and 1990s, Keynesians believed, was chiefly due to the neoliberal strategy employed by the Fourth Labour Government. The Reserve Bank was forced to use interest rates and currency devices to ease demand for credit, as they failed to control the M3 money supply in a laissez-faire financial market. The Bank’s attempts to control rising inflation led to increased interest rates and exchange rate, harming productive businesses. The subsequent decline in profits and evaporation of investment lead to a contraction in output, and thus employment. In addition, the economic channels designed to transmit policy and market signals did not effectively communicate authorities messages, damaging much of the NZ economy . The inflexible product and wage markets reacted poorly to monetarist ambitions, and considerable inflation reduction can be attributed to diminishing real output and employment.

A patent differentiation in Keynesian thought is that the long-run trend is merely the aggregate of the short-run, as opposed to monetarism’s assumption that medium-term growth increases would outweigh the short-term slump in employment and growth generated by economic reform . Dalziel and Withwell criticise the monetarists’ disinflationary policies and aims as hysteresic and short-sighted.

For Keynesians, the heavy costs paid by New Zealanders were not worth the resultant mediocre, and possibly temporary, economic growth. Keynesian adherents believe that as long as the neoliberalism prevails as the orthodox mechanism driving policy, the NZ economy will continue to trail behind the OECD average.

== Introduction ==
''“Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth - the soil and the labourer.”''
- Karl Marx

The key difference between Marxism and the two previously discussed approaches is that whilst monetarism and Keynesianism diverge over how the economy should be managed, Marxian economic thought considers the independent variables to be endogenous to the economy. Consequently, capitalism’s intrinsic tendency to generate crisis, characterised by growing unemployment and economic stagnation, will render state policy ineffective, regardless of which is chosen. From a Marxist perspective, therefore, exogenous shocks or government action were not considered to be the cause of the post-1973 economic deceleration.


== Marxist Interpretation: 1945-1973 ==

The principal determinant of economic growth, in Marxian economic theory, is the general level of profitability, as this largely establishes the overall intensity of productive investment. Accordingly, many scholars consider a global crisis of deficient investment and subsequent diminishing profitability as the basis for the prolonged economic slowdown of the NZ economy . The economy’s comparatively poor performance is credited to NZ’s specific economic context in the global economic arena, and the consequent reduction in terms of trade. The Marxian law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (TRPF), “because the organic composition of capital has a tendency to rise faster than the rate of surplus-value” is central to the Marxist interpretation of economics: Marx himself considered it “the most important law of modern political economy” . Strong empirical evidence disproves the criticism that the Marxian TRPF theorem is empirically unfounded and acknowledges that, by both orthodox and Marxian measures, there has been a unambiguous empirical trend of declining general profitability since 1945. This is evident in NZ, where the rate of capital return fell from an average of 16.2 percent (1967-74) to 10.3 percent (1975-84) , and declining agricultural profitability . This cooling of the world economy consequently explains the weakening demand for agricultural commodities.

Three empirical studies that draw upon different sources of data (Pearce, 1986; Cochrane, 1997; Cronin, 2001) confirm the post-war decline in the rate of profit in NZ, supporting the fundamental concept that the declining general rate of profit was the fundamental cause of sluggish economic performance and elevated unemployment. Pearce’s study verifies that the key Marxian aggregates in NZ did correlate with those integral to Marxist theory, and provides a lucid explanation for the post-war boom and the evolution of structural preconditions necessary for the post-1973 prolonged crisis of capital accumulation.

The post-war rise in profit was the consequence of two main elements: the pre-war decline in the organic composition of capital, facilitating an increase in the rate of profit from 9.3 percent to 21.2 percent from 1932 to 1943 ; and the increasing rate of surplus value from 1938 to 1951 caused by strict governmental control of wages, with the compliance of the higher echelons of trade union bureaucracy . The high rate of profit from these combined factors led to increased investment in fixed capital, increased productivity of labour, and an elevated level of economic growth, sustained by technological developments in capital equipment.

Simultaneously, the technological revolution increased labour productivity and rate of surplus value, diminishing capital value. Thus the technological advances, through widespread capitalisation and mechanisation of production, increased the organic composition of capital and counteracted TRPF. Sustained increases in the rate of surplus value were ensured by labour productivity gains exceeding those in real wages . In addition, improvements in communications and transportation, historically high prices for NZ’s agricultural produce, and supportive Keynesian policies helped sustain the high rates of growth .

However, the same features responsible for the increase in the general rate of profit were responsible for undermining the long-term rate of profit: the process was internally contradictory . Whilst initially the increases in the organic composition were offset by those in the rate of surplus value, from the mid-1960s the increases became unbalanced: the rate of surplus value reached an apex, levelled, and, with the major upsurge in class struggle in the late-1960s and early 1970s, began to fall. In addition, post-war allocation of labour to non-productive roles (with respect to surplus value) in the state sector was a drain on aggregate surplus value, and contributed to depressing the rate of profit .

The afore-described account was observed globally, however, and NZ’s precipitous fall was unique amongst similarly developed countries. Other Marxist scholars suggest NZ’s highly efficient pastoral production and its capitalist development in the international division of labour are relevant , whilst others elucidate NZ’s development through the application of the Marxian theory of differential ground rent . Simply explained, it suggests that due to the comparative advantage in agricultural productivity there was a net inflow of surplus money into the NZ economy . When productivity and output growth plateaued in the mid-1960s the flow of differential rent into the economy declined, diminishing the general rate of profit and leading to the comparatively deleterious economic stagnation . Cronin argues that increased direct foreign investment and its corresponding net outflow of investment revenue and surplus value exacerbated this trend.

== Marxist Interpretation: 1974-2005 ==

Marxists tend to agree with Keynesian critiques of neoliberal/monetarist reforms, but disagree that these policies were the principal cause of NZ’s post-1984 economic failings. The sole difference between booms and prolonged capitalist crises (such as that from 1974 to the present) is the magnitude of the cyclical recessions and recoveries. A necessary condition for prolonged high economic growth rates is a sustained increase in the general rate of profit, which is then stimulated and maintained by a wave of investment in fixed capital. This in turn generates qualitative progress in labour productivity and technological development .

The ‘structural adjustments’ since 1984 have successfully increased the rate of surplus value and somewhat devalorised unprofitable fixed capital, thus increasing the general rate of profit , and explain the 1993-96 and 1999-2005 recoveries. However, the vulnerability of these recoveries are emphasised by a lack of evidence that the high profit rates of the 1950s have been re-attained. Thus, the Marxist forecast is for growth and unemployment rates similar to those experienced from 1973 to the present, significantly inferior to those between 1945 and 1973.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot;''
			- George Santayana (1863 - 1952) 

It is necessary to understand NZ’s changing economic landscape and its interpretations: not only do they shape our life chances, choices, and experiences, they influence politics and policy-making profoundly. Without an understanding of the collapse, without an empirically-supported interpretation of the resulting economic changes, we are doomed to repeat mistakes made by those before us.

Keynesian interpretation is used to contrast and critique monetarism, and although official policy debate centres around the choice between monetarism or Keynesian answers, the Marxist interpretation also provides criticism, focusing not only on monetarism’s damaging effects, but also on capitalism’s propensity to generate conflict, inequality, and crises.

To fully appreciate class conflict in NZ, one must understand the economic history. Without comprehension of increasing labour productivity in the 1950s and 1960s, one cannot appreciate the lack of industrial action due to employers’ economic growth ability to increase real wages, coupled with labour shortages. The cessation of rising labour productivity meant real wage increases could only be gained at the cost of declining profit rates . The industrial conflict of the late 1960s and 1970s is therefore intrinsically linked to changing economic conditions.

Similarly, with respect to female participation in paid employment, one must understand the way in which employment conditions have changed to in order to comprehend gender-specific differences in employment and the women’s movement that arose in the 1970s. Likewise, for a thorough understanding of current Maori affairs, one must be aware of the rapid urbanisation of Maori into predominantly-working class occupations caused by labour shortages in the 1950s and 1960s, and the amplified effect, therefore, of the neoliberal reforms.

Interest group activity, the basis of pluralist theory, changed markedly due to economic fortunes. Business associations and trade unions were content with Keynesian economics whilst it served their purposes, but as things soured, business associations heavily pushed a neoliberal agenda. The monetarist hegemony of the higher echelons of policy analysis and development led to the adoption of neoliberal ‘structural adjustments’, and has had a profound impact on policy and policy-generation . Treasury’s ability, along with business associations such as the New Zealand Business Roundtable, to generate and maintain neoliberalism as the prevailing economic school of thought is of concern to political scientists, and the pluralist political orthodoxy.

Changes in the economic landscape of New Zealand have had colossal effects, and an understanding of these changes, and the theoretical interpretations of them, are integral to understanding a diverse and expansive range of issues relevant to every person – today, and in the future. If we do not analyse and understand what has led our world to be what it is, future generations may themselves be condemned to repeat our mistakes.

== Foreword ==
This book covers the basics of Rebol programming, what Rebol actually does and why it's designed the way it is. It's not a reference manual and therefore doesn't contain a complete overview of all functions, but aims to teach the mechanics and principles of the language to give you a deeper understanding of it.

__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
===Guide to readers===
This is a [[w:wikibook|wikibook]], as such you should learn a bit about what it is and how it does its magic.

The book is (or will be) organized into different parts (chapters), but as this is a work that is always evolving, things may be missing or just not where they should be, you are free to become a writer and contribute to fix things up.

===Guide to writers===
All Rebol developers who have interesting information are encouraged to come forward. It does not matter if you are not a stellar writer, as eventually it will be cleaned up.  Although you can post to this book without registering, it is strongly advised that you do so so that we can discuss content which may be contentious.

It is advised at this point to try and keep meanings within the realm of common understanding by the REBOL community.  Anything outside that realm should be stated as such.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Easy to undertake and flexible, box modeling is a favorite of beginners and veterans alike. It is fun to work with and general results are visible in a short time. It is a powerful work flow that any modelers should know.

==Before We Start==

Before doing any modeling, it is vital to plan first. Gather references and make a general plan on how to tackle the modeling phase. Being ready will save you a lot of complications later

==The Work Flow==

With box modeling, start with a primitive that is appropriate for your subject. Most start with a box and generally a good primitive to start. Then, from the primitive, using a variety of tools, mold the essential form of your model. Also called the roughing phase. Don't delve on details here, those are to be tackled later. Finally, on this form, we go to the nearly recursive process of adding details. Layer by layer, details are added until the required amount of detail is achieved.

====Start with a Primitive====

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingIntro_Primitive.jpg|511px]]|2=The Primitive}}

Select the proper primitive for your work. Most modelers start with a cube. The cube is the most flexible primitive available and is suitable to almost all form of subjects. But, in many cases, selecting other form of primitives would cut out most of the modeling required. A gun is a cinch to model using a cylinder. With a little adjustment, a torus forms a good doughnut. In an instant a ball can be made out of a sphere. So produce your primitive to work with.

====Rough It Out====


{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingIntro_Form.jpg|511px]]|2=The Form}}

Take the primitive and start modifying it to capture the essential form of your subject. Tools like extrude, loop cut, scale and grab are very handy for this. Avoid worrying about details at this stage. Those are to be done later.

====Adding Details, Details and more Details====

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingIntro_AddingDetails.jpg|1000px]]|2=Details, details and more detials}}

Now, we approach the most difficult and unquestionably the most fun part. Using a variety of modeling tools, modify the form again to incorporate details. Add details layer by layer, from general to specific. Planning, studying and experience would help you go through. Continue until you achieve the desired level of detail.

Adding details requires subdivision or addition of polygons. The knife and the loop cut tool is handy for subdividing meshes. Extrusion is great for adding details like horns and fingers. Face and edge loop must be herded to other directions at times and warrants a study by itself. Blender provides you with required tools to achieve all of this.

At this stage, beginners and experienced modelers alike will find their meshes getting more and more difficult to work with as the mesh gets a more and more dense at each level of details added. Planning, an eye to the edge flows and experience alleviate this. So plan and keep practicing.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

= Translations =

The page [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/The Sentential Language|The Sentential Language]] gave a very brief look at translation between English and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  We look at this in more detail here.

== English sentential connectives ==

In the following discussion, we will assume the following assignment of English sentences to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; sentence letters:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \, : \,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;2 is a prime number.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \, : \,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;2 is an even number.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R} \, : \,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;3 is an even number.

=== Not ===

The canonical translation of &lt;math&gt;\lnot\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into English is 'it is not the case that'.  Given the assignment above,

: (1) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

translates as 

: It is not the case that 2 is a prime number.

But we usually express negation in English simply by 'not' or by adding the contraction 'n't' to the end of a word.  Thus (1) can also translate either of:

: 2 is not a prime number.
: 2 isn't a prime number.

=== If ===

The canonical translation of &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into English is 'if ... then ...'.  Thus

: (2) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

translates into English as

: (3) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If 2 is a prime number, then 2 is an even number.


Objections have been raised to the canonical translation, and our example may illustrate the problem.  It may seem odd to count (3) as true; however, our semantic rules does indeed count (2) as true (because both &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are true).  We might expect that, if a conditional and its antecedent are true, the consequent is true ''because'' the antecedent is.  Perhaps we expect a general rule

: (4) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; if &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; is a prime number, then &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; is an even number

to be true&amp;mdash;but this rule is clearly false.  In any case, we often expect the truth of the antecedent (if it is indeed true) to be somehow ''relevant'' to the truth of the conclusion (if that is indeed true).  (2) is an exception to the usual relevance of a number being prime to a number being even.

The &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; conditional of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''material conditional'' in contrast to [[w:Strict conditional|strict conditional]] or [[w:Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual conditional]].  [[w:Relevance logic|Relevance logic]] attempts to define a conditional which meets these objections.  See also the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-relevance/ relevance logic].

It is generally accepted today that not all aspects of an expression's linguistic use are part of its linguistic meaning.  Some have suggested that the objections to reading 'if' as a material conditional are based on ''conversational implicature'' and so not based on the meaning of 'if'.  See the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/ implicature] for more information.  As much as a simplifying assumption than anything else, we will adopt this point of view.  We can also point out in our defense that translations need not be exact to be useful.  Even if our simplifying assumption is incorrect, &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is still the closest expression we have in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to 'if'.  It should also be noted that, in mathematical statements and proofs, mathematicians ''always'' use 'if' as a material conditional.  They accept (2) and (3) as translations of each other and do not find it odd to count (3) as true.

'If' can occur at the beginning of the conditional or in the middle.  The 'then' can be missing.  Thus both of the following (in addition to (3)) translate as (2).

: If 2 is a prime number, 2 is an even number.
: 2 is an even number if 2 is a prime number.

=== Implies ===

We do not translate 'implies' into &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, we reject

: 2 is a prime number implies 2 is an even number.

as grammatically ill-formed and therefore not translatable as (2).  See the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Validity#Implication | Implication]] section of [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Validity | Validity]] for more details.

=== Only if ===

The English

: (5) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2 is a prime number only if 2 is an even number

is equivalent to the English

: If 2 is not an even number, then 2 is not a prime number. 

This, in turn, translates into &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as

: (6) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We saw at [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Properties of Sentential Connectives#Conditionals | Conditionals]] section of [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Properties of Sentential Connectives | Properties of Sentential Connectives]] that (6) is equivalent to

: (7) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Many logic books give this as the preferred translation of (5) into &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This allows the convenient rule &lt;nowiki&gt;''if' always introduces an antecedent while 'only if' always introduces a consequent'&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

Like 'if', 'only if' can appear in either the first or middle position of a conditional.  (5) is equivalent to

: Only if 2 is an even number, is 2 a prime number.

=== Provided that ===

'Provided that'&amp;mdash;and similar expressions such as 'given that' and 'assuming that'&amp;mdash;can be use equivalently with 'if'.  Thus each of the following translate into &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as (2).

: 2 is an even number provided that 2 is a prime number.
: 2 is an even number assuming that 2 is a prime number.
: Provided that 2 is a prime number, 2 is an even number.


Prefixing 'provided that' with 'only' works the same as prefixing 'if' with only.  Thus each of the following translate into &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as (6) or (7).

: 2 is a prime number only provided that 2 is an even number.
: 2 is a prime number only assuming that 2 is an even number.
: Only provided that 2 is an even number, is 2 a prime number.

=== Or ===

The canonical translation of &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into English is '[either] ... or ...' (where the 'either' is optional).  Thus

: (8) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

translates into English as

: (9) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2 is a prime number or 2 is an even number

or

: Either 2 is a prime number or 2 is an even number.


We saw at the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility#Interdefinability of connectives | Interdefinability of connectives]] section of [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility | Expressibility]] that (8) is equivalent to

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Just as there were objections to understanding 'if' as &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, there are similar objections to understanding 'or' as &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  We will again make the simplifying assumption that we can ignore these objections.

The English 'or' has both an inclusive and&amp;mdash;perhaps somewhat more controversially&amp;mdash;an exclusive use.  The ''inclusive or'' is true when at least one disjunct is true; the ''exclusive or'' is true when exactly one disjunct is true.  Our &lt;math&gt;\lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt; matches the inclusive use.  The inclusive use becomes especially apparent in negations.  If President Bush promises not to invade Iran or North Korea, not even the best Republican spin doctors will claim he can keep his promise by invading both.  The exclusive reading of (9) translates into &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}) \land \lnot(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or more simply (and less intuitively) as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \lnot\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


In English, telescoping is possible with 'or'.  Thus, (8) translates

: 2 is either a prime number or an even number.

Similarly, 

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

translates

: 2 or 3 is an even number.

=== Unless ===

'Unless' has the same meaning as 'if not'.  Thus

: (10) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

translates

: (11) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2 is a prime number unless 2 is an even number

and

: (12) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Unless 2 is an even number, 2 is a prime number.

We saw at the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility#Interdefinability of connectives | Interdefinability of connectives]] section of [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility | Expressibility]] that (10) is equivalent to (8).  Many logic books give (8) as the preferred translation of (11) or (12) into &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Nor ===

At the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility#Joint denial | Joint denial]] section of [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility | Expressibility]], we temporarily added &lt;math&gt;\downarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as the connective for joint denial.  If we had that connective still available to us, we could translate

: Neither 2 is a prime number nor 2 is an even number

as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \downarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

However, since &lt;math&gt;\downarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is not really in the vocabulary of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, we need to paraphrase.  Either of the following will do:

: (13) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\lnot(\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
: (14) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\lnot\mathrm{P} \land \lnot\mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.


The same telescoping applies as with 'or'.

: 2 is neither a prime number nor an even number

translates into &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as either (13) or (14).  Similarly,

: Neither 2 nor 3 is an even number

translates as either of

: &lt;math&gt;\lnot(\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
: &lt;math&gt;(\lnot\mathrm{Q} \land \lnot\mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

=== And ===

The canonical translation of &lt;math&gt;\land\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into English is '[both] ... and ...' (where the 'both' is optional').  Thus

: (15) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

translates into English as

: 2 is a prime number and 2 is an even number

or

: Both 2 is a prime number and 2 is an even number.


Our translation of 'and' as &lt;math&gt;\land\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is not particularly controversial.  However, 'and' is sometimes used to convey temporal order.  The two sentences

: She got married and got pregnant.
: She got pregnant and got married.

are generally heard rather differently.

'And' has the same telescoping as 'or'.

: 2 is a both prime number and an even number

translates into &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as (15)

: Both 2 and 3 are even numbers

translates as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \land \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

=== If and only if ===

The canonical translation of &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into English is '... if and only if ...'.  Thus

: (16) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

translates into English as

: 2 is a prime number if and only if 2 is an even number.


The English

: (17) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2 is a prime number if and only if 2 is an even number

is a shortened form of

: 2 is a prime number if 2 is an even number, and 2 is a prime number only if 2 is an even number

which translates as

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}) \land (\lnot\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot\mathrm{P}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or more perspicaciously as the equivalent formula

: (18) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

We saw at the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility#Interdefinability of connectives | Interdefinability of connectives]] section of [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Expressibility | Expressibility]] that (18) is equivalent to (16).  Issues concerning the material versus non-material interpretations of 'if' apply to 'if and only if' as well.

=== Iff ===

Mathematicians and sometimes others use 'iff' as an abbreviated form of 'if and only if'.  So

: 2 is a prime number iff 2 is an even number

abbreviates (17) and translates as (16).

Thanks for catching 81.42.156.202's edits. I was reverting the Beating Season vandalism and it looks like that got lost in the reverting as well. For the record I leave anonymous votes and comments, because they can be useful. The admin in determining the vote can choose to weigh the votes differently anyway.

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:47, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

==Vandalism==

Could you do a favor for me? I need an administrator to delete part of the history of [[The Computer Revolution]]. Someone vandalised this page and the vandalism has been reverted, but they also vandalised the edit summary, so every time I look at the history of this article I see the word ____ written over and over again. I understand if you don't want to do it, you might not want to if you don't want to look at words like that. Thank you! --[[User:24.71.223.148|24.71.223.148]] 03:38, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

== WCI 2011 : Accelerating Wikibooks : Would like to discuss! ==


Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:20, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]</text>

[[User:217.137.110.30|217.137.110.30]] 20:17, 6 November 2005 (UTC):'''Keep''': How could you delete this, everyone has a right to free speech, Deleting it is like taking away someones righ to free speech, I think it should stay. (JMiller)

[[User:65.96.171.165|65.96.171.165]] added VfD tag, but not a write up here. Next [[User:38.112.6.122|38.112.6.122]] changed it to a speedy deletion tag with only the justification, ''content serves no legitimate purpose'' (whatever legitimate means), which I have just reverted back to the VfD. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:50, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

See my comments on [[/The Manual of Crime/]] for my opinion on this kind of thing. [[User:Geocachernemesis|Geo.]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geocachernemesis|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:50, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - There's no real direction this book could go. The list currently reads like ideas that would come to your head after, say, 40 minutes of thought. They are not even practical enough to be useful. At least The Manual of Crime has enough content to become a real book project, despite my opinion that it's not appropriate for our nice little book project we have going here. But I just don't see this one becoming much of anything. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:15, 27 August 2005 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - The book is an interesting read and deleting the book is nothing short of censorship. The argument supplied of &quot;spray painting a church group's wall&quot; has two issues. (1) It assumes the person is in a church group. (2) More importantly, the spray painting would be blatant defacement with meaningless drivel. This book is neither defacement nor meaningless drivel. The arguments against this thus run as follows. (1) This book is an ethical violation. (2) People should remain [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Rational_Ignorance rationally ignorant]. To (1), I respond that ethics are particular to people and deleting this for the sake of enforcement of your view of ethics on other people is censorship. I do not believe that you should tell other people what their ethics should be or force them to conform to your views (meaning they disagree but have no more choice). I realize this is a performative contradiction (ie. by posting this I am quasi-violating the latter because I am attempting to force people to conform to my standard of no censorship, which is a form of censorship because it censors censorship). If wikibooks supports free speech, then its policy should prohibit censorship, excepting the case of censoring censorship.  To (2), I respond that there are a lot of things you would likely prefer to remain rationally ignorant of; however, that does not warrent their deletion either. --[[User:Caudax|Caudax]] 09:03, 05 September 2005 (GMT)

First, the idea that cheating a testing system can never serve a legitimate purpose assumes that all testing authorities are good and right, when in fact we know that testing methodology is widely and deeply flawed, and not all test results are used for humane or just purposes. Cheating is basically a form of hacking a system, which I'm going to assume Wikibiblians will recognize as not a black-and-white issue, not least because this book could teach teachers how to spot  it (and might  get them to change some of their more flawed testing methodology). Second, anyone who thinks a book-length work on cheating is impossible has never read a book on the theory and practice of magic/prestidigitation. Trust me, it's more than possible. You could write a book on the different kinds and applications of cheat-sheet alone.

** &quot;keep everything&quot; someone obviously put a lot of time and energey into makeing a coherent and reletivly complete guide to academic cheating.  For their effort and considering the nature of an open wiki like this, i think it would be immature and overly judgemental of anyone to think that a section on cheating is morally unethical.  Besides, cheating only really hurts the cheater and the test.  Keep it, because freedom of information is a good thing. (btw i dont think anyone who is seriously planning on cheating is going to read the guide to figure out how to do it)

I put the following reply on the talk page for this book and I felt it should also go here as well:
:For the record, this book reads very far from what a book on &quot;How to Prevent Cheating&quot; would look like. Just the same way that the Manual of Crime reads nothing like what &quot;A Guide to Home Security&quot; would be. So don't even pretend these &quot;helping out the victim&quot; arguments is somehow a key goal of these books, or that they're even good resources.&lt;p&gt;Most cheaters and most criminals get caught eventually. There is nothing amazing about their techniques, because in the long run they get caught (even Blane Nordahl did). The only thing of note about these activities is the harm it does to their victims.

*:There's a huge difference between editorialship and censorship. Censoring is suppressing the publication or distribution of ''other people's'' or organizations' works. Editing is deciding what you ''yourself'' want to publish. People are free to get their own servers, install MediaWiki, and publish what they want: WikiBooks can't stop them, because we have no censorship powers. Further, we've also set a long precedent of deleting more than just works with &quot;outstanding circumstances.&quot; We've also deleted drivel, nonsense, off-topic books, original research, political group projects, and even works that just weren't going anywhere. It simply would not be fair to the many contributors to WikiBooks who write wonderful introductory texts to suddenly ruin the reputation of WikiBooks simply because we misunderstand what the word &quot;censorship&quot; means. Provided we only control what's on our own servers we are merely ''editors''. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:20, 31 August 2005 (UTC)
:: This is an instance of both censorship and editorialship, by your own definitions. Wikibooks can be considered both a distributor and an author. To the extent that it is the former, it is censorship; and the latter, editorialship. Further, I said nothing about those other concerns (nonsense, original research, etc), since they weren't directly relevant; of course those are legitimate reasons for censoring. Just don't kid yourself about what the word means. [[User:Lucidish|Lucidish]] 16:55, 31 August 2005 (UTC)
::: If you're at your church group, and you say that you want to spray paint on the side of the building &quot;All Your Base Are Belong To Us,&quot; but the group says no, is that censorship? There's a point where using that label simply isn't helpful. I'm not concerned with the consequences of passersby reading &quot;All Your Base Are Belong To Us&quot; and the negligible or real impact that will have on their lives. I'm concerned about the church group's right to do with their property as they please. By throwing the word censorship around it completely ignores the rights of the group. Instead of throwing labels around we should try to reach consensus. Although we have ethical obligations we should be concerned more about what it is we want to create and express on this site than how better or worse we're making the world. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 17:28, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
:::: As part of the Wiki group, I do not think a) the relevant material crosses a threshold where the rights of others are violated, or b) the material was posted in bad faith (as in vandalism etc).  That analogy does not apply. The rights of the group are not being called into question.
:::: All moral intuitions have to do with consequences. If you truly eliminate that from consideration, given the above, then really your argument hasn't got any force behind it. Moreover, censorship is a decision that ought not be taken lightly -- it is a consideration that has weight. In my judgment, enough weight to spare this entry.

::::: I don't necessarily agree with Mshonle, but you are misunderstanding his analogy. He's specifically asking about good faith contributions to a group (and their &quot;property&quot; -- quotes since we're talking about bits...) and whether the group has the power/right/responsibility to define their goals and therefore what happens on their &quot;property&quot;. He is arguing that the goal of wikibooks does not include this module, that removing it is not censorship because the group never consented to its existence in the first place (since it would not have met the criteria for something following their goals) and therefore that it is the right of the group to remove it. So the argument he is making is less about harm and rights being violated than the granting of permission based on some form of collective control/ownership.

:This censorship point is moot, since deleting this book would be an act of censorship. But who cares? The underlying argument is actually a matter of free speech, whether wikibooks is actually free enough to host this sort of material. Basically, there are two reasons that I can think of to keep this book

#&quot;Wikibooks is made for distributing information for free. This is information, so keep it! Censoring it is a violation of free speech!&quot;
#&quot;This book could have some redeeming value. Instructors can use it to find information on how people can cheat and stop them!&quot;

:As we know, free speech has its limits and restrictions. You can't say just anything you want and claim protection under free speech. So then, the free speech issue actually boils down to whether or not this book is actually protected under free speech and the wikipedia/books philosophy, or whether the subject matter is inappropriate. So then, we must ask, what positive good can this book do? What redeeming value does it have, if any, to protect it under free speech or the wiki philosophy?

:On the one hand, it can help instructors.
:On the other, it can help cheaters.

:The two possible ways in which it can 'help' both oppose each other. It helps the cheaters just as much as the teachers. So then, why have it at all when all it really does it support two conflicting goals? 

:There are three possible scenarios.

#Student A cheats, Teacher B catches cheater thanks to this wikibook (yay!).
#Student A cheats, Teacher B never read this wikibook, cheater gets away.
#Student A doesn't cheat, Teacher B read this book and is prepared, but it doesn't matter since the student is acting ethically (yay!).

:So then, we can see that this book &lt;b&gt;actually&lt;/b&gt; hurts more than it helps, because in the second scenario, it doesn't help the teacher since the teacher didn't read this book, but the cheater did. So actually, this book is only good for the first scenario, but not for any other scenario.

:But then, there is always the third reason to keep this book

:3. For the hell of it.

:I don't think I need to argue against that point. I think I've explained enough; this wikibook should be deleted. --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 16:18, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
:: An interesting analysis, but you seem to have misinterpreted your own scenario. The outcome is positive overall: option (1) is positive, (2) is negative, (3) is positive. And anyway, the point of providing this wiki is that the teacher can know of it if they wished to. It is not reasonable to expect people to control actual outcomes, only to facilitate good ones as best they can. [[User:Lucidish|Lucidish]] 18:30, 1 September 2005 (UTC)
:::Not quite. (3) actually is neutral, since this wikibook would have no impact on the situation. Scenario 2 is what breaks the deal, since now wikibooks is contributing directly to that student getting away with cheating (by detailing subtle or 'sophisticated' ways of cheating). If there was a way to make this wikibook only available to teachers than this would be a valid book to have on wikibooks, but as-is it does more harm than good. --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 01:48, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

First, I am saying that it is the proponents of the deletion who are seeking to enforce their views of ethics. For instance, you view it unethical for wikibooks to host books that give tips on cheating; therefore, you wish the book to be deleted to coincide with your views on what is ethical or not. Thus, you are attempting to enforce your views of ethics upon the wikibooks community. You then state &quot;Wow, what a learning experience.&quot; This comment coincides with &quot;enforcing rational ignorance&quot; as you are saying that people should rationally remain ignorant of the topic. Whether or not to remain rationally ignorant of a subject is for the potential reader to decide, not another person. I am sure there are a great deal of topics you would rather remain rationally ignorant on; however, that does not mean everyone else should too.

:::::::Really? I guess I don't have any right to vote then. I must have been confused.

:::::::Under what conditions should Wikibooks keep a book then? What qualifies this wikibook as proper wikibook material? Simply because somebody posted it here? Or are you saying there is something legitimate to be learned from this wikibook? I have already dealt with the usefulness of this wikibook as a guide for teachers, and it lacks quite a bit for that use.

:::::::I think perhaps now would be a good chance for you to give us some good reasons to keep this book, besides the whole censorship issue (since I agree this would be censorship, but proper censorship). Just some pleasure learning for those curious as to how to cheat?
::::::::Your cynisism amuses me as little as my words have amused you. If you believe that what I have stated constitutes that you have no right to vote, then you have conceded that this is solely a matter of whether or not you would have people learn this, in which case I stand by my words; you do not have the right to determine for other people. (Ergo, no, you don't have the right to vote in favor of deletion.) In my opinion (yes I grant it is but an opinion, but so is yours), a wikibook should be kept if it is not defacement or meaningless drivel. The book does not lack anything to aid teachers. Your argument that it is too lacking for teachers is nonexistant; you but argued that it is more likely that a student would abuse it than that a teacher would be able to properly use it. A teacher could certainly use this tool to discern the techniques students use for cheating, even if this guide does not bluntly explain for the teacher how to do it. Furthermore, most prescription medicines [http://businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_36/b3949001_mz001.htm have been discovered to be ineffective for the majority of the users], who are inclined to suffer from side-effects instead of acquiring the desired results.

:::::::::I find it ironic that you would disenfranchise me to prevent a case of censorship.

:::::::::This is not a case of life or death or bad health (in which case, one may take the risks associated with drugs), this is a case of encouraging cheating. Your basic premise is, &quot;this isn't a defacement or meaningless drivel, so let's keep it.&quot; You merely tried to downplay the potential consequences of leaving this book on wikibooks. Wikibooks' policy disagrees with your premise; wikibooks isn't suppose to be everything to everybody.

:::::::::Your example is flawed. Everybody that takes prescription drugs [normally] has an illness to cure. Drugs normally don't give you the illness you're trying to get rid of or prevent. Keeping this wikibook up is like letting anybody take a drug that can cure their illness, or even cause it (for those who don't have the illness), without permission or supervision. In the end, leaving this drug up will likely cause more people to become sick than to be cured, and in the end more sick then cured people will result. Those people that want the drug to cure an illness can just as easily treat themselves using herbal remedies (learn/think up ways to cheat), thereby going around the drug altogether. --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 15:59, 14 September 2005 (UTC)
::::::::::About &quot;leaving this drug up,&quot; I have already explained how the situation is identical (in that regard) to prescription drugs. Drugs have been known to give you worse illnesses than the ones you are trying to get rid of or prevent. Unless I'm very much mistaken, by the way, over-the-counter drugs have been proven to be worse than prescription drugs (ie. a drug anybody can take). Also, teachers would have the illness of &quot;cheaters&quot; to &quot;cure.&quot; I do not see how my example is flawed.

::::::::::As for downplaying the consequences of leaving this book on wikibooks, I did no such thing; I merely refrained from commenting on the blatantly obvious because it is blatently obvious. There's no point in commenting on that. I have never once disagreed that this book will aid cheaters and that there will be an increased amount of cheaters. However, as you apparently have desires to turn this point into a discussion point, I would like to comment that as wikibooks has been a ''learning source'' and as such is more likely to attract readers interested in the pursuit of knowledge than readers interested in beating the system. Furthermore, when it comes to downplaying the consequences of leaving this book on wikibooks, you have done exactly that with the effects such as teachers learning more about how cheaters cheat (and such knowledge is commonly extremely limited) and how other readers might also wish to read this out of curiosity without making abusive use of it.

::::::::::As for whether or not to encourage cheaters, you'll find that an audience that would be tempted by this is rediculously smaller with the general wikibook audience. As for wikibooks policy, feel free to link it and then I'll discuss it. I'm not going to discuss a system I'm not sure how it works because I wont really know what I'm saying and that would accomplish nothing. As for disenfranchising you in the name of prohibiting censorship, I have already explained how the only thing I would have censored would be censorship itself. Anti-censorship has always been an ironic concept. --[[User:Caudax|Caudax]] 01:03, 17 September 2005 (GMT)

===Further thoughts===
Is there any interest from the contributors of this book to change the title to &quot;A Teacher's Guide to Finding Cheaters&quot; and rewriting it to present similar information, but always from that perspective? Also, would there be any objections? I think I may &lt;s&gt;strike out&lt;/s&gt; my previous statement and vote, because I'm convinced now there is at least a chance a text from this angle could evolve into something constructive that could amount to something. (My vote on record was concerned with how the book could even be developed. An extended list of other things to write, that would provide direction, could help address this concern.)&lt;p&gt;Naturally, people looking to cheat could &quot;read between the lines&quot; and figure out the same material anyway. That's one reason I'm trying to avoid any arguments along the lines of &quot;but if we do this, this bad thing will happen&quot; or &quot;but if we don't do this, this good thing won't happen.&quot; This fails because there can be a lot of unintended positive results, and a lot of unintended negative results. For example, for all we know a book on biology might start an argument between a teenager and their parents which might cause the teenager to run away from home. We'd never hold the biology textbook authors (to just use this hypothetical example) accountable for that. The biology textbook author's sole responsibility is to develop books suitable for coursework.&lt;p&gt;Of course, we do have ethical obligations as well, which can override some of these rules, but the topic at hand is sufficiently G-rated to not raise much concern (afterall, don't we remember that episode of the Wonder Years where Kevin cheats?). So, to me, I'm now more concerned with the community goals. I still maintain WikiBooks is primarily a source for textbooks. The cookbook is allowed, because there are courses on cooking. (I also think the Poker and Chess books should be allowed, because there are international organizations and competitions centered around these, and their own libraries would have How-To books similar to what these books can become.) But the further away from this common goal we get, and the darker the territory, the less fair it is to people who didn't want to see the project get moved in that direction.&lt;p&gt;I'd also recommend we hold off on the previous ideas of merging with the Manual of Crime, given now that that book is likely to go, and it wouldn't be fair to delete this book indirectly that way. If we are to delete the cheater's guide we'll need fair reasons for doing so. If we can work together and make the book a Teacher's guide I would see less reason to delete, if any at all. However, I do have concerns about the &quot;original work&quot; nature currently reflected; for example, the section on Karma doesn't seem like it was actually constructed from a primary and secondary source to see what teachers feel about cheating. I think you'd find that teachers at schools that hand out degrees to be equally disturbed by the capacity that cheating lowers the quality of the degree for everyone else. (And thus it is not a victimless &quot;crime&quot; nor one where you &quot;are only hurting yourself&quot;.) Perhaps a new introduction could start with that. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:09, 1 September 2005 (UTC)

:I doubt that this book will amount to anything more than a guide for cheaters. It was never meant to be so, it was meant as an aid to cheaters, not teachers. The authors of and contributors to the book have shown no desire to make it an instructive guide for teachers. Unless they relinquish their desire to make a guide for cheaters (their original intention) and decide on making a guide suitable for teachers (the opposite intention; they don't want to empower teachers, they want to empower cheaters), there will be no way for such a venture to be accomplished.

:You say that we can never know the side effects of a person reading the books on wikibooks. I agree; however, your example doesn't work, since nobody would ever expect anything of that nature to come about. There is no way to even predict that would happen. With a book named 'A guide to cheating during tests and examinations' detailing all the different ways to cheat, how could we NOT predict that the book could be used for bad rather than good?

:What does it mean to be 'fair' about deleting this book, directly or indirectly? If you mean according to wikibook policies, then I agree, but if we're being 'fair' for the sake of being 'fair' then I think logic has left the building.

:One more thing. At the top of the article in the big red box it says, &quot;Disclaimer: All of the below material is for research purposes only...&quot; I thought wikibooks wasn't meant for original research? --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 12:32, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

::By fair I just meant that if it were to be deleted, it would be good for us to have a solid reason. All I'm worried about is that I have some doubts in my mind about the reason I first used. No doubt more books like this will come up, so it would be best to have a solid precedence to turn to.&lt;p&gt;I think this leaves other issues for the book, which I think would be legitimate reasons to delete, although some of them could be addressed: (1) The book is original research-- for something that isn't orthodox it should reference scholarly work. I say orthodox because a book, say, in orthodox Economics, the laws of supply and demand are so well agreed upon by each and every textbook that in order to funish sources you just need to name any textbook. (2) The book is probably not valid-- As a result of the first problem there's no way to know if any of the techniques have the desired effect, or if there are real world barriers for them to work. (3) The book is not a suitable instructional resource-- while you can learn from any book that even demonstrates only half-truths, the goal of wikibooks is not to try to cover each and every thing. Simply &quot;being true&quot; is not enough grounds to secure a book's place in Wikibooks. Just like how we don't have books on &quot;That time the worm got into the Pepsi can and what everybody said about it.&quot; While it is necessary for an autodidact to read and understand a book on his own, to be successful an autodidact also needs to read the ''right'' books. That's part of the value we create here. And (4) The book is slanted in favor of cheaters and promoting cheating. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 14:28, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

:::Agreed, this book has all the makings of being inappropriate for wikibooks and wikimedia as a whole. If the contributors to this book want to promote cheating, they should find another venue to do so in. --[[User:Mijokijo|Mijokijo]] 14:58, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

I think the text has the potential to be a good book. I think that it might be a great little text for a stressed out student to happen upon during exam week--you know, for the laughs. It's a perfect juxtaposition--textbook style that simultaneously undermines that which it is based upon. Philosophical questions could be asked: &quot;Would cheating on your Cheating 101 test be ethical?&quot; 

It makes no sense to categorize this &quot;Crime&quot; as these acts are not illegal per se--merely against the rules. What must be weighed here is the validity of a free and open society. People are cheating out there every day. People are breaking the rules. You can repress this information, and thus undermine the open sprit of Wiki or you can embrace the fact that the essence of cheating is &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;, regarding rules as merely rules, NOT laws. If it weren't for people breaking the rules (or at least THINKING and WRITING about breaking the rules) there wouldn't be a Wikipedia or Wikibooks. There would be Microsoft Expedia and the information that Microsoft Corporation wants you to know would be all there is to know. Coming up with new ways to buck the system is a pastime of the extremely intelligent and extremely bored. It stimulates creativity like no other motivator. Read the article again and ask yourself if it's creative. Can this be a book? Yes. Can this serve a purpose? Yes. Look at the wonderful debate and conversation it's already stimulated!

*:That's not exactly true. I've suggested several times that a book about conducting examinations (from the teacher's perspective) would be appropriate. There are so many ways teachers can design exams that most of these &quot;tips&quot; are rendered useless. For example, printing out different versions of the test and passing them out so no two people next to each other have the same test. Also, forbidding students to wear hats with bills on them, unless the bill is turned around backwards (because they can write cheat sheets on them). Additionally, asking for student IDs when the exams are turned in, to match face with name. Most of the worthwhile content of this book could be rewritten in a more appropriate format, in addition to providing sections for teachers to beat cheaters. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 17:25, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

: &quot;Merge&quot; can be understood as a variety of &quot;Keep&quot;. That would be four to three and a half. I'm no admin, but that's not a consensus. [[User:Lucidish|Lucidish]]
::For what it's worth the merge vote is arguing to put it into a book that will be deleted. That is ''not'' the same as a keep. I read that more as &quot;assign my vote to what the result of that vote is&quot;. But who am I to presume what they really meant? That's why I counted it separately. Beyond that issue, consensus does not mean &quot;unanimous&quot;. It's the wording and the arugments brought forth that carry the weight, not raw vote counting. For example, suppose something controversial was up for deletion and three known contributors with high community reputations brought forth many well-reasoned arguments to keep, while a dozen poorly-argued and anonymous IPs and sock puppets made insults and voted to delete. Consensus can only be determined from the reasonable members in the discussion, so in this scenario that &quot;vote&quot; might very well result in a keep. It's not the best process around, but it's what we have. There are discussions about changing the way books are voted for deletion. But just using common sense and seeing the diversity of the community that wants to see this book deleted I think it's pretty clear we don't want this book to be part of our project. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:19, 10 September 2005 (UTC)
::: Of course consensus doesn't mean &quot;unanimity&quot;. But neither does it simply mean mean &quot;a majority&quot;, or -- as in this case -- &quot;a very slight majority&quot;. Again, it seems obvious to me that &quot;merge&quot; is a variety of &quot;keep&quot;; yet another place we part ways. 
:::Also: plenty of arguments have been presented in defence of keeping the article or merging it. And the Wikipedia ethic says nothing at all about this ad hoc criterion of &quot;known contributors with high community reputations&quot;. Unless I've gravely misunderstood the purpose of Wikimedia, all votes count equally. I will operate under that assumption until I hear otherwise from the administration of Wikimedia itself. As before in the discussion on censorship, none of the points you raise about sock puppets etc have any bearing on this particular case, or even abstractly on the notion of giving weight to legitimate members.
::: It is not clear that this page ought to be deleted. Rather, it is obvious that there are diverging opinions. The evidence speaks quite plainly to that. A deletion at this time would be by fiat. [[User:Lucidish|Lucidish]] 20:51, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

::That's not quite accurate. For example, Jimbo in [http://webcast.oii.ox.ac.uk/?view=Webcast&amp;ID=20050711_76 this video] clearly says that all votes are not equal. (Jimbo is the founder of Wikimedia.) The whole video is well worth watching! --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:58, 19 September 2005 (UTC)
:I think the text has the potential to be a good book. I think that it might be a great little text for a stressed out student to happen upon during exam week--you know, for the laughs. It's a perfect juxtaposition--scholarly text style that simultaneously undermines that which it is based upon. Philosophical questions could be asked: &quot;Would cheating on your Cheating 101 test be ethical?&quot; It makes no sense to categorize this &quot;Crime&quot; as these acts are not illegal per se--merely against the rules. What must be weighed here is the validity of a free and open society.  People are cheating out there. Every day. You can repress this information, and thus undermine the sprit of Wiki or you can take the very slight risk that some idiot will read the book, interpret the text as serious and utilize it's methods and then suffer some publically embarassing consequences which could undermine the public perception of Wiki. In the end, the argument really is much more simple: can this be a book? Yes.

==I don't know where votes go anymore==
But here's mine: '''Delete'''. This is not a textbook, nor ever will be. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:28, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Softbody functions:cloth ==

Foreword:
This is basically a text rendition of tuxbot's excellent video tutorial about softbodys in Blender. I wrote this without tuxbot's permission (there was no contact link at the site I found), and I wrote this because the tutorial that was here originally was not only terrible, but incomplete. I found tuxbot's tutorial by googling for 'blender softbody tutorial', no quotes. I will do basically the same things as tuxbot here, but slightly different. I recommend watching his tutorial and making a comparison if you have the time and patience. This tutorial should be usable by someone who has been using blender for maybe a few days, and knows how to navigate the blender UI. If you are not familiar with blender's UI, go to blender.org and read the UI tutorials.

What we are going to do is create a plane and use softbodies to animate it like it was a piece of cloth. Start off with a new file (press ctrl+x and confirm), and if your default scene is not similar to the original default scene, I recommend pressing shift+c to get your cursor and view centered.

Let's create a plane, Press:
   The space bar (while the cursor is in the 3D view, of course) -&gt; Add -&gt; Mesh -&gt; Plane.

Then, to make everything nice and straight, I like to press the following keys in this order:
   A key, tab key, alt+r, confirm.

I recommend doing this anytime you create an object while your view is not set to top view (numpad 7 key). I '''strongly''' recommend doing this if you ever create an armature, because if you do not, it can really screw you up later.

Now we will go back into edit mode, select all and subdivide the mesh twice:
   tab key, A key, W key -&gt; Subdivide, W key -&gt; Subdivide.

Your scene should look something like this (different colors though, most likely):
[[Image:http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/9275/softbody1ee1.png]]

Now we will create a vertex group. A vertex group is basically a list of vertices belonging to a mesh, that other features in blender can make use of. For example, bones in blender can be used to move the vertices of a mesh that belong to a specific vertex group. In the same way, the softbody effect can only be used on the verts that belong to a specific group. 

You should be in '''Edit Mode''' and have all vertices selected. In the '''Link and Materials''' box of the '''Editing Buttons''', click &quot;New&quot;. Now change the word &quot;Group&quot;, that appears, to &quot;SoftbodyGroup&quot;. In the box immediately bellow it, change the weight value to 0.000. Now press the &quot;Assign&quot; button.

Now select any two corner vertices, as long as they are on the same side of the grid mesh.

Click &quot;New&quot; to create a different vertex group for these two vertices.  You can give it any name you prefer.  Then, change the weight value to 1.000 and press the &quot;Assign&quot; button. What we have just done is set these two vertices to be static, or immobile. Like the corners of a flag that would be attached to a flag pole.

Now we are going to set up a cube for this cloth to fall on. I'm going to leave edit mode and move my grid along the positive Z axis.
Press:
   A key, A key, G key, Z key, type 1, Enter key, tab key.
   space bar -&gt; Add -&gt; Mesh -&gt; Cube, tab key, alt+r, confirm, tab key, S key, type 0.25, Enter key, tab key.

Now make sure the plane is selected. In the Mesh box of the '''Editing Buttons''', press the &quot;SubSurf&quot; button, and in the '''Link and Materials''' box press the &quot;Set Smooth&quot; button. I'm going to go to the '''Softbody''' box (it will probably appear as a tab in one of the boxes) in the '''Object Buttons'''. I'm going to click on the double arrow button next to the &quot;Use Goal&quot; button, and I'm going to select the only option that appears; &quot;SoftbodyGroup&quot;. I'm going to change the gravity value to 10.000 (tuxbot uses 9.9 or 9.8, I just picked 10.0). An &quot;E Stiff&quot; value of 0 will make edges stretch almost to infinity, which is ''not'' what we want. Change &quot;E Stiff&quot; to 0.9.

If you press alt+a now, you will see your grid swing around, but it will pass right through the cube.  In order to RENDER the animation, press the &quot;Bake settings&quot; button on the Softbody tab, then press &quot;Bake.&quot; 

Select the cube and go to the '''Object Buttons''' (F7). In the &quot;Particle Interaction&quot; box (it will probably appear as a tab, so you will probably just see &quot;Particle&quot;), activate the &quot;Deflection&quot; button, and set the damping value to 1.000. Now when you run the animation, you should see the grid hit the cube, but it does not look very good.

If you go into edit mode on the plane, select all and subdivide a couple more times, your collision will look a little better, but it will take longer to compute. Also, because we have already set up our vertex group and you are adding more vertices, you will want to reassign the weight values. After subdividing (with every vert selected), set weight to 0.0 and press the &quot;Assign&quot; button. Then select the same two corners you have been using, change the weight value to 1.0, and press &quot;Assign&quot; again. Then alt+a to check it out.
It's better, but it's not great. That's as far as I'm going to cover for now. tuxbot covers wind forces in the video, so you will probably want to check that out.

      <comment>/* Switching and killing programs */ fixed a typo</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a few important keystrokes that are good to remember while using Ratpoison. When you have started your console window, why stop there? It is time to learn how to execute any program, and to switch between these in an effective manner

==Switching and killing programs==
Assuming that you have your console still running (if not, do C-t c), you can execute programs from within that window, just like any other window manager. Again, the difference is that there are no borders and that you cannot switch between these programs with your mouse. Type &quot;xclock&quot; if you are out of ideas about which program to start.
Now, to change back to the console window you press C-t n. N of course means next, so you probably already guessed that C-t p moves to the previous window. Now, the difference between &quot;next&quot; and &quot;previous&quot; is non-existant if you are running only two programs, but as you run more and more programs simulataneously, it becomes ever more useful to be able to move &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;backward&quot; in some sense.

Now, how do you close a program? A number of programs have their own kill bindings (ex. C-x C-c for Emacs, C-w for Firefox and Xchat etc.) but ratpoison provides one command guaranteed to close and kill all running programs: the C-t k salute. The k stands for '''k'''ill, and is implemented much the same way as clicking on the &quot;close&quot; button mainstream window managers provide.

==Handling many programs==
Now, if you've got a multitude of programs running, it is tiresome to repetitively type C-t n enough times to get to the proper program when you need it. C-t &lt;number&gt; switches to program number &lt;number&gt;. Keep in mind that this list is zero-indexed and sorted chronologically- the first program begun is accessed via C-t '''0''', not 1.

Also, you can use C-t &lt;space&gt; instead of C-t n to move to the next program. If you want to do a quick alt tab-like (that is, switch to last program accessed) command, C-t C-t will do that.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Wise Mind: Experiencing Integration &amp; Intuition''' is a concept in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). It assumes that you are capable of experiencing wisdom in your life or &quot;Wise Mind.&quot; You will develop Wise Mind as you learn and practice DBT skills. Skills are learned abilities. With skills, you are able to change behaviors, emotions, and thinking patterns associated with problems in living, especially those causing misery and distress. The specific DBT skills for developing Wise Mind are interpersonal effectiveness skills, emotion regulation skills, distress tolerance skills, and core mindfulness skills.

Many people are familiar with the serenity prayer:

:&quot;God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change;&lt;br&gt; courage to change the things I can;&lt;br&gt; and wisdom to know the difference.&quot;

DBT seeks to help you learn acceptance and change skills. The DBT acceptance skills are core mindfulness and distress tolerance which develop serenity and equanimity. The DBT change skills are emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness which develop courage and self-control.

To understand Wise Mind, you need to understand two states of mind: reasonable mind and emotion mind.

==Reasonable mind==

Facts and common sense are the framework of reasonable mind. You are in reasonable mind when you think logically and rationally. This intellectual or scientific state of mind defines reality in terms of facts, numbers, equations, or cause and effect. Whether balancing your checkbook, baking a cake or working a crossword puzzle, you need the knowledge of reasonable mind.

Reasonable mind is important to learning skills. You need to understand how a skill works and when to apply it. Reasonable mind is a storehouse of information, helping you define a problem objectively and determine a solution. To use skills, you need to know what the different skills are, and how to call them forth when you need them. For example, to regulate emotions skillfully, you must be able to name them, understand what events and interpretations prompt certain emotions, know what emotions feel like, what emotions compel you to do, and their aftereffects. The more you know and the more you practice the stronger reasonable mind becomes.

Reasonable mind is much easier when you are healthy, strong, sober, rested and fed but much harder when you are sick, weak, stoned, tired, or hungry. Emotion mind starts to take over when you are stressed or don’t feel well.

Although, reasonable mind is critical to dealing with reality, many of life’s problems have an emotional aspect.

==Emotional mind==

If reasonable mind runs &quot;cool&quot; then emotion mind runs &quot;hot.&quot; Passionate, extreme, and intense reactions in emotion mind make reasonable, logical thinking difficult. When an emotional state controls your thinking and behavior, emotion mind has taken over. Acting the way you feel is how emotion mind behaves.
Emotion mind can flood your system with energy in anger or zap your energy in depression. Impulsively acting the way you feel can lead to out of control behavior creating chaos, hurt feelings, and more problems. Emotion mind tends to be irresponsible, careless, mindless, impulsive, and impatient. Strong emotions distort facts, magnify excuses, and shrink your perception of consequences.

Of course, certain amount of emotion mind can be beneficial. Intense love is a motivation for intimate relationships. Intense devotion or desire motivates staying with very hard tasks and sacrificing oneself for others. Mothers running through fires to save their children are in emotion mind. People high in emotion mind are often passionate about people, causes, and beliefs - these are the dramatic, fun people of the world.

Misery and distress are emotional reactions to problems in living that make a difficult situation worse. You can, however, learn to use emotion and logic together concert to improve your quality of life. This is the goal of Wise Mind.

==Wise Mind==

Wise Mind is the active integration of Emotional Mind and Reasonable Mind. Wise Mind brings together the logic of reasonable mind and the sensitivity of emotional mind to a serene state of mind. When you relate what you know (your smarts) to your problems (what hurts) you are being skillful and in Wise Mind. Wise Mind joins what you know to your problems. Your effort to link your problems causing misery and distress with your reasonable, logical abilities is the basis of skillfulness and Wise Mind. But Wise Mind is more than this too; the magic of Wise Mind is intuition.

Intuition understands the meaning, significance, or truth of an event, without having to analyze it intellectually. Such intuitive knowing combines emotional experiencing and logical analysis, yet goes beyond them. Sometimes emotion can masquerade as intuition. You feel certain you &quot;know.&quot; If this &quot;knowing&quot; is intuitive it will still be valid when examined without the emotion of the moment. A calm certainty validates your intuition, helping you discern whether your certainty is emotionally biased or truly intuitive. Intuition has qualities of direct experience and immediate recognition, with the roots of reason and experience.

As you use your skills, you learn to act intuitively out of Wise Mind. Wise Mind is similar to intuition (or, perhaps, intuition is similar to Wise Mind). Acting intuitively out of Wise Mind, you trust that you know beyond what you think and feel. This takes flexibility, imagination, and open-mindedness. Awareness, in general, nurtures Wise Mind. Polarized thinking and a rigid worldview interfere with Wise Mind.

A way to become wise is to practice being wise. Such practice requires dedication to learning skills. Practice identifying and solving your problems of living. Some problems, of course, are quite easy and involve little more than writing a to-do list and following through on your plan. Everybody has problems in living. Successful people are better at accepting what they cannot change and changing the things they can. These successful people are informed with knowledge, armed with experience, and guided by intuition. Be willing to bring together the problems of living with your experience, knowledge and intuition.

Wisdom grows when you use your senses, develop your mind, and learn skills. Wisdom takes work. Start working by learning core mindfulness skills, interpersonal effectiveness skills, emotion regulation skills, and distress tolerance skills.

Wisdom, Wise Mind, or wise knowing depends on integration of all ways of knowing something: knowing by observing, knowing by analyzing logically, knowing by what you experience in your bodies (kinetic and sensory experience), knowing by learning and experience, and knowing by intuition. Knowing in these ways develops with awareness and awareness expands as you observe, analyze experience, learn, and intuit. By exploring the various ways of knowing and becoming more aware, you develop a sense of wholeness, continuity and coherence.

Wise Mind is like riding a bike, which takes effort, balance, and steering. You can learn Wise Mind, like you learned to ride a bike, only by experience. Just like you must pedal to start a bike rolling you must be willing to expend a little extra effort to initiate Wise Mind. As you would fall over if you were too far to one side or another on a bike, find Wise Mind by making the effort to find the balance of your emotions and thinking. Intuition steers you toward Wise Mind. The negative emotions (anxiety, depression, anger, shame, and guilt) are like putting on the brakes. Like you can jump on a bike and ride, you can learn to activate wise mind and do the best you can.

As you bring Wise Mind skills to the problems in living you will develop mastery. Mastery, the feeling of being competent and under control, does NOT mean you won’t make mistakes. Mastery is the attitude of bringing your skills to your problems in living.

Sometimes you may access wisdom when suddenly confronted by another person and stay calm under pressure. Sometimes you may find that in the midst of crisis you intuitively know the right thing to do. Sometimes approaching a difficult problem generates an insight that unlocks an inner door. Sometimes Wise Mind is seeing the whole picture not just the parts. Sometimes when faced with a difficult dilemma, Wise Mind reveals a clear choice. 

You will develop self-agency and self-awareness as you develop mindfulness, regulate your emotions, are effective interpersonally, and tolerate distress. Self-agency is the feeling you have when you are in control of your own behavior. Rather than feeling your behavior just happens, self-agency owns the behavior and takes responsibility for it. Self-awareness is the sense you have that your different roles, feelings, attitudes, and mental states fit together coherently.

==Meditation and Wise Mind==

Mindfulness exercises like meditation develop inner calm, emotional control, perseverance, and a strong sense of self. Herbert Benson, MD of Harvard Medical School was one of the first to research the therapeutic value of meditation. He found that meditation could elicit what he called the &quot;Relaxation Response,&quot; which is the physiological opposite of stress and anxiety. Meditation heals the damage of stress.
One of the simplest meditation exercises is to follow your breathing. When you meditate on your breath, you can find Wise Mind in the physical center found at the bottom of your inhalation. You can develop the ability to find your center during meditation and get to know this calm centered place well. If you learn where your center is and how it feels, you can go to this place, confident that you are responding in Wise Mind. Although meditation may be unfamiliar, you can cultivate the ability to be mindful.

Meditation and mindfulness develop your ability to observe what is going on within yourself in any situation. One way that people commonly experience this is to step back from one’s thoughts and feelings and release your attachment to these mental phenomena. The goal here is to reflect on your thinking and feeling, independent of the circumstances, observing what is going on in one’s mind like watching clouds drift through the sky.

Qualities of Wise Mind

Wise Mind is calm. It is almost always quiet and peaceful. When change or acceptance is necessary Wise mind is the serenity of knowing which course to take. Wise Mind is not trapped in all-or-nothing thinking and can focus on what is effective and functional.

In Wise Mind, you are in control of emotional mind. Behavior is not mood dependent (controlled by one’s emotions) but at the service of one’s inner wisdom. Eventually, objective self-observation and self-description are attainable from this slightly detached point of view. In fact, you can learn to experience extreme emotions like anger or fear while staying in Wise Mind. This takes lots of practice – for everybody. Likewise, in Wise Mind, you are able to access the knowledge of reasonable mind.

Wise Mind is courageous, i.e. feels scared but does what is needed in the situation anyway. Willingness is doing what is needed in each situation. Willingness often requires courage.

Wise Mind is confident. Self-confidence is knowing you can handle whatever problems in life comes along. When Wise Mind becomes clear, fear disappears. Wise Mind knows you are doing the best you can under the circumstances. When you skilfully approach your problems causing misery and distress, you are in Wise Mind and doing the best you can.

Clear and coherent sense of self: In Wise Mind, you can maintain your own feelings, opinions and decisions when around others. 

Self-description, a core mindfulness skill, helps you know yourself and resist unhealthy urges to conform to social pressure and change one’s mind. At the same time, you are strong enough not to be defensive when presented with alternative views that warrant your consideration. You can see more clearly who you are when you are quiet and peaceful. 

Self-observation develops self-understanding and accurate perception. The opposite of “automatic pilot” or doing something without thinking. Wise Mind is “being in the present on purpose.”

Through mindfulness, you will develop the skills to access your Wise 
Mind. With Wise Mind as the basis for problem solving, you will improve the quality of your life.

== Overview ==

A '''''half-blood''''' is someone with magical powers, having only one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|pure-blood]] parent, the other being either [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle-born|Muggle-born]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

&quot;Half-blood&quot; status is only important to those wizards who give weight to the &quot;blood purity&quot; beliefs, the unproven and legally unsupported belief that being able to prove Wizarding ancestry somehow grants additional status to an individual or family. To those who accept this belief system, a Half-blood wizard is inferior to one who can prove ancestry from Wizarding families.

== Analysis ==

Given the apparent group hysteria displayed by the proponents of the Blood Status theory, we perhaps should not be surprised that no distinction is drawn between the child of a Wizard and a Muggle, and the child of a Wizard and a Muggle-born.

Due to some process likely akin to hybrid vigor in genetics, quite often the most powerful wizards and witches spring from these intermarriages: classic examples would be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]. Equally, weaker wizards can come from pure-blood families; examples here would be [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]]. However, there is quite a large faction of wizards, headed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], who believe that only pure-bloods should be educated in magic, and in fact that everyone other than the purebloods should be wiped off the face of the Earth.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
#What parallels can be drawn between instances in Muggle World History such as the Civil Rights movement and the role of Half-Blood characters in Harry Potter?
#If you were a half-blood wizard how would you feel knowing that Voldemort was in power once more?
#How far can you say that the tensions between Voldemort and half-blood wizards is at the heart of the Wizarding Wars?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Comparison==
Two strings are '''equal by value''' if they have the same content:
* If &quot;Hello&quot; = &quot;Hello&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;A&quot;

The statement '''Option Compare Text''' can be placed at the top of a module to make the comparison '''case-insensitive''', impacting =, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt;&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Option Compare Text
Sub Test()
  If &quot;Hello&quot; = &quot;hello&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;A&quot;
  If &quot;aaa&quot; &lt; &quot;BBB&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;B&quot;
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

To test whether two strings are '''equal by reference''', that is, whether they start at the same address, you can use StrPtr function.

To test whether a string is '''greater than or less''' than another using lexicographical order, you can use &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt;&gt;. To decide whether a string is less than another, the two are compared character by character and as soon as a character from one string is found to have a lower ASCII code than the corresponding (same position) character in the other string, the first is declared to be ''less than'' the second. The converse test also works.

Another way of testing whether strings are equal or greater than one another is the '''StrComp''' function. Unlike =, &lt;, &gt;, etc., the StrComp function has an optional argument that controls whether the comparison is case-sensitive.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
strHello = &quot;hello&quot;: strHello2 = &quot;Hello&quot;
If StrComp(strHello, strHello2, vbTextCompare) = 0 Then
  Debug.Print &quot;The strings are the same.&quot;
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

==Concatenation==

The operator intended to perform string contatenation is ''&amp;''. The operator ''+'' can sometimes be used to the same effect, but not always:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
a = &quot;123&quot;
b = &quot;456&quot;
c = a &amp; b 'Yields 123456
d = a + b 'Yields 123456: applied to two strings
Debug.Print c, d

a = 123   'A number, not a string
b = &quot;456&quot; 'A string
c = a &amp; b 'Yields 123456
d = a + b 'Yields 579: applied to a number and to a string
Debug.Print c, d
&lt;/source&gt;

==Containment==
To find out if one string is a substring of another, use the InStr
function as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If InStr(&quot;Hello&quot;,&quot;He&quot;) &gt; 0 Then
    MsgBox &quot;The second string is contained in the first string.&quot;
  End If
  If InStr(&quot;He&quot;,&quot;Hello&quot;) &gt; 0 Then
    MsgBox &quot;This never gets printed; wrong argument order.&quot;
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

InStr function returns the position of the substring if it is found or zero otherwise.

The two-argument use of InStr function is case-sensitive. A case-insensitive containment test can be done as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  If InStr(UCase(&quot;Hello&quot;), UCase(&quot;he&quot;)) &gt; 0 Then
    MsgBox &quot;The second string is contained in the first string when we &quot; &amp; _
           &quot;disregard the case.&quot;
  End If
&lt;/source&gt;

==Replacing==
To replace a string with another string inside a third string, use the
built-in function Replace as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Result = Replace(&quot;Teh Beatles&quot;, &quot;Teh&quot;, &quot;The&quot;) 'results into &quot;The Beatles&quot;  
&lt;/source&gt;

==Indexing and Substrings==
Strings can be used almost as if they were lists of characters. The '''nth character in a string''' can be returned by subscripting:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Mid$(String1, n, 1)
&lt;/source&gt;

The values of n start from 1 rather than from 0.

It is also possible to return a '''substring''' of a string. The same
function is used but instead of specifying 1, you specify the
length of the substring:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Offset = 2: Length = 3
Debug.Print Mid$(&quot;abcdef&quot;, Offset , Length) 'Prints bcd
&lt;/source&gt;

If you ask for more characters than are available, you get just
what there is, no error is raised:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Debug.Print Mid$(&quot;abcdef&quot;, 2, 33) 'Prints bcdef
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also use '''Mid$''' on the '''left-hand side''' of an assignment:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
String1 = &quot;aaaaaa&quot;
Debug.Print String1 'Prints aaaaaa
Mid$(String1, 2, 3) = &quot;bbb&quot;
Debug.Print String1 'Prints abbbaa
Mid$(String1, 3, 1) = &quot;cccccc&quot;
Debug.Print String1 'Prints abcbaa
Mid$(String1, 2, 3) = &quot;d&quot;
Debug.Print String1 'Prints adcbaa
&lt;/source&gt;

When Mid$ is on the left, it doesn't change the total length of the string: it just replaces the specified number of characters. If the right-hand side specifies fewer characters than are asked for, only that number of characters is replaced; if it specifies more, only the number asked for is used.

==String constants==
String constants can be declared like any other constant:

  Const s As String = &quot;abcdef&quot;

==String Functions==
Strings are not objects so they do not have methods but there is a number of
functions that manipulate strings.  Note that none of the functions
modify the original string, except for Mid$ when it is on the left
hand side of an assignment statement:

;Asc: Returns the integer code of the first character of the string. The inverse function would be ''Chr''.
;Len: Returns the length of the string.
;InStr: Returns the character index of the first occurrence of the substring in a string or zero if the substring is not found.
;InstrB: Like InStr except that it returns the byte position. It has to be remembered, that Visual Basic 6 strings are Unicode strings.
;InstrRev: Like InStr except that it returns the character position of the last occurrence of the substring.
;Left$: Returns the specified number of characters from the beginning of the string.  If there are fewer characters in the string Left$ returns the whole string, no error is raised,
;Mid$: Returns a number of characters starting at the given position, on the left hand side it replaces those characters, 
;Right$: Returns the specified number of characters from the end of the string, if there are not that many characters, then Right$ returns the whole string.
;IsNumeric: Returns true if the string looks like a number. 
;LTrim$, RTrim$, Trim$: Returns a copy of the string with leading, trailing or leading and trailing spaces removed respectively.  Note that only ASCII spaces (character code 32)  are removed, other whitespace characters such as tabs are treated as non-spaces.
;LCase$, UCase: Converts the whole string to lower case or upper case respectively.
;Val: Returns a number corresponding to the number found at the start of the string.  Note that ''Val'' is not locale aware, which means that it always expects decimal points regardless of the regional settings of your computer; if you are reading from a comma delimited file this is probably the function you want to use.
;Str: Returns a string corresponding to the given number.  Like ''Val'' this is not locale aware.  This is the function you should use if you are creating a text file containing numbers to be read on someone else's computer.
;CStr: Converts the expression to a string.  This procedure ''is'' locale aware and the correct function to use if converting numbers and differently typed values to strings for user-display.  Usually it is unnecessary because Visual Basic automatically converts when necessary and uses ''Regional Settings'' to do so.
;Format$: Converts a number to a string using a specific format.  The format is provided as a string of characters, that shows how many digits should be given before and after the decimal point.  Like ''CStr'', ''Format$'' is locale aware so the decimal separator will be whatever is specified in the user's ''Regional Settings''.  ''Format$'' also provides for conversion of dates to various built-in and custom string formats.
;CBool, CByte, CCur, CInt, CLng, CSng, CDbl, CDec: Locale aware conversions to ''Boolean'', ''Byte'', ''Currency'', ''Integer'', ''Long'', ''Single'', ''Double'', ''Decimal''.
;Split: Chops a string into pieces and returns a ''Variant Array''.  If no delimiter is specified then spaces will be used.  Delimiters may be any string of any length.  Two adjacent delimiters delimit an empty string.
;Hex$: Returns a string of ''Hex'' characters representing a number.
;Oct$: Returns a string of ''Octal'' characters representing a number.
;Replace$: Returns a string with occurrences of a specified substring replaced with a new string.  Note that the substring and the new string do not have to be the same size.
;StrComp: Returns -1 if the first string is less than the second, 0 if they are identical, +1 if the first is greater than the second.  Takes an optional argument that determines the comparison algorithm: vbBinary for exact comparisons using the character codes, vbTextCompare for case insensitive comparisons.

==Quotes in strings==
Because the double quote (&quot;) is used to delimit strings, you can't use it directly to specify a quote within a string. For example
  ' Does not work - syntax error
  Debug.Print &quot;Fred says &quot;Hi&quot; to you&quot;
One way is to use that Chr() function to specify the character code (34)
  ' Works fine
  Debug.Print &quot;Fred says &quot; &amp; Chr$(34) &amp; &quot;Hi&quot; &amp; Chr$(34) &amp; &quot; to you&quot;
Another is to double the double-quotes. You might find this more or less readable than the above way.
  ' Works fine too
  Debug.Print &quot;Fred says &quot;&quot;Hi&quot;&quot; to you&quot;

==Startswith and Endswith==
Visual Basic does not have functions &quot;startsWith&quot; (or &quot;BeginsWith&quot;) and &quot;endsWith&quot; found in some other programming languages. But it has &quot;Like&quot; comparison operator used for simple pattern matching that does the job when used with &quot;*&quot; to stand for &quot;any string of characters&quot;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
If &quot;Hello World&quot; Like &quot;Hello*&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;It starts.&quot;
If &quot;Hello World&quot; Like &quot;*World&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;It ends.&quot;
If LCase(&quot;Hello World&quot;) Like &quot;hello*&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;It starts, case insensitive.&quot;
If LCase(&quot;Hello World&quot;) Like &quot;*world&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;It ends, case insensitive.&quot;
Ending = &quot;World&quot;
If &quot;Hello World&quot; Like &quot;*&quot; &amp; Ending Then MsgBox &quot;It ends.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Furthermore, you can write these functions yourself using &quot;Left&quot; function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Function StartsWith(Str1 As String, Str2 As String, Optional CaseIns As Boolean) As Boolean
  StartsWith = False
  If CaseIns Then 'Case insensitive
    If Left(LCase(Str1), Len(Str2)) = LCase(Str2) Then
      StartsWith = True
    End If
  Else
    If Left(Str1, Len(Str2)) = Str2 Then
      StartsWith = True
    End If
  End If
End Function

Function EndsWith(Str1 As String, Str2 As String, Optional CaseIns As Boolean) As Boolean
  EndsWith = False
  If CaseIns Then 'Case insensitive
    If Right(LCase(Str1), Len(Str2)) = LCase(Str2) Then
      EndsWith = True
    End If
  Else
    If Right(Str1, Len(Str2)) = Str2 Then
      EndsWith = True
    End If
  End If
End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

For a one-off comparison to a constant string, a function call may be an overkill:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
If Left(String1, 9) = &quot;Beginning&quot; Then
  'Starts with, case-sensitive
  ...
Else
  ...
End If

If Right(String1, 3) = &quot;end&quot; Then
  'Ends with, case-sensitive
  ...
Else
  ...
End If
&lt;/source&gt;

==Pattern Matching==
You can do simple pattern matching with '''Like''' keyword; for complex pattern matching, see [[../Regular Expressions/]]. The special characters in the patterns of ''Like'' include ? for a single char, * for any number of chars, # for a single decimal digit, [...] for a single char in the list, and [!...] for a single char not in the list.

Examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
If &quot;Hello World&quot; Like &quot;Hello*&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;A&quot;
If &quot;Hello World&quot; Like &quot;*World&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;B&quot;
If &quot;Itam&quot; Like &quot;It?m&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;G&quot;
If &quot;AB345&quot; Like &quot;[A-Z][A-Z]###&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;C&quot;
If &quot;Ab345&quot; Like &quot;[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z]###&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;D&quot;
If &quot;Item&quot; Like &quot;[!;][!;][!;][!;]&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;E&quot;
If Not &quot;It;m&quot; Like &quot;[!;][!;][!;][!;]&quot; Then MsgBox &quot;F&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview of Data Structures ==
There are about a handful of standard data structures types.  
* Stack
* Queue
* More to come...

These can be implemented in various ways, but the specific characteristics of each are always maintained. 

=== Stack ===
In short a stack is a collection of data with the Last In First Out (LIFO) paradigm.  This means that the last item put on the stack is the first one that would come off of it.  Items beyond this item cannot be directly accessed or removed, short of clearing the stack entirely.

These are the general actions one can perform on a stack:
* push - push something onto the top of the stack
* pop - pop the top of the stack (the last thing put on)
* peek - look at the item on the top of the stack (the last thing put on)
* is_empty - check to see if the stack is empty
* is_full - check to see if the stack is full

Keep in mind that exactly how one implements a stack can be completely different and this could cause the methods available on a stack to differ as well.  For example, if the stack is static (cannot grow) and has a size of N, having the is_full is handy to tell when the stack is full.  However, if the stack is dynamic (it can grow, if necessary) the is_full isn't handy if the stack can not technically fill up.  Though some might choose to have a dynamic stack with an upper limit, making the is_full useful again.   Also, it depends on the style of the developer creating the stack.  At a minium there will always be something like a push or pop, though they might have different names.

Some tangible examples of a stack:
* Think of the [http://pezco.securesites.com/collectors/index.php Pez Candy dispensers] - the last candy you put in is the first one out.   
* Here's another one - the plate dispensers in a buffet line. The plates are piled inside on a spring loaded platform and customers take them off the top, one by one.  

Some computer related ones: 
* a RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator.

=== Queue ===

A queue is a collection of data with the First In First Out (FIFO) paradigm.  This means that the first data put into it is the first data returned from it.  Items cannot be randomly access from within the queue, only the item in the &quot;first&quot; position can be accessed.  If you want to think of it terms of time - the oldest item in the array is the first one returned and the only one accessible at any one time. 

These are the general actions that can be performed by a queue:
* enqueue - put something on the end of the queue
* dequeue - remove the first thing from the queue (the oldest)
* is_full - check to see if the queue is full
* is_empty - check to see if the queue is empty

As with the stack, the is_full (and maybe the is_empty) may or may not be useful depending on the implementation (static array, dynamic array, linked list... etc).  Which methods are available also depends on the style of the developer creating the queue. At a minimum there will always be enqueue and dequeue, though they might have different names. 

Some tangible examples of a queue: 
* a line for a ride at an amusement part - the people in front, who have been waiting the longest, go first (or next). 
* a line at a bank, where people are waiting for the next available teller.

== Mechanical Resistance ==

&lt;p&gt;For most systems, a simple oscillator is not a very accurate model.  While a simple oscillator involves a continuous transfer of energy between kinetic and potential form, with the sum of the two remaining constant, real systems involve a loss, or dissipation, of some of this energy, which is never recovered into kinetic nor potential energy.  The mechanisms that cause this dissipation are varied and depend on many factors.  Some of these mechanisms include drag on bodies moving through the air, thermal losses, and friction, but there are many others.  Often, these mechanisms are either difficult or impossible to model, and most are non-linear.  However, a simple, linear model that attempts to account for all of these losses in a system has been developed.

== Dashpots ==
&lt;p&gt; The most common way of representing mechanical resistance in a damped system is through the use of a dashpot.  A dashpot acts like a shock absorber in a car.  It produces resistance to the system's motion that is proportional to the system's velocity.  The faster the motion of the system, the more mechanical resistance is produced.  

&lt;p&gt; As seen in the graph above, a linear relationship is assumed between the force of the dashpot and the velocity at which it is moving.  The constant that relates these two quantities is &lt;math&gt;R_M&lt;/math&gt;, the mechanical resistance of the dashpot.  This relationship, known as the viscous damping law, can be written as:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; F = R\cdot u &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

Also note that the force produced by the dashpot is always in phase with the velocity.

&lt;p&gt; The power dissipated by the dashpot can be derived by looking at the work done as the dashpot resists the motion of the system:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; P_D = \frac{1}{2}\Re\left[\hat{F}\cdot\hat{u^*}\right]= \frac{|\hat{F}|^{2}}{2R_{M}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Modeling the Damped Oscillator ==

&lt;p&gt;In order to incorporate the mechanical resistance (or damping) into the forced oscillator model, a dashpot is placed next to the spring.  It is connected to the mass (&lt;math&gt;M_M&lt;/math&gt;) on one end and attached to the ground on the other end.  A new equation describing the forces must be developed:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;F - S_Mx - R_Mu = M_Ma  \rightarrow  F = S_Mx + R_M\dot{x} + M_M\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's phasor form is given by the following:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat{F}e^{j\omega t} = \hat{x}e^{j\omega t}\left[S_M + j\omega R_M + \left(-\omega ^2\right)M_M\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Mechanical Impedance for Damped Oscillator ==

&lt;p&gt;Previously, the impedance for a simple oscillator was defined as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\frac{F}{u}}&lt;/math&gt;.  Using the above equations, the impedance of a damped oscillator can be calculated:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat{Z_M} = \frac{\hat{F}}{\hat{u}} = R_M + j\left(\omega M_M - \frac{S_M}{\omega}\right) = |\hat{Z_M}|e^{j\Phi_Z}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For very low frequencies, the spring term dominates because of the &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; relationship.  Thus, the phase of the impedance approaches &lt;math&gt;\frac{-\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; for very low frequencies.  This phase causes the velocity to &quot;lag&quot; the force for low frequencies.  As the frequency increases, the phase difference increases toward zero.  At resonance, the imaginary part of the impedance vanishes, and the phase is zero.  The impedance is purely resistive at this point.  For very high frequencies, the mass term dominates.  Thus, the phase of the impedance approaches &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the velocity &quot;leads&quot; the force for high frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on the previous equations for dissipated power, we can see that the real part of the impedance is indeed &lt;math&gt;R_M&lt;/math&gt;.  The real part of the impedance can also be defined as the cosine of the phase times its magnitude.  Thus, the following equations for the power can be obtained.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;W_R = \frac{1}{2}\Re\left[\hat{F}\hat{u^{*}}\right] = \frac{1}{2}R_M|\hat{u}|^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{|\hat{F}|^2}{|\hat{Z_M}|^2}R_M = \frac{1}{2}\frac{|\hat{F}|^2}{|\hat{Z_M}|}cos(\Phi_Z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Want to know what's going on in the mind of spideyworm?  I can try to explain it to you, but I doubt you'll understand what I don't understand.  Nonetheless, this is a good spot to air my thoughts on the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] wikibook, the [[Blender 3D]] wikibooks in general, and other pressing issues.  Hope you enjoy and post some feedback.

==Book Status==
'''September 2nd, 2005'''

Well, what has happened to the Noob to Pro lately?  To be honest, not much.  I've lost steam and also run out of things I can teach.  If you're a Blender noob, you don't want another Blender noob teaching you the finer points of 3D modeling, am I right?  When you're new, the habits you develop early on can affect you the rest of your Blending life, so I want to teach the best of habits.  I really want to start kids right.  I tried contacting some of the better modellers in the community asking for their help writing tutorials, which they gladly offered... but they haven't actually contributed anything yet, as far as I know....  If you all have to wait for me to become a master modeller before I finish the wikibook, you will simply have to wait.

I've been contacted by some people wondering why the book lost quality partway through.  It's simple: lack of a cohesive writing style.  How many people have made edits to this thing?  Lots.  How many different writing styles are we talking?  Just as many.  Give it time, I will go through and bring the whole thing together so that it flows nicely.  Someday.  I'd love to see this thing in print someday, so it will happen sometime before then.

I was contacted by Stefano Selleri and Ton Roosendaal recently to consult the official Blender documentation and book authors on the possibility of moving from DocBook to MediaWiki for content development.  We had quite the lively discussion on this topic ([http://projects.blender.org/pipermail/bf-docboard/2005-August/thread.html read here], remember that I'm David Millet).  I'd love to hear your feedback on the idea.

Ah yes, I should plug the irc channel.  Good place to talk about where wiki meets the Blender.  #wikiblender on irc.freenode.net.  Hope to see you there.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:59, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

Hey, do you still work on the Blender noob to pro book? I'm a noob when it comes to Blender, so the tutorials great! However it has a long way to go before it'll make me a pro... I know that a few noobs have worked on it here and there recently, but do you know if any pro's are still actually working with it?

      <text xml:space="preserve">''In earlier days for reception of VLF signals you either had to buy or to build an appropriate receiver or converter. Today it is much easier; you only need a standard PC with a sound card (Pentium processor and clock speed of 100 MHz or more is also required) and a few additional devices.''

Every PC (with Pentium processor and a beat frequency of 100 MHz and more) with a built-in sound card can be converted with the usage of only a little additional equipment into a powerful receiver for frequencies below 24 kHz! As hardware only an appropriate aerial, as software a spectral analysis program, which is available on the internet as freeware, is required.

==Aerial==
The use of an inductive aerial is recommended for VLF reception.
This aerial should consist of a coil with as many windings and as large a diameter as possible.

The electrical and mechanical properties of the coil, its inductance, resistance in ohms, number of turns, etc. are of low importance and may vary in a widely. Therefore its manufacture is very easy.
You only need one roll of insulated wire, which is connected to the LINE or MIC input of the sound card with a cable at least 2 metres long. As cable you can use any type with two conductors (although shielded or coaxial cable should be quieter).

In many shops ready-soldered plugs can be bought for all types of PC sound card inputs and you may need not even have to solder the necessary plug for the sound card input by yourself.

For good reception the coil should be placed as far away as possible from the PC (if possible at least 2 metres) and from other electrical devices, with the axis being parallel with the ground.

In buildings made of steel and concrete a place near the window is the best choice.

It is possible, if you want to achieve a higher sensitivity, to connect two or more coils in series. You have to mind the sense (clockwise or counterclockwise) of the windings, otherwise the induced signals cancel each other out.

[[Image:VLF-Antenne1.jpg|thumb|Reception aerial for VLF consisting of a serial connection of 4 wire rolls, from which two share one common axis. Each wire roll has a diameter of 10.3 centimetres and 309 windings. With the paperclips it is possible for test purposes to short-circuit one or more of
the rolls.]]

==Setting of sound card input==

After the aerial was connected to the sound card input, the signal input to be used must be selected at the PC.
Therefore click with the right mouse button on the loudspeaker symbol at the right end of the Windows task bar. 

[[Image:TLEIS1.jpg|thumb|Windows task bar with loudspeaker symbol]]

A popup menu appears, on which you have to choose the option for &quot;loudness&quot; or &quot;Open Volume Controls (w2k)&quot;.
On the dialog, which is now shown, click on the menu point for &quot;options&quot; and then choose from the sub menu the point &quot;properties&quot;.
You will see a second dialog on the screen, click the button for &quot;recording&quot; and click afterwards on the &quot;OK&quot; button. 
Now you can set the sound card entrance you want to use. For VLF reception, the balance control of this entrance should be put in the middle and the loudness regulator to maximal loudness.
All these settings can be changed of course later, if e.g. the spectral analysis of a sound signal shall be done, which is fed via an other soundcard entrance in the PC.

==General considerations about the reception technique and analysis software==

There are many programmes available for the spectral analysis of signals, which come via the sound card in the PC (look http://www.vlf.it/harald/strangerec.htm).
My favourite software is &quot;SpecPlus&quot;, since this extremely powerful software offers the possibility to save the received signals as frequency/time/intensity diagrams (such called spectrograms) automatically in a disk space saving way as jpeg files.
Besides this, &quot;SpecPlus&quot; runs very stable, when a Windows95, Windows98 or Windows ME operating system is used. (I do not know how well it runs under Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 or Windows XP. It does not work under Windows3.x!)
Monitors of PCs generate strong noise in the VLF range. For this reason it is very sensible not to view the spectrograms directly on the screen, but saving them as file on hard disk and viewing them at a later point of time.
Therefore automatically working with monitor switched off is the best operation mode. Between midnight and 6o'clock local standard time is usually the best time for VLF reception, because most electric devices are switched off at that time and the level of disturbing signals is therefore lowest.
As a corollary, the PC is probably not being used for other tasks at these hours, so it can be used for VLF reception!

==The Software &quot;SpecLab&quot;==

&quot;SpecLab&quot; is downloadable as zip file from http://www.qsl.net/dl4yhf/spectra1.html.
After successful download and extraction with WinZip in an installation directory, the software can be installed, experience shows that no troubles occur. The program runs under Windows 98, 2000, ME, XP, Linux/WINE, but not under Windows Vista.

[[Image:SPECP1.jpg|thumb|&quot;SpecLab&quot; — main dialog]]

After successful installation some settings have to be done.
First you should set the colour palette. There are many false colour display modes available.
Although false colour displays can look like somewhat pop, I prefer for good reason a mode which shows the signals black and the background white.
First, such a display mode can be easily understood without knowledge of the colour palette used and you can, if you want, compress the received jpeg files further with other programmes without loosing information (if you use a display in false colours the colours can easily changed by this process. This effect is not desired at all, because the colours show the intensity of the signal, so the information is lost in compression.
For the setting of the colour palette a file containing an appropriate colour palette is load via the menu point &quot;Option&quot; and the submenu point &quot;Load Color Palette&quot;.
Now the sampling rate is adjusted. Choose therefore the menu point &quot;Option&quot; and then the submenu point &quot;Audio Settings&quot;.
The sampling rate determines the value of the highest frequency you can receive. Its value is:
F = sampling rate / (2 * Input Sample Rate Divisor).
For a maximum reception frequency of 24 kHz (customary sound cards cannot process input signals with higher frequencies), you have to set the sampling rate on 48000 Hertz and the Input Sample Rate Divisor on 1.
Then you have to fix the FFT properties. Choose therefore under &quot;options&quot; the menu point &quot;FFT Settings&quot;.
For VLF reception you must set FFT Output on &quot;Logarithmic&quot; and for FFT type you should choose &quot;Real Number FFT Starting at 0&quot;.
At last the display mode is adjusted. Therefore, select &quot;Display Spectrum display Settings&quot; submenu via the &quot;Option&quot; menu.

Set the amplitude range on the dialog which will now appear for VLF reception between -130 dB and -60dB.
Experience shows that this range is very sensitive for the display of VLF signals, because stronger signals do normally not occur and the noise of the sound card has a value in the order of -110dB to -120dB.
There are some further adjustments possible in this window (look at the picture).

[[Image:SPECP2.jpg|thumb| ]]

Finally you have to adjust in the main dialog with the controls &quot;B&quot; (brightness) and &quot;C&quot; (contrast) below &quot;Color Palette&quot; the best value for the sensitivity. Disconnect or short-circuit your aerial for this purpose and move the control &quot;B&quot; so that the background just appears white.
Set the contrast of the display with the control &quot;C&quot;.
You can set it in such way, that small differences in signal intensity appear or not. 
Because of the fact that the settings of the regulator &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; influence each other, you have perhaps to do these steps several times, until you are content with the display.
Afterwards your PC is ready for VLF reception!

For automatic operation you have to choose under the menu point &quot;File&quot;, the submenu point &quot;Periodic actions&quot;.


[[Image:SPECP3.jpg|thumb| ]]

With the settings shown here every 40 seconds a graphic file showing the spectrogram with the name &quot;ns&quot; + running number(starting with 1) + &quot;.jpg&quot; is written into the directory g:\vlf\07032002.
(I assign with the two letters at the beginning of the file name the direction, in which the axis of the reception coil shows: 'ns' is for north/south direction, 'ow' for east/west direction'. This is very sensible, because the used aerial shows, as does every inductive aerial, a strong directional characteristic.)
Keep in mind, that the directory you mention, must exist and that there is a toggle at &quot;active&quot;.
Otherwise no recordings are done!

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the VLF-range signals from transmitters and jammers can be received. 

The following table contains the most important signals in the range under 24 kHz. One should not expect to receive all stations at the same time. Some of the specified stationa are only few minutes per week active. Since these stations nearly all for the transmission of news to submerged submarines of naval forces, no transmission plans are available. Also a decoding of the signals might not succeed. One can enjoy however frequently about the signals on the spectrograms.

=== Quotes===
:It is one thing to understand the points of the compass, quite another to use them in order to find one's way in a life circumscribed by one's own refusals
:::Doing Time, Lynn Freed, Harper's Magazine, July 2005, Vol 311, No 1862, Page 66


:As with almost everything, moderation is a good idea. (And for those wondering about the &quot;almost,&quot; I suggest that marital fidelity, reliable childcare, and obedience to laws are examples of areas where moderation isn't such a good idea after all.)
:::Brain Training, Orson Scott Card,  http://ornery.org/essays/warwatch/2005-06-26-1.html


:There is a clash [within western] civilization.  On one side are secular naturalists, who believe that life arose out of the primordial soup, that it has no transcendent meaning, that the task of government is to protect people from having any infringement on their desire to do whatever they choose to do, that truth is merely a preference.  On the other side are those who believe in overriding natural moral law, a created order, the knowability of truth.  The so-called culture war involves abortion, gay “marriage,” cloning, and the like; but at a far deeper level it forces us to face the question of who we are, what it means to be human, whether it is possible to continue to enjoy ordered liberty. 
:::Chuck Colson quoted in THOUGHTS : 'A perilous venture' 
:::© 2006 WORLD Magazine, March 18, 2006, Vol. 21, No. 11

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Chaizzilla. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Chaizzilla~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

:''See also:'' general anatomy page at [[Radiation_Oncology/Anatomy#Thorax]]

==Lung Anatomy==
[[Image:Gray962.png|thumb|right]]

*Lungs: Right and Left
*Lobes:
**Right Lung: Right Upper Lobe (RUL), Right Middle Lobe (RML), Right Lower Lobe (RLL). Separated by oblique fissure and horizontal fissure
**Left Lung: Left Upper Lobe (LUL), Left Lower Lobe (LLL). Separated by oblique fissure. Lingula corresponds anatomically to RML, but is part of the LUL
*Segments
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
!Right|| Segments || Left || Segments
|-
| RUL || align=&quot;center&quot; | 3 || LUL  || align=&quot;center&quot; | 5 
|-
| RML || align=&quot;center&quot; | 2 ||  || 
|-
| RLL || align=&quot;center&quot; | 5 || LLL || align=&quot;center&quot; | 5
|}
*Bronchi
**Trachea divides into [[w:Right main bronchus|right main bronchus]] and [[w:Left main bronchus|left main bronchus]], supplying right and left lung respectively
**Each main bronchus divides into [[w:Secondary bronchus|secondary (lobar) bronchi]], depending on how many lobes each lung has (3 lobar bronchi on the right, 2 lobar bronchi on the left)
**Each secondary bronchus divides into [[w:Tertiary bronchi|tertiary (segmental) bronchi]], depending on the number of segments each lobe has
**Tertiary bronchi divide into bronchioles
*[[w:Lung volumes|Lung volumes]] are typically evaluated by [[w:Spirometry|spirometry]]
**Total Lung Capacity (TLC): Volume of lung at the end of maximal inspiration. Depends on age, height, weight, sex, altitude, etc. Normally 4-6 L; women have 20-25% lower TLC than men
**Forced Vital Capacity (FVC): Volume of air that can be forced out after maximal inspiration
**Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1): Volume of air that can be forced out in one second
**FEV1/FVC (FEV1%): Ratio of FEV1 to FVC, i.e. the proportion of Vital Capacity that can be expelled during one second. Typically 75-80%

==Lymph node stations==
*Conceptual organization
**Intrapulmonary (along secondary bronchi)
**Hilar (bronchopulmonary, along main bronchi)
**Mediastinal
**Supraclavicular

'''Oberon''' is a moon of the planet Uranus. It is the outermost of the major moons of Uranus. Oberon was first seen in detail when the spacecraft Voyager 2 passed by Uranus in 1986.

==How big is Oberon?==
This moon is 1523 km across. It is the second largest of the moons of Uranus, and is only slightly smaller than Titania. The total surface has an area that is less than the continent of Australia.

==What is its surface like?==
Only half of this moon has been seen from a close distance, so we only know what that surface is like. The ground looks like it is made of ice with some darker materials. The surface is covered by many craters that were formed when large rocks collided with the moon. It is a very, very cold place that does not have an atmosphere.

==How long is a day on Oberon?==
It takes 13 days and 11 hours for Oberon to complete an orbit around Uranus, just under two weeks.

==What is it made of?==
This moon is made of a mixture of rocks, ice, and other frozen materials.

==How much would Oberon's gravity pull on me?==
'''Newtons''' describe how hard gravity is pulling you down.  On Earth, if you weigh 51 kilograms or 112 pounds, your weight is 500 newtons. We only use newtons for some special purposes, when we are really interested in how hard we push down on something because gravity is pulling us.

Your weight in newtons would be less on Oberon, only about one twenty-eighth what it is on Earth.  To find your weight in newtons as you stand on Oberon, just take your weight on Earth, and if that weight is in kilograms, multiply it by 0.35.  If that weight is in pounds, divide it by six to get newtons.  But then you'll have to add in the weight of your spacesuit as well, because that is pressing down on the surface just like you are.

==Who is it named after?==
The name for this moon was suggested by John Herschel, the son of Sir William Hershel. It was named after the mythical King of the Faeries in William Shakespeare's play ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. This character was drawn from the legendary history of Britain, and is based on the legends of King Arthur and his times.

==How was it discovered?==
It was discovered by the English astronomer William Herschel on January 11, 1787.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi all,

Stefano and I have been chatting a bit today; he feels strongly that
there's something better than docbook out there and so he's been asking
me a lot of questions about media wiki.  He's asked me to share the
strong points of media wiki with the rest of the list.

1) Mediawiki is easier to write with.
- the formatting is easy to learn and very quick to type.  For example:
        - for images: [[Image:myImage.png]]
        - for italics: ''my italicized text''
        - for bold: '''my bold'''
        - for indenting an entire paragraph, just use &quot;:&quot; -    :this is
my paragraph and I will be indented
        - for indenting the paragraph twice-    ::this paragraph is indented twice

2) Mediawiki does not require heavy uploads every time you make changes
(which if I understand correctly was caused by CVS).  It comes with it's
own versioning system that makes it simple to compare differences
between any two versions of a page, and it's simple to revert back to
previous versions, all within the same wiki interface.

3) Mediawiki will take the HTML from docbook pages and accept it just
fine, we can just copy and paste from the old into the new.  the
mediawiki engine will take straight HTML as well as the other
formatting.... you don't have to use wiki formatting such as ''' or
[[ ]] when you create pages, if you don't want, although it is quicker
to do so.

4) Mediawiki will simultaneously offer us the opportunity to control
who's editing pages of the book, but allow everyone in the world to
participate in discussions about the state of each page of the book.  if
you want to see what i mean about the discussions, check out this
discussion for the Noob to Pro wikibook front page:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro  .  The
community will be allowed to see the book in open development and
provide feedback, which some of you may like and others may not, but
hey, a little bit of community feedback never killed anyone, right? ;)

5) Mediawiki will also allow us to create community editable sections
where they can further discuss the documentation and write sample
documentations so that they can be considered to be authors.  Nothing
creates a instant community like a wiki.

6) The whole mediawiki interface is easily customizable through HTML
templates.  New functionality is simple to program in if you know PHP
and MySQL (which I do, and I know quite a few other Blender guys that do
as well).

Well, this is a bit longer than I intended it to be, and I hope you'll
forgive me for that.  If you have any questions or feedback, you know
what to do ;)  Stefano needs good information for both sides in order to
make a good decision on the matter, so I hope you all will sound off
with some sage reasoning on the pros and cons of both.

Hi,

I've got too much mails already, so have disabled the docboard mailing  
list to send mails to me. :) The web archive is available though, so  
I've scanned the past discussion on DocBook vs. Wiki. Here's a couple  
of notes;

- Printed books
Yes, the Blender Foundation completely depends on sales of manuals, so  
we will need to start working on a 2.4 manual update as well. However,  
that is not something the docboard should worry about too much, apart  
from keeping the docs on Blender well structured and accessible.
The choice for DocBook didn't really help us for making a book about  
Blender. The exporting formats as available completely failed to work  
in the Adobe Indesign software (which the DTP designers used). I also  
hear Stefano regularly complaining about bugs in DocBook, like for  
exporting to pdfs.
So, if we want to make another book, we already know that the book  
Editor and the designers will have to do a lot of manual labour to get  
the docs content into print. The 2.3 book took 4 months to produce... I  
also consider this work 'professional', the people who make this happen  
get paid for it.
Conclusion; it's not so much the format that matters, but how well  
structured the content itself is. Is it well formatted (chapter  
structure)? Are the screenshots of a standard quality?

- DocBook
I have the impression that the biggest fans of DocBook are not the  
people who contribute to our docboard project... at least, this was how  
the choice was initially done. I've tried myself to work with it, and I  
can only say the design of the DocBook XML tags system is a nightmare.  
It hasn't been designed to work with easily, unless you use a WYSIWYG  
editor, which I didn't find back then (when we did 2.3 manual).
Googling around on DocBook, I find a lot of debates on the topic. The  
most passionate supporters of DocBook are (typical!) Linux authors  
who've written a book themselves. For a community oriented project it  
seems to be less succesful.

- DocBoard mission statement
The docboard could focus on the following two issues:
1) Make available the standard end-user documentation on Blender, in an  
open online (browsable) and offline (downloadable) format.
2) Organize an accessible documentation project, to enable motivated  
authors to contribute as efficient as possible.
As sub-target you could add;
3) Format the documentation in such a way that third parties (or  
Blender Foundation) can use it for creating printed books.

- Other formats...?
The discussion to switch to (for example) MediaWiki should be about:
1) What format gives best online and offline access to Blender docs?
2) What format pleases motivated (active contributing) authors best?

A decision on this should really be limited to the people who actually  
did write a lot of Blender documentation in the past. We need people  
who love to work on docs, and are movitvated to continue working on it  
in the future too. :)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Radmind Assistant is a GUI app for Mac OS X.

As of Sept. 2, 2005, here is what is required to get the standard scripts installed with the Radmind Assistant 0.9.6 running under 10.4.x  with iHook installed;

1. Issue the command;

sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LogoutHook /etc/logout.hook

to create a link to the iHook logout hook - and if you want login by a 'radmind' local user to trigger a full RADMIND issue the command;

sudo defaults write com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /etc/login.hook

to create the required links to the iHook login hook.

2. The /etc/radmind.defaults file currently supplied with Radmind Assistant 0.9.6 has 3 bugs...

a) Delete the last line that reads;

'exit 0'

b) Remove the 'switches' from the variables TLSLEVEL and SERVER;

To do this, go to the section labelled &quot;radmind-specific defaults&quot; in /etc/radmind.defaults

Edit the file at this point to read as follows for the first two variables;

TLSLEVEL=&quot;`defaults read $ra_domain tlslevel 2&gt;/dev/null || echo ${TLSLEVEL}
| awk '{ print $2 }'`&quot;

previously;

TLSLEVEL=&quot;-w `defaults read $ra_domain tlslevel 2&gt;/dev/null || echo ${TLSLEVEL}
| awk '{ print $2 }'`&quot;

and;

SERVER=&quot;`defaults read $ra_domain radmindhost 2&gt;/dev/null || echo ${SERVER}
| awk '{ print $2 }'`&quot;

previously;

SERVER=&quot;-h `defaults read $ra_domain radmindhost 2&gt;/dev/null || echo ${SERVER}
| awk '{ print $2 }'`&quot;

Several users have been confused by  the comments at the head of the radmind.defaults file that refers to the fact that any edits to this file don't work if you are using the Radmind Assistant unless some 'defaults' setting is changed'. I don't think there has been full information provided on exactly what this means, especially as it doesn't seem to preclude things working.

Also - I originally tried getting things to work by changing the other references at the head of the file from AUTHLEVEL to TLSLEVEL, but in the end I changed them back again and it still worked.

       ktcheck - verify and download command file and transcripts

SYNOPSIS
       ktcheck  [-inrV]  [  -q | -v  ]  [  -c checksum ] [ -K command-file ] [
       -h host ] [ -p port ] [ -w auth-level ] [ -x ca-pem-file ]  [  -y cert-
       pem-file ] [ -z private-key-file ]


DESCRIPTION
       ktcheck  verifies a client's command file with the radmind server host.
       The command file is downloaded from host if it is missing  or  has  the
       wrong  size.   With  the  -c  option, checksums are also used to verify
       files.

       Reading the command file line-by-line, ktcheck  verifies  each  command
       file  and  transcript listed, downloading it from host if it is missing
       or out of date.  ktcheck ignors blank lines and comments ( lines start-
       ing with '#' ).  Included command files are read are verified using the
       same method.

       Each special file listed in the command file is converted into a  tran-
       script  line  in special.T with information provided by host.  See rad-
       mind(8) for details of the STAT command.

       If checksuming is turned on, the special transcript is  verified  using
       the  checksum  and  file  size.  If either are wrong, the special tran-
       script is updated.  If checksuming is turned  off,  the  special  tran-
       script is always updated.

       Files  updated  by ktcheck must be regular files and the user must have
       access to modify them.

       When run with the -n option, ktcheck verifies but never  downloads  the
       command files or transcripts.  A tempory special.T is created for veri-
       fication and is removed on exit.


OPTIONS
       -c checksum        enables checksuming.

       -i                 force output line buffering.

       -h host            specifies the radmind server, by default radmind.

       -K command         specifies  a  command  file,  by  default  /var/rad-
                          mind/client/command.K.

       -n                 no files modified.

       -p port            specifies a port, by default 6662.

       -q                 suppress all messages.

       -r                 use  random  seed file $RANDFILE if that environment
                          variable  is   set,   $HOME/.rnd   otherwise.    See
                          RAND_load_file(3o).

       -V                 displays  the  version  of  ktcheck, a list  of sup-
                          ported checksumming algorithms in  descending  order
                          of preference and then exits.

       -v                 displays communication with the radmind server.

       -w auth-level      TLS  authorization level, by default 0.  0 = no TLS,
                          1 = server verification, 2 = server and client veri-
                          fication.

       -x ca-pem-file     Certificate   authority's   public  certificate,  by
                          default /var/radmind/cert/ca.pem.

       -y cert-pem-file   Client's public certificate,  by  default  /var/rad-
                          mind/cert/cert.pem.

       -z private-key-file
                          Client's   private   key,   by   default   /var/rad-
                          mind/cert/cert.pem.


FILES
       /var/radmind/client/command.K
                          name of the default command file.

       special.T          name of the special transcript.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The open source tool called Tripwire is a host-based intrusion detection system. It is not so much concerned with detecting intrusion attempts at the periphery of a computing system (as in Network intrusion detection systems), but rather looks for and reports on the resultant changes of state in the computing system under observation.

Intruders usually leave traces of their activities (change system state). Tripwire looks for these by monitoring key attributes of files that should not change, including binary signature, size, expected change of size, etc. - and reporting its findings.
While useful for intrusion detection it can also be used for many other purposes such as integrity assurance, change management, policy compliance, and more.

Many techniques used for host-based intrusion detection were entirely or in part pioneered by Tripwire. In many senses recent efforts at managing security on computers, such as the Trusted Computing Group Trusted Platform Module are extensions of these ideas and techniques wrapped up in a piece of silicon that runs external to the CPU and is thus harder to crack.

Radmind goes beyond the general Tripwire by allowing you to reverse changes instead of only notifying the administrator. To fail tripwire means that something changed without the administrator's knowledge.

== Overview ==

'''''Peeves''''' the Poltergeist is not a ghost, but a Spirit of Chaos, who has never been alive, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=67 according to the author]. He can carry, throw, and drop things, loosen screws, and chew gum. When he is visible, he looks like a little man with wicked, dark eyes, a wide mouth, and a pointed hat; he is always seen in mid-air.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Peeves is first mentioned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Friar|the Fat Friar]], the Hufflepuff house ghost, as the First Year students are standing in the anteroom awaiting their Sorting. Evidently the Fat Friar felt that Peeves ought to attend the Entrance Feast.

Peeves first appears when the Gryffindor first-years are finding their way to the dormitory. He is throwing walking sticks at them, and in the end dumps a load of them on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville's]] head. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]] comments that the only being in the school that Peeves is afraid of is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|the Bloody Baron]], the Slytherin house ghost. It is mentioned elsewhere in the book that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] has some amount of control over him.

It is mentioned that running into Peeves on the way to class when you are late would make you much later; not only would he steer you wrong, but he would play tricks on you, pull rugs out from under your feet, and sneak up behind you and grab your nose.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], having seen Harry's diving catch before his first flying lesson, is looking for a private place to introduce him to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Oliver Wood|Oliver Wood]], the empty classroom she ends up in is occupied by Peeves, who is writing rude words on the chalkboard. Ordered out by McGonagall, Peeves swears as he leaves.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is challenged to a Wizard's Duel by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and Neville end up going to the Trophy Room, where they are almost caught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]]. As they are retreating from Filch, they run into Peeves, who sounds the alarm. Peeves follows them to a locked door which Hermione opens, and then for no real reason does not tell Filch that the students are behind the door. 

Harry suggests that the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|troll]] that is reported in the dungeons on Hallowe'en might have been let in by Peeves as a joke.

When Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] are headed for Hagrid's hut to take [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Norbert|Norbert]] up to his meeting with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Charlie Weasley|Charlie]]'s friends, they are held up by Peeves, who is playing tennis against the wall of the entrance hall.

Peeves almost discovers Harry, Ron, and Hermione when they are making their way to the trap door under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|invisibility cloak]], but Harry scares him away by pretending to be the Bloody Baron.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When Harry is being written up by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]] for dripping mud in the castle, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]] convinces Peeves to drop a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Disappearing Cabinets|Vanishing Cabinet]] immediately over Filch's office to distract him. This allows Harry to look around Filch's office unobserved, and spot Filch's Kwikspell letter. Filch is so mortified by this discovery of Harry's that he lets Harry go with a warning.

At Nick's Deathday Party, Peeves teases [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]] to the point that she leaves, crying.

Shortly after Harry discovers the Petrified body of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]] and the injured ghost of Nearly Headless Nick, Peeves happens across the three of them and raises the alarm. Peeves thereafter taunts Harry whenever he sees him, accusing him musically of having something to do with the attacks, complete with a little dance routine.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class is on its way to the Staff Room to practice dealing with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|Boggart]], they happen upon Peeves who is busily stuffing gum into a keyhole. While Peeves is usually slightly respectful towards teachers, he shows no respect for Lupin, instead singing about &quot;Loony, loopy, Lupin.&quot;. Professor Lupin sends him away with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Waddiwasi|a spell]] that fires the chewing gum up Peeves' nose, thus earning Lupin the respect of the entire class.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Fat Lady|The Fat Lady]]'s portrait is destroyed, it is Peeves who reports to Professor Dumbledore that the damage was done by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. Characteristically, Peeves does this in the most sensational way possible.

We see him again in passing as Harry and Hermione are making their way back to the Hospital Wing after Sirius' departure; Peeves is then on his way to observe the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]]'s Kiss being administered. As usual, he is going where he can make the most trouble.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Peeves' role in this book is relatively minor. When the students arrive, he is floating near the ceiling of the Entrance Hall, dropping water balloons on their heads; he claims that this is not harmful to them because with the downpour outside, they are already soaked, and a little more water shouldn't hurt them. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] shoos him away. At the Entrance Feast, Nearly Headless Nick tells Harry, Ron, and Hermione that there almost wasn't a feast, as Peeves, upset at being uninvited from the feast, had run amok in the kitchen, almost panicking the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elves]] preparing it.

Around the Christmas holidays, the suits of armor were enchanted to sing Christmas carols of which they only knew half the words. Peeves was known to inhabit the armor and sing rude versions of the songs by filling in the gaps with lyrics of his choosing.

When Harry is returning to Gryffindor Tower from the prefects' bathroom, having solved the riddle of the Golden Egg, he carefully checks the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]] to see where Peeves is, before setting out; he notes that Peeves is bouncing around the trophy room. When Harry gets stuck in the trick step and drops the egg, the sound brings Filch to investigate; Filch immediately assumes that Peeves had stolen the egg from one of the Champions.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

When Harry receives detention from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]] and is given a note to take to Professor McGonagall, he walks straight into Peeves without noticing. As Harry continues to McGonagall's study, Peeves stays alongside, taunting him.

Harry leaves the dormitory to send off a letter by Owl Post. On his way to the Owlery, he is warned by Nearly Headless Nick that Peeves is up ahead by the archway with the bust of Paracelsus, preparing a joke. Harry asks if the joke involves dropping the bust of Paracelsus on someone's head. Nick says that, funnily enough, it does, and that he is off to find the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/The Bloody Baron|Bloody Baron]] to see if he can put a stop to it. Harry takes a different route to the Owlery.

A short while later, horrible weather keeps the students in at break. Peeves is floating overhead in the room, flicking ink balls at the students when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Angelina Johnson|Angelina]] arrives to tell Harry and Ron that the Quidditch team has been re-formed. Peeves manages to hit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Katie Bell|Katie Bell]] with an ink ball, and she starts throwing things at him. As the bell rings, Peeves dumps an entire bottle of ink over Katie's head.

Ron and Hermione, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]], are called upon to supervise the decorating of the castle for Christmas. Ron tells Harry later that stringing tinsel is considerably more difficult when Peeves is on the other end trying to strangle you with it.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George Weasley]] have come to the conclusion that their final year of school is not particularly useful to them, and with the departure of Dumbledore, they no longer feel a need to keep their mischievous nature in check. Immediately after Easter break, they create a swamp in one of the corridors. On being caught by Professor Umbridge, they [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Accio|Summon]] their brooms, and, instructing Peeves to &quot;Give her hell!&quot;, depart. Peeves salutes as they leave.

Peeves' activity now doubles; Harry sees him wreaking havoc all over the school, and sees the other teachers not only ignoring, but occasionally helping Peeves in his ongoing activities.

Harry is misled into believing that Sirius is being tortured by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. In order to confirm that, he decides that he must use Umbridge's fireplace to communicate with Sirius, and of course he will need a distraction. Ron volunteers to tell Umbridge that Peeves is smashing up the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Transfiguration|Transfiguration]] Department. Unfortunately this fails, as Umbridge has just received a report that Peeves is busy inking the eyepieces of all the telescopes in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Astronomy|Astronomy]] classroom, and promptly arranges for the capture of Ron, Harry, and Harry's lookouts Hermione, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]].

After Dumbledore retrieves Umbridge from captivity with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]], and after she recovers, she attempts to sneak out of the school. Peeves, however, chases after her, whacking her retreating backside alternately with a bag of chalk and a walking stick.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Peeves is seen guarding a door, saying that he will only allow people who have set their own pants on fire to pass. Harry takes a longer route to bypass the door, but we later see Neville, in the dormitory, changing his charred trousers for new ones.

When Harry, looking for someone to take to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s Christmas party, decides to invite Luna Lovegood, Peeves overhears and promptly tells the entire school.

Ron is somehow poisoned on his birthday, and ends up in the Hospital Wing. Harry, Hermione, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] visit him, but leave to make room for his family when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr.]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] arrive. Harry and Hermione are discussing a conversation between Dumbledore and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]] that Hagrid had overheard, and in order to retain secrecy, stop when they see Peeves float by.

Harry, wondering about where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] is spending all his time, hits upon the idea of setting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] to tail him. When he calls Kreacher, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] arrives also, as they are apparently fighting over Kreacher having insulted Harry in front of Dobby. Peeves, who is always in favour of chaos, also appears, and is egging them on. Harry, to avoid drawing attention to their arrival, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Langlock|shuts Peeves up]], whereupon he angrily flies away.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

It is mentioned that as Harry and Luna Lovegood make their way from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]] to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ravenclaw House|Ravenclaw tower]] under the Invisibility Cloak, Harry is most afraid of running into Peeves. Luckily, they avoid him.

Peeves actually enters this book at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle at Hogwarts]], near the end of the book. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] summons him to aid in the defence of the school. During the battle itself, he soars above the fray, dropping things (notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Snargaluff|Snargaluff pods]]) on Death Eaters.

Once the battle is won, we can hear him in the distance, singing a victory song: &quot;''We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter's the one. Now [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldy]]'s gone mouldy, so now lets have fun!''&quot; Hearing Peeves' song after the victory, Ron comments that it really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing.

== Strengths ==

As a poltergeist, Peeves is able to move things and people. He is effectively uncontrollable and invulnerable, as he does not have any physical body.

== Weaknesses ==

Peeves is apparently afraid of the Bloody Baron. No explanation for this is given, but this fact proves useful to Percy Weasley when he is trying to lead the Gryffindor first-year students to their dormitory, and later to Harry, when he, Ron, and Hermione are trying to reach the chamber of the Philosopher's Stone.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Peeves' main joy is to create chaos, and he responds to other characters only in ways that will contribute to the chaos. He will sometimes follow direct orders given to him by senior staff (notably Professor Dumbledore and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]) and those who can injure him (notably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]]). He has only twice been known to take instructions from students and only once knowingly: in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 16|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], Harry instructed Peeves to leave the area and not to return that night, while pretending to be The Bloody Baron from under his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|invisibility cloak]]. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 29|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Fred and George instructed him to give Professor Umbridge a hard time, and Peeves was glad to oblige.

In ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', we learn that Peeves is only afraid of the Bloody Baron, the Slytherin House ghost, and that Dumbledore has some control over him. We will see later that while Dumbledore can control him to a certain extent, he remains as disrespectful to Dumbledore as to everyone else – when Dumbledore is interrogating him about the damage to the Fat Lady's portrait in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', Peeves answers correctly, but with no apparent respect for Dumbledore. It appears that Professor McGonagall has perhaps the same amount of control, as, in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', he accepts her order to stop dropping water balloons on the arriving students.

When Peeves drops the Vanishing Cabinet directly over Argus Filch's office, in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', we learn that Filch wants Peeves out of the castle. We see this again when Filch is taking Harry to Dolores Umbridge's office in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''; Filch, with evident satisfaction about the changes that will be taking place with the change of Headmaster, lists the eviction of Peeves as one of the things that he is looking forward to. We actually gather that Filch is perpetually upset with Peeves as early as the first book, though he doesn't say so directly.

== Analysis ==

There has been a great deal of discussion of the nature of Peeves, and whether, as is said at several points, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] actually can control him. In an interview, the author has compared Peeves to the stubborn plumbing common in older houses; temperamental, and while nobody can make it behave, Dumbledore is like the elder resident who knows how to coerce it into sufficiently good operation for the needs at hand.

One theory that seems reasonable is that Peeves is the natural result of having so many adolescent wizards in a single location. Poltergeist activity is often believed to be seen in the vicinity of adolescents, particularly females; it is possible that Peeves is the embodiment of the accumulated polter energy of the several hundred young wizards in Hogwarts.

It is certainly true that Peeves' activity was greater in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] when Umbridge was causing turmoil in the earlier part of the year, and considerably greater when Dumbledore was out of the castle in the later part of that book; but there did not seem to be extra activity on Peeves' part in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] when Dumbledore was suspended as Headmaster. It is possible that the level of Peeves' activity is directly related to the dissatisfaction level of the students, rather than by the headmaster directly. It is entirely possible that Peeves can only be removed from the school when everyone in it is satisfied with the way things are going, and that is extremely unlikely to ever happen.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

While Peeves is apparently fond of chaos, and will generally act to increase the confusion, he plainly is fond of his home and will tend to act to defend it. Professor McGonagall seemingly understands this, as in the preparations for the defence of Hogwarts, she sends Filch to find Peeves, and apparently gives instructions for the defence. In the battle itself, Peeves is clearly in his element, having a fine time bombing the invading Death Eaters with Snargaluff pods and other dangerous plants. It is interesting to note that, fond as he is of chaos, he does not knowingly act against the defenders of Hogwarts.

'''A topic that wouldn't be taught as a serious class should be excluded'''

* &quot;If ... you can take a class in the topic as a student, then it's an instructional guide. ... &quot;How to repair your car&quot; would count. &quot;How to play minesweeper like a pro&quot; would not.&quot;
*&quot;If any public school, college, or univeristy teaches the subject as a for-credit course, then ... that ... would be a wikibook. That would include how to program video games, but would not include how to play them.&quot;
* &quot;The purpose of Wikibooks is to host works which constitute a curriculum of textbooks from Kindergarten through the university level. The cookbook ... qualifies, since such courses are taught.&quot;

This is a place to vote, and even has a current poll going on, but it says &quot;please do not vote yet&quot; and calls this a first-draft page.  How about we change that so that people understand that they can currently vote and that this place really works?  --[[User:Cromwellt|Cromwellt]]|[[User talk:Cromwellt|talk]] 06:57, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

Use graphical methods to represent distance travelled, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration. 

Find the distance travelled by calculating the area under the graph. 

Use the slope of a displacement-time graph to find velocity and of a distance-time graph to find speed. 

Use the slope of a velocity-time graph to find acceleration.

Explain motion due to a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction. 


I have removed the parts regarding vector notation and calculus. Both of these are outside of the scope of an A-level physics course (somewhat surprisingly) and leaving them in will likely confuse students. I have moved the text here. Don't worry, you haven't typed in vain, Mechanics 1 in &quot;A-level mathematics&quot; would find your contributions useful. --Krackpipe 10:36, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

The derivation of the above formulae, uses the basic definitions of velocity and acceleration, with the help of calculus.

By definiton,

 # &lt;math&gt;\  \vec v = d\vec x / dt &lt;/math&gt;
 # &lt;math&gt;\  \vec a=d\vec v/dt    &lt;/math&gt;
 # &lt;math&gt;\ \vec v d \vec v / d \vec x = \vec a &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \vec x &lt;/math&gt; is position vector (from an axis), &lt;math&gt; \vec v &lt;/math&gt; is velocity, and &lt;math&gt; \vec a &lt;/math&gt; is accleration

Assuming &lt;math&gt; \vec a &lt;/math&gt; to be constant, since the above formulae are defined under that condition only,

== V-T Relation ==

&lt;math&gt;\ \vec a dt = d\vec v &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \int_{0}^{t} \vec a\, dt = \int_{v_i}^{v_f}  d \vec v &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ \vec at = \vec v_f - \vec v_i &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\ \vec v_f = \vec v_i + \vec a t &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \vec v_f &lt;/math&gt; is final velocity, and &lt;math&gt; \vec v_i &lt;/math&gt; is initial velocity.

== X - T Relation ==

&lt;math&gt;\ d \vec x / d \vec t = /vec v &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ d \vec x =  \vec v dt &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ d \vec x = (\vec v_i + \vec a t )dt &lt;/math&gt;


The last step was got by substituting the result from the previous derivation. Intergrating,



&lt;math&gt;  \int_{x_i}^{x_f} dx =  \int_{0}^{t} (\vec v_i + \vec a t ), dt &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;  \vec x_f - \vec x_f = \vec v_i t + 1/2 \vec a t &lt;/math&gt;


== V-X Relation ==


&lt;math&gt;\ \vec v d \vec v / d \vec x = \vec a &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ \vec v d \vec v = \vec a d \vec x &lt;/math&gt;

Intergrating

&lt;math&gt;\ \int_{v_i}^{v_f} \vec v, d \vec v = \int_{x_i}^{x_f} \vec a, d \vec x &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ 1/2(v_f ^2 - v_i ^2) = \vec a . (x_f - x_i) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ v_f ^2 = v_i ^ 2 + 2 \vec a . (x_f - x_i) &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt; x_f - x_i &lt;/math&gt; is nothing but the '''displacement''' of the body, and is substituted by the term &lt;math&gt; \vec s &lt;/math&gt;. So the final formula is,

&lt;math&gt;\ v_f ^2 - v_i ^2 = 2 \vec a . \vec s &lt;/math&gt;

One very important thing that must be noted here is that the terms &lt;math&gt; v_f ^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v_i ^2 &lt;/math&gt; are ''' not ''' the vector quantities, but the magnitude of the vector whole squared. Technically, it is: &lt;math&gt; v_f ^2 = \vec v_f . \vec v_f &lt;/math&gt; , i.e the dot product. Another thing to note is that the term &lt;math&gt; 2 \vec a . \vec s &lt;/math&gt; is again the dot product of the acceleration and the displacement.

and

From the equation for velocity, and the two equations for acceleration, you can derive '''the equations of motion'''. These equations can be used to solve problems that seem very complicated at first. The equations are:

* &lt;math&gt; \vec v_f = \vec v_i + \vec a t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; v_f^2= v_i^2+ 2 \vec a . \vec s&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \vec s = \vec v_i t+{\frac {1}{2}} \vec a t^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; |s| = \frac {( |v_i|+ |v_f|)}{2} \times t&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\vec a&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration, &lt;math&gt; \vec s&lt;/math&gt; is displacement, which can also be written as &lt;math&gt; \vec x_f - \vec x_i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \vec x_i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec x_f &lt;/math&gt; being the initial and final position vectors of the body respectively,  &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time, &lt;math&gt;\vec v_i&lt;/math&gt; is initial velocity and &lt;math&gt; \vec v_f&lt;/math&gt; is final velocity. Note that these equations only work when an object is moving in a straight line and has constant acceleration.

Note that in the 3rd equation the '''dot product''' of the two vectors &lt;</text>

'''Gluten-Free Breakfast Waffles''' - These waffles are surprisingly good for a gluten-free recipe.  They are similar to the [[Cookbook:Breakfast Waffles|breakfast waffles made with wheat flour]] except the [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] is replaced with [[Cookbook:Wheat-Free Baking Mix|Wheat-Free Baking Mix]].  They are simple and predictable to make.  The batter can be made in about 15 minutes, so they are suitable as a last-minute addition to a breakfast.  They are made fluffy by beating the egg whites separately and folding them in as the last step.

The amount of milk is tailored to  [http://www.bobsredmill.com/catalog/index.php?action=showdetails&amp;product_ID=405|&quot;Bob's Red Mill Wheat Free Biscuit &amp; Baking Mix&quot;] which is a blend of non-wheat flours and some gluten-free binders.  You could use any [[Cookbook:Wheat-Free Baking Mix|Wheat-Free Baking Mix]] provided it is actually gluten-free (and not just wheat-free), but you might have to adjust the amount of milk to get the right consistency.

==Ingredients==
*3 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]], separated
*1 3/4 cups (420ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1/2 lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Wheat-Free Baking Mix|Wheat-Free Baking Mix]]
*2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*3 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1/4 cup (2 oz) [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]

==Procedure==
#[[Cookbook:Mix|Mix]] egg yolks and milk. 
#Add the wheat-free baking mix, baking powder, sugar, salt and [[Cookbook:Mixing|mix well]]. 
#Add the oil. 
#[[Cookbook:Beat|Beat]] the egg whites until stiff and then [[Cookbook:Fold|fold]] into the batter.

It is possible that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] was planning to use this jinx on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James Potter]] when he was being picked on in the scene that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] witnessed in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 28|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. However, as Snape never got even one syllable of the jinx spoken, we cannot be sure.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Harry finds this curse in the ''Advanced Potion-Making'' book that was previously owned by the Half-Blood Prince. There is no description of its effects, the only notation is &quot;For enemies&quot;. Out of desperation, Harry used it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]], as Malfoy was preparing to hit Harry with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus]] curse. It apparently causes the caster's wand to act as a very long knife, thus resulting in the target getting huge cuts across their body. The way the caster moves their wand when saying the incantation decides how the cuts are made. Since Harry's hand was shaking badly as he pointed it at Malfoy, Draco got large cuts across his chest and face. Professor Snape, summoned to this duel by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]]'s screams, manages to close the cuts, and then takes Malfoy to the Hospital Wing, saying that he will need essence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dittany|Dittany]] to heal them up all the way. This evidently works, because when we see Malfoy again, there is no mention of scarring.

Snape used this spell on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/George Weasley|George Weasley]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], cutting his ear off. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] remarks that as his ear was removed by Dark magic, it will be impossible to grow it back. Mentioning that it was Snape who did it, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]] remarks that &quot;''Sectumsempra'' was always a speciality &lt;!-- sic --&gt;of Snape's.&quot;

== Analysis ==

The spell is said to create never-healing cuts, yet Snape was able to partially heal Draco with an unnamed spell. It is reasonable to suppose that since Snape either invented, or did a significant amount of research into, the Sectumsempra jinx, he more than likely came up with, or discovered, a counter spell for it.

#Given that Snape was revealed to be the Half-Blood Prince, was it Snape that created this spell?

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

Much later in the book, it will be revealed that Snape had been attempting to use this jinx on the Death Eater then targeting George, to remove or at least disable his wand arm. His hitting George and removing his ear is accidental.

Nothing in the books tells us who created this spell. It is true that Snape recorded it in his textbook, but we don't know whether he learned it from someone else (for instance Voldemort), or originated it himself. Internal evidence in the series suggests, weakly, that Snape recorded what someone else had told him.

== Overview ==

A '''''Muggle''''' is a non-magical human. Most Muggles don't know about magic or any of the wizarding world.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

For most wizards, Muggles are regarded with fondness. Poor, non-magical people, how ever do they survive without magic? Some wizards are bemused or intrigued by the techniques and gadgets that Muggles use to get around their lack of magic. For a few, though, Muggles are inferior, and they and anyone descended from them should be exterminated. This long-standing belief in what is called [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pureblood|blood purity]], apparently championed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]] over a thousand years before our story opens, is being used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] as a recruiting and control tool.

== Analysis ==

The Dark belief in the inferiority of Muggles conveniently disregards the facts that many of the strongest wizards alive, including Voldemort himself, are children of Wizard / Muggle marriages, and that the top grades in Harry's year, for all the first six years of Harry's high school career, have been won by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]], the daughter of two Muggles. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], another strong wizard, is tarred by the same brush, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother]] was a child of Muggles. This belief also ignores the fact that scions of older Wizarding families like the Longbottoms sometimes are not terribly powerful wizards.

Despite their fondness for Muggles, many wizards do feel that they are somehow diminished by their lack of magic; in fact, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] remarks, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|the first chapter of the first book]], that the Dursleys &quot;are the greatest load of Muggles you'll ever come across.&quot; Many Muggles who are aware of the Wizarding world, such as the Dursleys, chose to ignore the magical community, denying the evidence even if it is plainly clear that there is magic happening all around them. In the context of Professor McGonagall's remark, the comment does not directly refer to the Dursleys' denial of magic, as that has not yet been observed by Professor McGonagall. One must wonder whether McGonagall meant &quot;the worst sort of Muggle&quot;, or &quot;the worst sort who happen to also be Muggles.&quot;

We will learn that the belief of Wizard superiority to Muggles is very widespread; even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], as a youth, envisioned a world in which Muggles accepted the benevolent rule of wizards.

=== The Wizarding World and the Muggle World ===

Part of the job of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] is keeping the Wizarding world concealed from Muggles. When a Muggle sees something related to the Wizarding world, the Ministry sends out wizards who [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|adjust the Muggles' memories]] to eliminate their recollection of the event. Among the very few exceptions are those Muggles like the Prime Minister, who we see in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], who must assist in the Wizarding world's interaction with Muggles; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squibs]]; and the Muggle parents and siblings of half-blood or Muggle-born witches and wizards. The most dangerous near-breach of this concealment on record, according to ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' by &quot;Newt Scamander&quot;, occurred when a Common Welsh Green [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dragon|dragon]] swooped over a group of sunbathers at Ilfracombe in 1932. A vacationing Wizarding family prevented catastrophe by performing the greatest number of simultaneous Memory Charms in recorded history on the residents of the town.

Why it is important that the Muggles remain unaware of the Wizarding world is never fully explained. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 3|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] explains to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] that if the Muggles knew that there were wizards living among them, they would expect the Wizards to solve all their problems using magic. The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, agreed to in 1692, codified this withdrawal of the Wizarding World from the Muggles. At the time, according to Newt Scamander, the Statute was considered a means of protecting Wizards from the Muggles' fear of magic and its practitioners. One aspect of this Statute is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]], which Harry falls afoul of on three occasions.
