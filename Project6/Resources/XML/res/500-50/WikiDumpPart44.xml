      <text xml:space="preserve">A Lone Elephant Attack is considered a very safe and cautious strategy and it was by far the most popular during the early years of Arimaa.  As the name suggests, this attack requires only a single piece while the rest of the army stays behind.  If both players employ the Lone Elephant Attack, it is known as a Dual Lone Elephant game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just want to introduce myself to the community. My name is Wil Nusser, and I am somewhere between &quot;amateur astronomer&quot; and &quot;astronomy enthusiast.&quot; I hope that my contribution (first draft of &quot;What Will Happen to the SS in the Future&quot;) proves useful in this project, and I look forward to contributing more to this and other projects in the future.

As I posted this page via BlackBerry, I was unable to include a few things I would've liked. Some images:

Planetary nebula&lt;br&gt;
Nuclear fusion

Also, I read only a few small selections before posting. Afterwards, I read more, and some of it (in particular, the pages on The Sun) suggested that a slight increase in the level of sophistication may be appropriate. For example, in the section on &quot;An Unstable Ending,&quot; I considered discussing the concept of helium flash, but ultimately rejected this in the interest of keeping things at about a third-grade level. (Plus, this would probably necessitate a further tangient on the CNO cycle. Perhaps a box would be appropriate?) Likewise, I did not discuss the role of electrical forces as resistance to fusion. While these are important concepts, I did not deem them vital to the discussion, but I am sure others may disagree.

I'd also like to include a box on stellar evolution, covering neutron stars

In any case, my article is there, for others to edit as they see fit. Feel free to contact me via email at phoenixshade@hotmail.com .</text>

== THROWING INJURIES &amp; SLAP LESIONS ==

DAVID V RAJAN  &amp; CLEMENT JOSEPH
Sports Injury and Arthroscopy Clinic, Coimbatore.

Sports that require overhead arm action (e.g. volleyball, swimming, tennis) and throwing (eg. baseball, cricket, javelin) place significant demands on the shoulder. Approach to the athletic shoulder is quite different from that of normal shoulders. More than 50% of the force of throwing is generated from lower limbs and trunk rotations. The shoulder is the main link in this kinetic chain.1,2 This article discusses the pathomechanisms involved in the problematic overhead shoulder and the prevention and management of superior labral lesions, which put an end to the athletic career.

KINEMATICS 

The throwing action is divided into many phases. In the wind-up phase, the player gets ready with build-up of potential energy. During the cocking phase the player takes the arm high and back (abduction and external rotation). At this stage, the anterior capsule is stressed and rotator cuff, especially subscapularis is very active. The acceleration phase is from the cock-up position to the ball release. Though significant forces are generated in this phase, the shoulder is minimally stressed. The most violent phase is the deceleration phase, which is the arm follow-through, after the ball release. The arm is slowed down by the eccentric contraction (contraction while lengthening) of cuff muscles. During this phase the posterior capsule is stressed to maximum and is responsible for the reactive hypertrophy of the capsule resulting in contracture and loss of internal rotation. 3

PATHOMECHANISM

Two schools of thought exist regarding the basic pathomechanism of the disabled shoulder. The first one regards the stretched out anterior capsule as the primary pathology.4 The second one regards the acquired posterior capsular contracture resulting in a glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) as the primary pathology. The latter is gaining widespread acceptance currently.3,5 

Posterior Capsule tightness
	Significant internal rotation loss occurs in dominant shoulders when the players are not doing proper stretching exercises. With the rotations of humeral head, the capsule and glenohumeral ligaments also move accordingly. During external rotation, the tight band of posteroinferior capsule comes to lie inferior to the humeral head and pushes the glenohumeral rotation point posteriorly and superiorly(fig2). This altered resting position clears the greater tuberosity off the posterosuperior glenoid and allows excessive external rotation. Because of the excessive external rotation, the long head of biceps starts to pull on the superior labrum from a posterior direction. This altered force vector of the biceps results in avulsion of superior labrum resulting in SLAP lesions.3,5,6 







ROTATOR CUFF PATHOLOGY

As we have already seen, the stress during eccentric contraction of rotator cuff can lead to fiber failure.3 In addition, the excessive external rotation of humeral head causes twisting of the cuff fibers causing an additional torsional overload.3 In extreme external rotation the articular side of posterosuperior cuff can impinge against the posterosuperior glenoid resulting in fraying and partial tears (Internal impingement).7,8 All these mechanisms are involved in rotator cuff pathology and in athletic shoulders most of the rotator cuff problems lie on the articular side of the cuff, hence subacromian injections and acromioplasty rarely help. 

BICEPS TENDON
Lesions of the long head of biceps could be minor fraying, partial or complete tears and subluxations. Subluxation is demonstrated by abducting and external rotating the arm while simultaneously palpating the tendon. 

SCAPULA

The scapula and associated muscles provide the platform for the shoulder function. A drooped and protracted shoulder (tennis shoulder) is commonly seen in overhead athletes, which is due to fatigue of scapular muscles and heaviness of the hypertrophied playing arm. The malpositioned scapula can lead to impingement pain (altered acromion position, reducing the subacromial space) coracoid pain (traction tendinitis of pectoralis minor).5 The scapula rhythm is observed as the athlete elevates both the arms. Winging or prominence of medial border also indicate scapular muscle imbalance The management consists of rehabilitation by strengthening, flexibility and plyometric exercises.1,2

NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEMS 

Mononeuropathies involving suprascapular nerve and nerve to latissimus dorsi are commonly seen. The suprascapular nerve can sustain injuries due to traction due to overhead activity or compression by a paralabral cyst arising from a labral tear. If the suprascapular nerve is compressed at suprascapular notch, both supraspinatus and infraspinatus will be affected and if compressed at spinoglenoid notch only infraspinatus is affected. Clinical diagnosis is by observation of wasting and weakness on isolated muscle strength testing.9

INSTABILITY
	Recurrent dislocations in the dominant shoulder preclude overhead athletic activity. Many an athlete have shoulders which are lax, but stable. Laxity (sign) should not be confused with instability (symptom). SLAP lesions can themselves create a pseudolaxity, which disappears after SLAP repair. Rarely a SLAP lesion occurs continous with a Bankart lesion. Gross anterior capsular laxity producing excessive external rotation (&gt;130 degrees) may need capsular plication.5 Any demonstrable anterior instability in a throwing athlete occurs as a tertiary phenomenon due to a tight posterior capsule and SLAP lesion.3

SLAP LESIONS
The labrum serves as an attachment point for capsule, glenohumeral ligaments and long head of biceps. It acts as a bumper and deepens the glenoid. The long head of biceps inserts into the supraglenoid tubercle as well as superior labrum. This biceps – superior labral complex is disturbed in sports as well as other injuries. These lesions were first described by Andrews10 and later classified by Snyder, who gave the acronym SLAP (Superior Labrum Anterior Posterior)11. The superior labrum- biceps complex exhibits normal anatomic variations that should be distinguished from tears. (Fig 3) 

Classification
Superior labral lesions are classified into four major subtypes (Fig 4) and few other less common patterns also have been recognized.

Type I - fraying of the superior labrum
Type II - avulsion of the superior labrum off the glenoid. 
Type III - buckethandle tear of the superior labrum
Type IV The buckethandle tear of the superior labrum extends into the biceps anchor.
Other types include a combination of SLAP with Bankart lesion (Type V) and extension of superior labral tear into the anterosuperior capsule (Type VI).
 Fig. 4
Mechanisms of Injury
               The many varieties of lesions suggest that more than one mechanism is involved in producing these lesions.	
1.	Fall on outstretched hand. A fall with abducted and forward flexed arm can cause the humeral head to compress against the superior labrum
2.	Traction injury: Sudden inferior pulling of the arm as seen in water-skiing injuries can produce SLAP lesions14.
3.	Torsional Peel Back: In the cocking position (Abduction and Hyper-external rotation), the altered direction of pull of biceps tendon on the superior labrum can peel the superior labrum off the glenoid. This mechanism is also supported by recent biomechanical studies. This mechanism is responsible for the type II lesions seen in athletes.3,6,12
4.	Degeneration: It is common to find degenerative changes of superior labrum as well as long head of biceps in the elderly athletes. 

Diagnosis: 
The diagnosis of SLAP lesions is clinical. SLAP lesions can be missed in routine MRI and a normal MRI does not exclude a SLAP lesion. The sensitivity of an MRI can be improved by an MR arthrogram with intraarticular gadolinium. On the other hand no SLAP test is specific and considerable overlap exists between other conditions like cuff, biceps and AC joint pathology.

O’Brien test (active compression test): In this test the subject’s arm is forward flexed to 90o and adducted to 20o and internal rotated to maximum. The examiner places his hand over the forearm and applies a downward force and the patient is asked to resist it. The test is repeated with the forearm supinated. In a positive test, pain produced with pronated foream is reduced in supination.  Pain, which is unaltered with supination, indicates other pathology like AC joint arthritis.13

Jobe’s test: Initially described for instability, the pain produced in the abducted external rotated position is relieved by a posteriorly directed force (relocation maneuver) applied to the proximal humerus. This test is positive in posterior SLAP lesions16
Compression-rotation test: In this test, the shoulder is abducted to 900 and an axial compression force is applied by pushing the elbow and then the arm is rotated internally and externally. SLAP lesions produce pain, or crepitus with this maneuver.14
Anterior Slide Test (Kibler): With the subject’s hand on his hip, the examiner stabilizes scapula with one hand and applies a superiorly directed force to the elbow and the patient is asked to resist the force. Pain or click indicates a positive test.14
Kim’s Biceps Load Test:  With the subject supine, the arm is abducted to 120 degrees and elbow flexed to 90 and forearm pronated, the subject is asked to flex the elbow against the resistance. Pain indicates positive test. 15

PREVENTION
Having seen that the posterior capsular contracture being the root cause of SLAP lesions, most of them are preventable. There exists a stage of “SHOULDER-AT-RISK” in which the GIRD exists without any pathology. Posterior capsular stretching exercises (fig 6) at this stage will stop the progression to SLAP lesions. 3

MANAGEMENT
The basic principle of treatment depends on whether the biceps anchor is intact or not. If the biceps anchor is detached it has to be reattached. Preoperative stretching exercises for posterior capsule are advised. Rotations are examined under anaesthesia; gross loss of internal rotation (IR &lt; 250) may need selective posteroinferior capsulotomy at the end.5,16
Superior labral fraying in Type I lesions requires debridement alone. Avulsions of superior labrum (Type II) require reattachment of the superior labrum to the glenoid. This is accomplished by the placement of suture anchors into the glenoid and the repairing the labrum on to it. The glenoid and labral tissue are freshened before the repair. (Fig 5)

In type III lesions, the inner rim of the labrum is detached from the rest and the biceps’ attachment to the labrum is intact. All that is needed is excision of the buckethandle segment. But in Type IV lesions, the buckethandle tear extends into the biceps root. The management depends on the involvement of biceps root. If the tear involves less than 50% of the biceps root, it can be excised and if it is more than 50% the torn segment is repaired to the remaining tissue.                                                      .    



REHABILITATION 
	After SLAP repair, pendular exercises are started from 3rd day onwards. Sling is used for 3 weeks. Posterior capsular stretching is continued indefinitely. Flexion, extension, passive external rotation with arm at side and posterior capsule stretching (sleeper stretches) are started immediately. onwards. (Fig 6) External rotation in abduction is started from 4 – 6 weeks. Rotator cuff strengthening and biceps strengthening are started from 6th &amp; 8th weeks respectively. Rehabilitation of scapula muscles is also given importance. Gradual return to full overhead activity by 7 – 8 months is advised. 5,16

1837 Charles Wheatstone patents &quot;electric telegraph&quot;

1849 England to France telegraph cable goes into service -- and fails after 8 days.

1850 Morse patents &quot;clicking&quot; telegraph.

1851 England-France commercial telegraph service begins.  This one uses gutta-percha, and survives.

1858 August 18 - First transatlantic telegraph messages sent by the Atlantic Telegraph Co. The cable deteriorated quickly, and failed after 3 weeks.

1870 The trans-Atlantic message rate is increased to 20 words per minute.

1874 Baudot invents a practical Time Division Multiplexing scheme for telegraph.  Uses 5-bit codes &amp; 6 time slots -- 90 bps max. rate. Both Western Union and Murray would use this as the basis of multiplex telegraph systems.

1875 Typewriter invented.

1876 Alexander Graham Bell and Elisa Grey independently invent the telephone (although it may have been invented by Antonio Meucci as early as 1857)

1877 Bell attempts to use telephone over the Atlantic telegraph cable. The attempt fails.

1880 Oliver Heaviside's analysis shows that a uniform addition of inductance into a cable would produce distortionless transmission.

1883 Test calls placed over five miles of under-water cable.

1884 - San Francisco-Oakland gutta-percha cable begins telephone service.

1885 Alexander Graham Bell incorporated AT&amp;T

1885 James Clerk Maxwell predicts the existence of radio waves

1887 Heinrich Hertz verifies the existence of radio waves

1889 Almon Brown Strowger invents the first automated telephone switch

1895 Gugliemo Marconi invents the first radio transmitter/receiver

1901 Gugliemo Marconi transmits the first radio signal across the Atlantic
1901 Donald Murray links typewriter to high-speed multiplex system, later used by Western Union

1905 The first audio broadcast is made

1910 Cheasapeake Bay cable is first to use loading coils underwater

1911 The first broadcast license is issued in the US

1912 Hundreds on the Titanic were saved due to wireless

1915 USA transcontinental telephone service begins (NY-San Francisco).

1924 The first video signal is broadcast

1927 First commercial transatlantic radiotelephone service begins

1929 The CRT display tube is invented

1935 Edwin Armstrong invents FM

1939 The Blitzkrieg and WW II are made possible by wireless

1946 The first mobile radio system goes into service in St. Louis

1948 The transistor is invented

1950 Repeatered submarine cable used on Key West-Havana route.

1956 The first trans-Atlantic telephone cable, TAT-1, goes into operation. It uses 1608 vacuum tubes.

1957 The first artificial satellite, Sputnik goes into orbit

1968 The Carterphone decision allows private devices to be attached to the telephone

1984 The MFJ (Modification of Final Judgement) takes effect and the Bell system is broken up

1986 The first transAtlantic fiber optic cable goes into service

      <text xml:space="preserve">Do you think that this book should remain broad and conceptual, or that it should have say, stream ecology, ecology in the context of urban sprawl etcetera? Specifics like that are more conservation biology than ecology. But maybe there could be the odd box example of conservation biology and the ecology of specific biomes in specific places? I think I might have seen ecology text books have some of those examples in them without any comprehensive discussion of those topics, in boxes separated from the rest of the text. So anyway, what do you think?
I'm starting to think that stuff like SLOSS or fragmentation would need its' own &quot;Conservation Biology&quot; wikibook, but do you think that this conservation stuff should be mentioned here?
Thanks

:You are right to raise this question.   Conservation management is crucial to the future of plane Earth, and although the empirical approach can be used with a fair degree of success, it increasingly relies on experimental evidence.  Therefore, although conservation has been on the periphery of ecology as a subject, it should now be integrated into ecological thinking.  To this end I have started a section on applied ecology, with conservation management as the first subsection.  The aim is to elicit examples of conservation management systems that exemplify the application of six pillars of ecology. --[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 15:27, 19 January 2006 (UTC)
::Thats where that came from.  I think &quot;Applied Ecology&quot; is a good idea. Should it be a separate section or a new book? We can decide of course after you get it underway. The premise of this book in the beginning was just to get the basics out of the way, and the chapters reflect this; but clearly there is lots more that can be said and done in the field and I did earlier set up the idea of separate sections which you are now pushing forward. Great!   - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 17:26, 20 January 2006 (UTC)
::: My first idea was that it should be a separate book.  As you say, as it grows it may well be more useful to detach it.  As I see it the objective of Applied Ecology is to use ecological theory and principles to solve problems associated with intensive human use of the environment.  The following topics are distinct problem areas that are tackled by applying ecological principles on large scales; restorative and and mitigative habitat creation; conservation management; landscape architecture; water-treatment engineering based on wetland ecosystems; disease transmission through ecosystems; rehabilitation of rare species.  They broadly define the scope and of applied ecology as a subject and each one could be developed as the chapter of a book.  I will leave you to decide whether you would like applied ecology with this scope to be initiated in your book.--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 11:12, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
:Having looked more closely at Help:How to start a book and Wickibooks: Naming policy, I have decided that the content would, in the long run, best be handled editorially by starting a new book entitled Applied Ecology.--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 09:02, 22 January 2006 (UTC) 
== Page Renaming ==

I'm writing this book and will decide how and what pages are to be named. I'm not opposed to reviewing &quot;your&quot; convention and maybe applying it, but do not put stupid banners on the book modules - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 17:22, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

: I am happy to fit in with your convention--[[User:Denis Bellamy|Denis Bellamy]] 11:12, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

::You are writing this book at Wikibooks and Wikibooks policies apply to your book. Naming of this book is completely unconsistent and misleading. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:33, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Guess what? I checked and there is no &quot;Naming Policy&quot;; only suggestions. Anyway, it is a firmly held rule at Wikipedia (and I assume here also), that suggestions to changes on pages be placed on the discussion page of the article. Banners on article pages are only those intended to convey information to users/readers (whether contributing or not), such as warnings about lack of factual support, controversy, revelation of surprise endings, and the like. Your very obnoxious banners have only the effect of driving users away from reading the article/module material. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:23, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

::::Please do not assume that Wikipedia policies apply here. Wikibooks has its own [[WB:PAG]] page, though much of it is intentionally similar to Wikipedia. [[WB:NP]] has never become {{tl|enforced}}, but I suggest the renaming of [[Basic Ecology Contents]], [[Practical Ecology]], and [[Invasive Species Glossary]] to use &quot;Ecology:&quot; or &quot;Basic Ecology:&quot; like the other modules currently do.

:::No problem. I've always changed my pages in response to whatever style is currently in vogue. My objection is entirely with the tactics being used, especially by self-appointed enforcement police like McDerbeth.

::::Is the &quot;obnoxious banner&quot; a reference to {{tl|Cleanup-NC}}? I always put it on the module, not the talk page, because similar templates like {{tl1|Cleanup|''reason''}} and {{tl1|mergeto|''other module''}} almost always appear at the module, not the talk page. So I presently believe that {{tl|Cleanup-NC}} also belongs on that page. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:25, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

:::Sorry, although you are right, the practice is inconsistent, instructions or requests to editors/writers to do certain things with their text should be on the discussion page, just as any suggestions, requests, ideas, etc. would be. Banners on the module pages that are not intended for the user of the text (for example a student) tend to put the users off (&quot;There must be something wrong with this textbook, I'll go elsewhere for my learning experience&quot;); only makes sense. Also, while all are welcome to contribute, the fact is that only one or a very few people tend to excercise control over a particular texbook as necessary to actually get a book out the subject matter. As Basic Ecology is a book I am working on, I will not accept banners that are requesting something from me on the module page.  I do not mind them on the discussion page; but they are not part of the lesson that the module represents and I excercise my editorial right to move them. And while I do not seem to be having a problem with you and this issue, I do not appreciate a non-contributor like Derbeth suddenly taking over a textbook because he does not like how the modules are named and then attacking me, which is how this &quot;policy&quot; is being implemented. I think that approach is way out of line with Wikipedia (and certainly Wikibooks) philosophy.  - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 01:13, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

===More about renaming===

I would have to agree that the banners across the top of various pages can be very obnoxious and are jarring in term of people who are simply trying to read the content and don't care how the content is stored internally on the webserver.

From the perspective of administrating content on Wikibooks, it helps if there is some sort of consistant naming for a wikibook, although I'm opposed to the current policy that only permits one single possible naming method.  This helps mainly because tools like [[Special:prefixindex]] are available to help find content that has been &quot;lost&quot; due to links that have gone missing, or to help locate the &quot;parent&quot; module if you find a page in the orphan bin.  Far too much content has been lost and forgotten on Wikibooks simply because there are no links available to help find it in the first place.

As you have said marsh, this is something that should be done politely on the talk page first, where contributors are able to make their suggestionss first and give credit to those who are developing the content... not run rough over contributors because you may have a few stripes on your arm as an administrator.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:11, 29 March 2006 (UTC)


==Anyone here?==
Does anyone visit these pages anymore?  I (and my class) plan on making some significant contribution over the next semester and would like to discuss layout,  conception, etc with anyone still actively involved with the book.  Thanks.  --[[User:PaulWLepp|PaulWLepp]] 15:23, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

== Overview ==

'''''Kreacher''''' is the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house elf]] for the Black family.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Kreacher is first encountered when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] is brought into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]'s headquarters, at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12 Grimmauld Place]]. He resents the new inhabitants of the house that has been a pure-blood stronghold for a long time, and wages his own little psychological warfare on them. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] says that he has been shut up in the house for ten years, taking orders only from the mad [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Paintings|portrait]] of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Walburga Black|Sirius' mother]], and going rather mad himself. It is noted that as Sirius and the others are collecting Black family artifacts to throw out, Kreacher is stealing some of them and hiding them away.

When Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, and George]] are transported by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] to Grimmauld Place after their father is injured, Kreacher makes a very insulting comment. &quot;Is it true their father is dying?&quot; Sirius, outraged, shouts &quot;Out!&quot; at him, whereupon he vanishes and is not seen again for some days. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] wants to give him a Christmas present, a quilt, but cannot find him; Sirius says that he has a sort of nest under the boiler, and Hermione leaves the quilt there. Harry notes that many of the pictures that he had helped Sirius discard, including a disturbing one of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], are arranged around Kreacher's sleeping space. Eventually, Kreacher reappears; apparently he has been in the attic all this time.

Later on, when Harry tries to find out if his vision of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] being attacked at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Department of Mysteries]] is true, Kreacher says that his master is not home, and that Sirius will never return from the Department of Mysteries, making Harry believe that he must get to London immediately and try to save Sirius.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] arrives at Grimmauld Place, Kreacher laughs at him, telling him that Sirius is gone and won't be back. Dumbledore has to use rather forceful persuasion on Kreacher, but by doing so he learns that Sirius and the other Order members there present ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Kingsley Shacklebolt]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Alastor Moody]]), have gone off to the Ministry to rescue Harry. He also learns that the Death Eaters have learned about Harry's vulnerability to worry about Sirius because, when Sirius had dismissed Kreacher at Christmas, Kreacher had interpreted that as permission to leave the house, and he had gone to the only Black relative that he still respected: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]]. Though unable to reveal any of the secrets of the Order, or anything he was specifically forbidden to talk about by Sirius, he still was able to reveal that Harry cared extremely deeply about Sirius. Additionally, by injuring [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]], Kreacher was able to keep Sirius out of the way when Harry tried to reach him via the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo network]]. So when Harry spoke to Kreacher, Kreacher was able to lie to him without fear of being contradicted by Sirius.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

By the terms of Sirius' will, Harry has inherited Grimmauld Place and all its contents, including Kreacher. Professor Dumbledore summons Kreacher to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys' house]] to determine whether the inheritance is valid; if there is a charm preventing Harry from inheriting, Kreacher will not accept his orders. Harry's desperate order to Kreacher to shut up is effective, despite Kreacher's quite evident reluctance to accept orders from &quot;the Potter brat,&quot; proving that he, rather than Narcissa (Black) Malfoy or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix (Black) Lestrange]], has actually inherited. Harry then, at a loss for anything else for Kreacher to do, accepts Dumbledore's suggestion and sends him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchens.

Later, as Harry is the only person who believes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] is up to something, he sends Kreacher and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] to follow Malfoy and find out what he is doing. Kreacher's report is largely full of insults for Harry and compliments for Malfoy, but Dobby reports that Malfoy has been going to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Harry discovers that the mysterious R.A.B. is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Arcturus Black]] when he sees the sign on his bedroom door at Grimmauld Place. After a fruitless search of Regulus' room, Hermione recalls that there was a locket, but that they had thrown it out; Harry recalls that Kreacher was perpetually stealing stuff back, and they go to search Kreacher's sleeping area to see if he has in fact kept it. Kreacher's den is empty of valuables, but it occurs to Harry that Kreacher himself may know what happened to it. Harry summons Kreacher, who reports that he had stolen the locket back, but that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] had then stolen it from him, along with almost everything else of value in the house. Harry demands the full story; Kreacher tells how [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] had asked Regulus for a house-elf. Regulus had volunteered Kreacher, telling him that he was to come back as soon as the Dark Lord was done with his services. Kreacher had accompanied Voldemort to the island in the lake that Harry [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 26|had visited with Dumbledore]], where Voldemort had forced Kreacher to drink a potion that left him remembering horrible things. Voldemort had placed a locket in the basin, had refilled it with potion, and then had vanished, leaving Kreacher alone; Kreacher had gone to the lake for a drink of water, and had been pulled under by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]] in the lake, and then had returned to his master, Regulus, as ordered.

Later, Regulus had taken him back to that same island, and had ordered Kreacher to force him to drink the potion, and then replace the locket with the one that Harry had found in the basin, and take the locket back to Grimmauld Place and destroy it. Regulus had drained the basin with Kreacher's assistance, and then struggled to the lake for water, and had been dragged under by the Inferi; and Kreacher had returned with the locket to Grimmauld Place, but had failed his master: he had been unable to destroy the locket, no matter how hard he tried.

Harry tells him that they, too, have the mission of destroying the locket, and as a token of their shared mission, he gives Kreacher the locket that Regulus had had him place in the basin, and that Harry had later recovered. Kreacher is overjoyed at this sign of consideration from Harry. Harry asks him to find Mundungus and bring him back, and Kreacher sets off immediately.

It is some days later that Kreacher returns with Mundungus, saying that he had been hard to trace. A number of times while Harry is interrogating Mundungus, Kreacher threatens him with a frying pan, because he is evidently being disrespectful to Harry.

Over the next month or so, Kreacher's work improves significantly, to the point that Harry is starting to enjoy returning to Grimmauld Place. After the invasion of the Ministry, however, Harry, Hermione, and Ron are forced to leave Grimmauld Place. With Harry gone, Kreacher apparently decides to return to Hogwarts, possibly in the hopes that his master (Harry) will be going there.

Kreacher leads the house-elves at Hogwarts into the second part of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|battle at Hogwarts]], cutting at the legs of Death Eaters with kitchen implements. After the final battle at Hogwarts, Harry hopes to himself that his four-poster bed in the dormitories at Hogwarts is still there waiting for him, and that Kreacher would be able to bring him a sandwich there...

== Strengths ==

As a house-elf, Kreacher has significant magic ability in his own person, ability that is distinct from human magic. He also has the house-elf trait of extreme loyalty to his Masters, if he accepts them as worthy.

== Weaknesses ==

Kreacher shares the weaknesses of all House-elves: being tied to one family and one location and not being able to disobey their orders, and the relatively low verbal intelligence of the race. He is also, we are told, quite old, and when we first meet him has had no human contact except for Walburga Black's mad portrait for ten years. As such, he is presumed to be somewhat maddened himself. He does seem to recover when separated from Walburga's portrait.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

It is a unclear whether Walburga treated Kreacher well or not. It might seem so, as Kreacher seems to follow the instructions issued by Walburga's painting, while resisting those of Sirius, a live Master. However, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Dumbledore discusses how house elves become loyal and what it means. And in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Harry showed that he was on the same side as Regulus and treated Kreacher with respect, and as a result, Kreacher accepted Harry full-heartedly as his Master. 

At that point, Kreacher, to a great extent, accepted Harry's ideals as his own. We see this particularly in the Battle of Hogwarts, where Kreacher is seen leading the school's house elves to fight against Lord Voldemort, and thus against the values of his earlier Masters. From this, it appears that house elves, despite the strong link of obedience to the family and heritage, have a great loyalty of mind to those &quot;Masters&quot; who treat them well.

== Analysis ==

The author's choice of name for this character is interesting. We have seen that characters names are quite often related to their characteristics; for example, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]], a character hag-ridden by his heritage; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], whose name almost shouts his &quot;furry little problem&quot;; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]], white of beard and hair, and eccentrically bumbling about like the bumblebee which is his last name, but with equally hidden purpose. In a world where house-elves are given cutesy, childish names like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hokey|Hokey]], Kreacher, which seems to be a portmanteau of &quot;creature&quot; and &quot;treachery&quot;, is very out of place. The first time we see him, his name alone causes us to distrust him and his motives, and his perpetual string of muttered insults does nothing to change our feelings about him. One feels that the name was selected deliberately to foster that distrust; a name more in line with other house-elf names would have caused a certain cognitive dissonance that would have jarred throughout ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', as it would result in an elf with a cute name who was saying really horrible things about Harry, Hermione, and Ron. That dissonance would likely have distracted readers from the story.

Kreacher's character is written to be quite childish, in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', and child-like in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. This seems to be consistent with all we know of house elves and their intellectual development. There is more on house-elf intellect in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|that topic]].

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
#Why did Kreacher lie to Harry about Sirius?
#What causes Kreacher's change of heart towards Harry and his friends?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The author apparently insisted that Kreacher be part of the film of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] because he would play an important part in the final chapter. As we can see in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], this is the case.

At least one source had suggested that Kreacher's role would have something to do with the mysterious RAB identified with the locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]]. Having assumed that RAB was, in fact, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]], sources reasoned that it could be Kreacher who accompanied Regulus to the island of the locket; and Kreacher who was required to drink the potion that covered the locket. It is a bit of a surprise to find that it was Regulus who drank the potion, because given that Regulus was a good and loyal Black son, one would expect him to share the Black family disrespect for their servants. 

One finds it hard to imagine that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] would not have protected his Horcrux against other magical creatures; however, we have already seen with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] that house-elf magic is very hard to counter even for very powerful wizards. Additionally, Voldemort has been shown to have no respect for magic he cannot do himself; this tendency to discount non-human magic, and to discount the strength of non-Pureblood wizards, is a large part of what eventually brought him down.

== Overview ==

'''''Moaning Myrtle''''' was a former Ravenclaw student (now a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghost]]) who haunts the girl's bathroom on the first  floor (called the second floor in the US editions of the book) of Hogwarts.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

We meet Myrtle at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]]'s Deathday party. She seems a bit depressed, as many ghosts do; but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] takes the opportunity to mock her to the point that she runs off, crying. Apparently as she returns to her bathroom, she turns on all the taps.

Later, passing the spot where Mrs. Norris, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Filch]]'s cat, was Petrified, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] realize that they are passing Myrtle's bathroom. They stop in to talk to her, but she is not terribly communicative. They are caught exiting from the bathroom by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], who threatens them with a House points penalty.

Because Myrtle's bathroom is such an unwelcoming place, Hermione suggests it would be perfect for their use as they brew up a batch of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]]. They do this starting at about the middle of November. Myrtle doesn't seem to mind this activity much, usually hiding underwater somewhere and gurgling at them. When the time comes for them to use the potion, Hermione finds that she has made a mistake and used a cat hair; Myrtle seems very amused that Hermione has turned partway into a cat and is now stuck there. She finds Hermione's tail especially amusing.

Later, Harry and Ron find Myrtle's bathroom flooded; apparently she has become upset because someone threw a book at her while she was resting in the U-bend. In her anger she has turned on all the water in the bathroom. Harry recovers the book, it turns out to be a diary, originally owned by one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|T. M. Riddle]] fifty years ago.

A clue in that diary leads Harry and Ron to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who in turn sends them to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]]. Aragog, in turn, mentions that the last time the Chamber was opened, a girl died in a bathroom. It suddenly occurs to Harry that this might be Moaning Myrtle.

On their way to visit Myrtle for confirmation, Harry and Ron are caught in the halls by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]]. Thinking up a reason for their being in the halls, Harry hits upon the idea of saying that they are trying to visit Hermione in the Hospital wing, as she has been Petrified. While visiting Hermione, they find a scrap of paper that she has torn out of a book which describes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisks]]; this tells them what the monster is.

Finally, with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]] in tow, they return to Myrtle's bathroom. Myrtle confirms that it was she who had died the last time the Chamber was opened, and what she remembers matches the effects of a Basilisk; Harry figures out how to open the Chamber, and with Ron and Lockhart, he descends. When he returns, Myrtle suggests that if he had died down there, he would have been welcome to share her bathroom; Ron teases that Harry's got a girlfriend.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Harry is given a hint to the Golden Egg clue by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], and as a result ends up taking the egg to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects']] washroom. Moaning Myrtle joins him there, appearing out of one of the faucets, to his dismay – Harry tries to hide his nakedness under the bubbles; Myrtle after all is a girl. Myrtle guides Harry towards what Cedric did to his Golden Egg: opening it underwater and listening to it there. While Harry is thinking about the meaning of this clue, Myrtle is telling how she became a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost|ghost]]; Harry largely ignores her. When Harry muses how he is going to breathe underwater, Myrtle becomes affronted at being reminded that she doesn't breathe any more.

During the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Second Task|Second Task]], Harry, swimming deep in the lake, is again accosted by Moaning Myrtle. Harry is surprised that she is able to get to the lake; she says that sometimes she is sent to the lake by surprise when someone flushes her toilet unexpectedly. She points Harry in the direction of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople's]] settlement under the lake.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

At one point, Harry and Ron step into a bathroom to allow Ron to escape the clutches of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]]. Myrtle appears and is disappointed, saying that Harry had promised to visit her and never did, and that she was hoping that it was the other, sad boy who was coming in. She says that he is worried because he has a task and he has been working at it for a long time, and is not succeeding. Ron manages to insult her by mentioning that she is dead, and she leaves through the plumbing, crying.

Harry, looking at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Marauder's Map|Marauder's Map]], sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] in a nearby bathroom with Myrtle. Looking in at them, he sees that Draco is crying. Draco catches sight of him in the mirror, and immediately starts flinging curses at him. Harry retaliates. Draco starts to invoke the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crucio|Cruciatus]] curse, but Harry stops him with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Sectumsempra|Sectumsempra]] curse, one which he has read but never tried to use. This curse makes Harry's wand act like a very long knife, making great cuts appear in Draco's face and torso. Myrtle starts screaming; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] appears and manages to heal Draco.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

Myrtle is offended very easily, at least initially. Any reminder that she is dead will send her off in gouts of tears. When Tom Riddle's diary was thrown into the commode where she happened to be invisibly resting, and it happened to fall through her, this enraged her to the point that she caused all the toilets and taps to effectively erupt, sending water all through her bathroom and out into the hall. It is in part this hypersensitivity that has left her with the name Moaning Myrtle, because in fact that does seem to be what she does most of the time.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

When Harry returns from the Chamber of Secrets, she suggests that if he had died down there, Harry would have been welcome to share her bathroom. Additionally, she helps him a couple of times before and during the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament. This would seem to indicate that she has a little bit of a crush on Harry. However, when Ron and Harry use a bathroom to hide from Lavender Brown in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', Myrtle seems disappointed to see them, which would indicate that any romantic interest she has in Harry has been replaced by an interest in another boy, who turns out to be Draco Malfoy.

== Analysis ==

Most unusually for a ghost, it seems Myrtle does have some control over physical matter; apparently her haunting of the bathroom has rendered it unusable, mainly because she keeps flooding the place when she gets depressed. This is useful to the story in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] in two respects: Mrs. Norris is Petrified (in the chapter [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber_of_Secrets/Chapter_8|The Deathday Party]]), rather than being killed, because she sees the reflection of the Basilisk rather than seeing the Basilisk directly. The image is reflected in the water that Myrtle has caused to flood out of the bathroom because she was so upset at the insults lobbed at her by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peeves|Peeves]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nearly Headless Nick|Nearly Headless Nick]]'s Deathday party. Additionally, it is Myrtle's unwelcoming presence in the washroom that allows Hermione the time and space to make [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice_Potion|Polyjuice Potion]]; nobody willingly goes in there more than once, after being subjected to Myrtle's aggressive depression.

Myrtle's affinity for water also allows her to help Harry with the Second Task in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]; as the second task involves the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Merpeople|Merpeople]] under the lake, Myrtle is instrumental in allowing Harry to solve the riddle surrounding the task, and also points him in the right direction when he is looking for the Merpeople during the task proper. Myrtle says that she sometimes ends up in the lake when someone flushes a toilet in her bathroom and she's not expecting it, which may lead us to wonder about Wizarding sanitation practices.

As mentioned, Myrtle is always sad and is apparently still hypersensitive about death. It is true that she had died only fifty years before our story opens, and so could have expected, in the normal run of affairs, to still be alive; it is possible that a ghost will be especially sensitive to thoughts of death until they reach an age at which they would have died normally. As far as her perpetual sadness goes, we must remember that at the time she died, she had been driven to tears by the cruelty of another girl and was hiding in the washroom. From what Nearly Headless Nick tells us in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 38|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] regarding ghostly existence, it is entirely possible that Myrtle is sad as a ghost purely because she was so sad when she died.

== Overview == 

'''Lily Potter''' (née Evans) is a Muggle-born witch and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s mother. She was born 30 January 1960 and died on 31 October 1981 at age 21. She was quite young, 19 years old, when she became pregnant with Harry, giving birth to him at 20.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

At the start of the book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Albus Dumbledore]] confirms to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Minerva McGonagall]] that both Harry's parents have been killed.

Harry has been told that his parents had been killed in a car crash, which is why he was living with his aunt and uncle.

In the hut on the rock, when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] arrives, there is a fair amount of discussion about Lily. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Petunia Dursley]], her sister, bitterly recounts how proud everyone else was that they had a witch in the family, and of the way she would come home with pockets full of frog spawn and do magic in the house, but she (Petunia) saw Lily for what she was: a freak. Hagrid is shocked that anyone could have believed that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|James]] and Lily could have died in a car crash, tells Harry that they were murdered by the evil wizard [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], and mentions that James and Lily were head boy and head girl.

Lily's image appears in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mirror of Erised|Mirror of Erised]] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] finds it the first time at Christmas.

A large number of pictures of Lily and James are in the photo album given to Harry by Hagrid just before Harry leaves the school for the summer.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Harry, in talking with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]], mentions that when they approach him, he can hear Voldemort murdering his mother. Lupin is apparently moved by this revelation. This causes some conflict in Harry; he misses his mother greatly, and would do almost anything to hear her voice and see her face, as we have already seen. But if the only way that can happen is for him to suffer attacks from Dementors? And is he going to be able to fight Dementors, if something he wants so dearly would be removed by that fight?

Lupin later comments that Harry looks extraordinarily like his father, except for his eyes. He has his mother's eyes.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|the Shrieking Shack]], we hear [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]'s side of what happened when he was confronted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]]. Pettigrew had yelled that Sirius had betrayed James and Lily, then blew up the street, changed into his rat shape, and escaped, leaving behind his own cut-off finger and robes. Sirius had then been taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], where he had served time for the murder of Pettigrew. It turns out that it was Pettigrew who had betrayed James and Lily to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

In the battle in the graveyard, while Harry is battling Lord Voldemort, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|shadows]] of the people Voldemort has killed begin appearing. Harry's father and mother both appear and speak with him.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]], during the party that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] throws to celebrate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] being made [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefect]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Moody]] shows Harry an old picture of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]. Harry's father and mother are present in the picture. While Moody clearly intends this as something of a treat, Harry feels that he has been rather taken by surprise, and is evidently dismayed at having this picture presented to him.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]], Harry sees [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape's]] memory of an episode where his father and the other Marauders are bullying a teenage Snape. Harry also sees his then-teenage mother, who yells at Harry's father to leave Snape alone. She even goes to the length of aiming her own wand at James.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When Harry first meets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], Slughorn appears to be biased towards pure-bloods, which is no surprise given that he was head of Slytherin house. However, that doesn't mean that he refuses to see qualities in the Muggle-born; Harry's own mother, for instance, was quite a powerful witch, though of Muggle parentage, and was one of Slughorn's favorites.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] class, Professor Slughorn mentions that Lily had been truly excellent at potions, and attributes Harry's skill to his being Lily's son.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

While [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|viewing Snape's memories]] in the Pensieve, Harry sees Lily as a child at her original Muggle home. Severus Snape, also then a child, informs Lily that she is a witch and that he had been spying on her and seeing her do incredible things. Snape explains the magical world to Lily and they soon develop the bond of friendship, despite the interference of Lily's sister Petunia. Later in the memories, when Lily is at Hogwarts, she explains to Snape that they can't continue their friendship because she has issues with the type of person Snape is becoming and who he associates with. Even though Lily marries James, she is Snape's unrequited love.

As he goes to meet Voldemort in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], Harry finds that he has the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]], and uses it to summon the shades of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|his godfather Sirius Black]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Lupin]], his father James, and his mother Lily. Lily tells him that he has been so brave, and the four of them accompany Harry to the clearing where Voldemort and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] wait. Harry then drops the Stone, and the four shades vanish.

== Strengths ==

In book six, it is repeatedly mentioned that Lily has extraordinary potions skills. Professor Slughorn, as mentioned, says she was one of his brightest and most charming students.

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Lily's parents are proud to have such a talented daughter, but her sister Petunia despises Lily for her magical abilities, seeing her as a freak. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 1|the start of the first book]], we learn that Vernon and Petunia have largely cut the Potters out of their family tree.

We learn that she met James Potter in Hogwarts, and although she leaves the impression that she dislikes him because he behaves like an arrogant bully, they eventually fall in love with each other, get married, and have a son, Harry.

As a member of the Order of the Phoenix that opposes Voldemort, we are told that she, with her husband, confronts him three times, and manages to escape. However, when The Dark Lord learns from Severus Snape about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]], he starts looking for the Potter family. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Pettigrew's]] betrayal leads Voldemort to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], where he kills Lily and James.

She seems to have cherished her son, Harry, as she sacrificed her own life to protect him from Voldemort, refusing to stand aside. On those occasions when her shade was brought back, she said that she was proud of him and loved him.

== Analysis ==

Lily Evans Potter is seen as kind and caring person who stands up to bullies, including Lord Voldemort. Her friendship with Severus Snape was a close one, though Lily never loved Severus; this friendship ended when Severus called her a &quot;mudblood&quot;, the most discriminatory name in the Wizarding world. Even though Lily ended the friendship at that point, Severus still promised Albus Dumbledore &quot;anything&quot; in return for protecting her when Voldemort targeted her small son.

Knowing about the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|restrictions on magic done by students out of school]], readers may be surprised by Petunia's assertion in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] that Lily was always bringing home frog spawn and doing magic at home. We must bear Petunia's anti-magic bias in mind here, of course. If Lily was born in January, she will have turned 17 and thus come of age in January of her sixth year at Hogwarts. She will have then been able to legally perform magic at home starting with the Easter Break that year, and all later vacations, including the summer between her sixth and seventh years. To our less biased eyes, one summer and three school breaks does not constitute &quot;always&quot;, but one must remember that Petunia, already smarting from being shut out of the Wizarding world, as we discover [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|in the final book]], and seeing this as one more thing that she can't ever do, would have dwelled on these few periods obsessively, and they probably now appear in her memory to occupy far more time than they ever actually spanned.

Our only view of Lily's school days, seen as it is through the eyes of Snape, ends in her fifth year when she broke off her friendship with him. At that time, Lily hated James Potter because of his arrogance. We must assume that between then and her seventh year, James grew up, as she apparently fell in love with the man James became. They married shortly after they graduated Hogwarts, and they joined the Order of the Phoenix to fight Lord Voldemort and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]]. When her son was born, she cared and loved him more than anything in the world, even to the point where she sacrificed her own life to save him. 

Throughout Harry's life, he lacked the connection between mother and child which is so psychologically necessary to a child. It is possibly because of this lack that he reacts strongly to being surprised by the image of his parents presented by Alastor Moody in Grimmauld Place, during Harry's fifth year. Harry's loss has made his interactions with memories of his mother and father a very private business, and presentation of the picture in such public surroundings leaves him feeling that he must conceal his feelings on having these memories reactivated.

It is, perhaps, surprising that Harry turned out so well despite being reared by Lily's abusive sister. A number of times in the series, we hear that Harry inherited his mother's eyes, and it seems her personality, and good heart and soul. It may have been this gentle strength in himself that sustained him through the difficult times in the Dursley family home. Harry, perhaps, does not recognize this in himself.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

We never discover the shape of Lily's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], but we see that Snape's is a doe. As Dumbledore recognizes immediately that this means Snape's unrequited love for Lily has remained in force, we must assume that there is some relationship there. It is unknown whether Lily's Patronus would also be a doe, or whether Snape simply sees her in that light due to her being &quot;mated&quot; to James, whose Patronus is a stag. While the author has since stated that Lily's Patronus is, in fact, a doe, we should point out that the author, in interviews, often tailors her responses to the audience, and so we must lend less weight to this response than to the published work, in which the shape of Lily's Patronus is not mentioned.

When Harry brought Lily's shade back with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Resurrection Stone]], she seemed to look at him hungrily and as if she was not able to look at him enough. She also told her son that she was proud of him, and that she will love him forever and be with him until the end of his life.

== Overview ==

'''''Crookshanks''''' is a cat owned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione Granger]]. He is quite large, for a cat, orange (&quot;ginger&quot;) colored with brown stripes, and has an ugly, almost flat face and a bottle-brush tail. Although his significance to the the Harry Potter series is limited, readers have picked up traces of skepticism over his bearing. He is actually half-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Kneazle|Kneazle]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Crookshanks enters the story by jumping from the top of stacked cages in the Magical Menagerie in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], on to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s head, in an almost-successful bid to catch [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]]. Hermione, who intended to purchase an owl, instead buys Crookshanks, over Ron's  protests that Scabbers will never get any rest with &quot;that cat&quot; around, and takes him to Hogwarts. During the trip to Hogwarts, and several times over the school year, Crookshanks attempts to catch Scabbers, often damaging Ron in the process. At least once, Crookshanks seems to be deliberately eating a spider in front of Ron, which Ron sees as direct aggravation. Eventually, we are led to believe that Crookshanks fatally attacks Scabbers in the boy's dormitory.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] later sees Crookshanks in company with the large black dog that has evidently been following Harry around. This reassures Harry, who had believed the dog was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Grim|Grim]]; if Crookshanks can see him, the dog must be real rather than spectral.

As Ron, Harry, and Hermione are headed back to the castle after leaving [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] hut, Crookshanks again attacks Scabbers, who was found alive. When Ron and Scabbers are dragged into a tunnel under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] by the mysterious black dog, Crookshanks shows how to still the Willow so Harry and Hermione can follow. 

In the Shrieking Shack, it is revealed that Crookshanks befriended [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], an Animagus wizard who can communicate with Crookshanks while in his dog form. It was Crookshanks who stole the password list from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]], allowing Sirius access into the Gryffindor Common Room the night Ron was supposedly attacked, though Scabbers was the actual target. Several times during the ensuing scuffle in the Shack, Crookshanks defends Sirius against Harry: attacking Harry when he tries to recover his wand, and sitting on Sirius' chest exactly where Harry needs to fire a killing spell at Sirius.

As they exit the shack and Lupin turns into a werewolf, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] seizes Ron's wand and uses it to stun Ron and Crookshanks before making his escape.

Finally, when Sirius gives Ron a new owl, Ron holds it under Crookshanks' nose for approval before accepting it. Ginny names the owl [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pigwidgeon|Pigwidgeon]].

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

Crookshanks is at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]] with Hermione. We see him chasing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gnome|gnomes]] in the garden before dinner. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred Weasley|Fred Weasley]] drops some fireworks as the family prepares to depart for London and the Hogwarts Express, Crookshanks is frightened and mauls a Muggle taxi-driver. He rides in the same taxi as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and all three get rather badly scratched.

On the Express, and throughout the book, Crookshanks is an occasional presence, curled up on a chair, jumping into either Harry's or Hermione's lap, and generally behaving as a cat should. Crookshanks seems to be quite willing to soak up almost any amount of affection from either Harry or Hermione, and sometimes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], but does not seem to entirely trust Ron.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

At [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Number 12, Grimmauld Place]], we see Crookshanks in the kitchen, playing with Butterbeer corks, and generally acting like a cat. Throughout the book, Crookshanks is an occasional presence, curled up on a chair, jumping into either Harry's or Hermione's lap, and generally behaving as a cat should.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

It is mentioned that Crookshanks accompanies Hermione to the Hogwarts Express when they leave The Burrow. Once again, Crookshanks seems to be acting like a cat, and having only a passing role in the story.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

We see Crookshanks at Hermione's feet when she, Ron, and Harry manage to sneak some time together in amidst the wedding preparations at The Burrow. Crookshanks, here, is behaving very much like a cat, simply lying, curled up, at Hermione's feet while she sorts books. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] bursts in on them, Crookshanks, bristling, dashes under the bed to hide.

When Harry, Ron, and Hermione need to enter the tunnel at the base of the Whomping Willow, Ron wishes that they had Crookshanks with them to push the knot that will still the tree. In words strongly reminiscent of something Ron had said in the first book, Hermione says, &quot;''Are you a wizard, or what?''&quot; Ron, recollecting himself, uses the first charm he ever learned ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wingardium Leviosa|Wingardium Leviosa]]) to push a stick against the knot that stills the Willow.

== Strengths ==

Events in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' show that Crookshanks is far more intelligent than the average cat. We don't initially notice this, as all wizard's companion animals, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Trevor|Trevor]], Scabbers, and (later) Pigwidgeon, seem much more intelligent than their Muggle equivalents. While Scabbers' intelligence is explained when his true nature is revealed, Crookshanks' intelligence can only be inferred to be the product of his being a cross-breed with a Kneazle.

Being half-cat, Crookshanks is always armed, and is clearly not afraid to use his claws and teeth when he feels the need.

== Weaknesses ==

Crookshanks' ability to communicate, naturally, is limited by his being a cat.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Crookshanks is Hermione's cat; they are quite fond of each other. When Hermione first bought Crookshanks, the witch at the Magical Menagerie told her that he had been there for quite a while; the implication being that very few other witches or wizards were interested in him, or perhaps he in them. The author, describing the genesis of the character, says that he is based on a Muggle cat who would prowl around the sunbathers in a particular square, looking disdainful and refusing to be stroked. While she says that she only borrowed his appearance for Crookshanks, perhaps that character trait also crept in, at least in the beginning.

Crookshanks is perpetually trying to attack [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Scabbers|Scabbers]], who is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s pet rat. Initially he seems to be doing this because he simply doesn't trust Scabbers (he may be able to detect that Scabbers is not what he seems to be). Later, it seems he is trying to fetch Scabbers at the bidding of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], who has recognized Scabbers as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] and wants to get him away from the protection afforded him by Hogwarts. Ron, of course, is trying to defend Scabbers from Crookshanks, and gets into the middle of the battles quite often; as such, at least in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], the two of them are quite often fighting each other, and this almost rabid dislike has left enough bad memories that, while Ron can respect Crookshanks and his abilities, they are never quite comfortable with each other.

With other people, Crookshanks is more neutral, accepting affection and being willing to play. He is quite classically cat-like both with Harry and with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], climbing into laps for a quick nap and playing with Butterbeer corks.

== Analysis ==

Crookshanks' apparent extreme intelligence, as displayed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], coupled with his flattened face, has led more than one reader to believe that he might be an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagus]], possibly even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus Black]]. There is precedent in the series for an unregistered Animagus, believed dead, to have stayed in his animal guise for several years. However, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=7 the author has denied this]; in fact, she has stated, [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=10 while discussing his origins], that Crookshanks is half [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Kneazle|Kneazle]].

Although this is in murky waters with the GMail terms of use, it is possible to use GMail as a filesystem (the filesystem sends mail containing the file in question to GMail to store), and ''GMailFs'' is one such implementation of this.
Also there is an extension for Firefox called &quot;GSpace&quot; that does the same thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Step I'''&lt;br /&gt;
First, create a square image, and fill it with the colour of the balloon. Next, use the text tool to add any writing. This should be centred, and take up no more than about one-third of the space in each dimension. Merge the text layer with the colour layer.

[[Image:Gimp-balloon1.png|200px|Text on flat colour]]

'''Step II'''&lt;br /&gt;
Use &quot;Map to Object&quot; (''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Filters &gt; Map &gt; Map Object'') to create a sphere. Ensure a transparent background is selected. By default, the sphere won't take up the whole of the image, so tweak this with the Orientation controls.

[[Image:Gimp-balloon2.png|200px|Map to Object]]

'''Step III'''&lt;br /&gt;
To get the shape of a balloon, use Curve Bend (''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Filters &gt; Distorts &gt; Curve Bend'').  Select to work on the lower curve, as a smooth. Add one control point in the lower half of the grid, centred horizontally.

[[Image:Gimp-balloon3.png|200px|Curve Bend]]

'''Step IV'''&lt;br /&gt;
The resulting image won't fit the current size, so select ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Image&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Image &gt; Fit Canvas to Layers''.

__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
This book will cover the design and implementation of programmable logic devices (PLDs) using the Verilog, VHDL, and System C Hardware description languages. It is not meant to be a comprehensive reference to these languages, but more of a quick guide that covers the parts essential to developing effective digital designs. This book will also cover programming a variety of specific programmable devices, such as FPGA and CPLD devices. Contents intended to be covered are: Programming HDL, Concurrent programming and synthesis. A Previous knowledge of programming a high-level language is assumed. Knowledge of [[Semiconductors]] is helpful but not necessary. Previous experience or knowledge of [[Digital Circuits]] is must.

This is a book about A-Level Computing. It aims to fit with the [http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/subjects/specifications/alevel/AQA-2510-W-SP-14.PDF AQA GCE A-Level Computing] syllabus but is not endorsed by AQA. It should be useful as a revision guide or to find alternative explanations to the ones in your textbook. If you haven't heard of an A-Level then this book probably won't be of much interest to you but you can find out about them at [[w:A-Level|Wikipedia]].

If any part of this book ''is'' unclear or even wrong then please post a comment on the discussion page or simply fix it yourself! In particular, please say if the book assumes any knowledge or skills which not all A-Level Computing students have.

== What good is the multiplication property? ==

Doesn't that imply''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;M_1\cdot \cos(\omega t + \phi_1) \cdot M_2\cdot \cos(\omega t + \phi_2) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{?}}{=}\ M_1\cdot M_2\cdot \cos(\omega t + \phi_1+\phi_2) \,&lt;/math&gt;

which is not true.

== RMS vs Peak ==

I stumbled over this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M \angle \phi = M \cos (t\omega + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

As far as I understand this (I just started going through a power engineering text book), the right-hand side must be multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt; for the formula to be correct:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C} = M \angle \phi = \sqrt 2 M \cos (t\omega + \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

This is because the right-hand side shows the instantaneous equation, where M is the maximal value, and on the left-hand side M is the rms (root mean square) value, which is obtained by
dividing the maximal value by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;. Could anyone comment on this?

Would suggest adding the phasor definitions in Complex number and complex polar system.</text>

{{cleanup|page needs general work}}

'''FASM''', also known as &quot;[http://flatassembler.net/]flat assembler&quot;, is an optimizing assembler for the x86 architecture.
FASM is written in assembly, so it can assemble/bootstrap itself. It runs on various operating systems including DOS, Windows, Linux, and Unix.
It supports the x86 and x86-64 instruction sets including SIMD extensions MMX, SSE - SSE4, and AVX.

==Hexadecimal Numbers==

FASM supports all popular syntaxes used to define hexadecimal numbers:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
0xbadf00d ; C-Like Syntax
$badf00d  ; Pascal-Like Syntax
0badf00dh  ; h Syntax, requires leading zero to be valid at assembly time
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Labels==
FASM supports several unique labeling features.

===Anonymous Labels===
FASM supports labels that use no identifier or label name.

* @@: represents an anonymous label. Any number of anonymous labels can be defined.
* @b refers to the closest @@ that can be found when looking backwards in source. @r and @b are equivalent.
* @f refers to the closest @@ that can be found when looking forwards in source.
 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
@@:
    inc eax
    push eax
    jmp @b     ; This will result in a stack fault sooner or later
    jmp @f     ; This instruction will never be hit
@@:            ; if jmp @f was ever hit, the instruction pointer would be set to this anonymous label
    invoke ExitProcess, 0 ; Winasm only
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Local Labels===
Local labels, which begin with a '''.''' (period).
You can reference a local label in the context of its global label parent.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
entry globallabel

globallabel:
    .locallabelone:
        jmp globallabel2.locallabelone
    .locallabeltwo:
 
globallabel2:
    .locallabelone:
    .locallabeltwo:
        jmp globallabel.locallabelone ; infinite loop

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Operators==
FASM supports several unique operators to simplify assembly code.

===The $ Operator===
'''$''' describes the current location in an addressing space. It is used to determine the size of a block of code or data. 
The MASM equivalent of the '''$''' is equivalent is the '''SIZEOF''' operator.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
mystring db &quot;This is my string&quot;, 0
mystring.length = $ - mystring
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===The # Operator===
'''#''' is the symbol concatenation operator, used for combining multiple symbols into one. It can only be used inside of the body of a macro like '''rept''' or a custom/user-defined macro, 
because it will replace the name of the macro argument supplied with its value.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
macro contrived value {
    some#value db 22
}
; ...
contrived 2

; assembles to...
some2 db 22
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===The ` Operator===
''' ` ''' is used to obtain the name of a symbol passed to a macro, converting it to a string.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
macro print_contrived value {
    formatter db &quot;%s\n&quot;
    invoke printf, formatter, `value
}
; ...
print_contrived SOMEVALUE

; assembles to...
formatter db &quot;%s\n&quot;
invoke printf, formatter, &quot;SOMEVALUE&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Built In Macros==
FASM has several useful built in macros to simplify writing assembly code.

===Repetition===
The '''rept''' directive is used to compact repetitive assembly instructions into a block. The directive begins with the word '''rept''', then a number or variable specifying the number of times the assembly instructions inside of the curly braces proceeding the instruction should be repeated. The counter variable can be aliased to be used as a symbol, or as part of an instruction within the '''rept''' block.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
rept 2 {
    db &quot;Hello World!&quot;, 0Ah, 0
}

; assembles to...
db &quot;Hello World!&quot;, 0Ah, 0
db &quot;Hello World!&quot;, 0Ah, 0

; and...
rept 2 helloNumber {
    hello#helloNumber db &quot;Hello World!&quot;, 0Ah, 0 ; use the symbol concatenation operator '#' to create unique labels hello1 and hello2
}

; assembles to...
hello1 db &quot;Hello World!&quot;, 0Ah, 0
hello2 db &quot;Hello World!&quot;, 0Ah, 0

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Structures===
The '''struc''' directive allows assembly of data into a format similar to that of a C structure with members.
The definition of a '''struc''' makes use of local labels to define member values.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
struc 3dpoint x, y, z
{
    .x db x,
    .y db y,
    .z db z
}

some 3dpoint 1, 2, 3

; assembles to...
some:
    .x db 1
    .y db 2
    .z db 3

; access a member through some.x, some.y, or some.z for x, y, and z respectively

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Custom Macros==
FASM supports defining custom macros as a way of assembling multiple instructions or conditional assembly as one larger instruction.
They require a name and can have an optional list of arguments, separated by commas.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
macro name arg1, arg2, ... {
   ; &lt;macro body&gt;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Variable Arguments===
Macros can support a variable number of arguments through the square bracket syntax.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
macro name arg1, arg2, [varargs] {
   ; &lt;macro body&gt;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Required Operands===
The FASM macro syntax can require operands in a macro definition using the '''*''' operator after each operand.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
; all operands required, will not assemble without
macro mov op1*, op2*, op3*
{
    mov op1, op2
    mov op2, op3
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Operator Overloading===
The FASM macro syntax allows for the overloading of the syntax of an instruction, or creating a new instruction. 
Below, the '''mov''' instruction has been overloaded to support a third operand. In the case that none is supplied, the regular move
instruction is assembled. Otherwise, the data in '''op2''' is moved to '''op1''' and '''op2''' is replaced by '''op3'''.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
; not all operands required, though if op1 or op2 are not supplied
; assembly should fail
; could also be defined as 'macro mov op1*, op2*, op3' to force requirement of the first two arguments
macro mov op1, op2, op3
{
    if op3 eq
        mov op1, op2
    else
        mov op1, op2
        mov op2, op3
    end if
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Hello World==
This is a complete example of a Win32 assembly program that prints 'Hello World!' to the console and then waits for the user to press any key before exiting the application.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
format PE console                            ; Win32 portable executable console format
entry _start                                 ; _start is the program's entry point

include 'win32a.inc'                         

section '.data' data readable writable       ; data definitions

hello db &quot;Hello World!&quot;, 0
stringformat db &quot;%s&quot;, 0ah, 0

section '.code' code readable executable     ; code

_start:
        invoke printf, stringformat, hello   ; call printf, defined in msvcrt.dll
        invoke getchar                       ; wait for any key
        invoke ExitProcess, 0                ; exit the process

section '.imports' import data readable      ; data imports

library kernel, 'kernel32.dll',\             ; link to kernel32.dll, msvcrt.dll
        msvcrt, 'msvcrt.dll'

import kernel, \                             ; import ExitProcess from kernel32.dll
       ExitProcess, 'ExitProcess'

import msvcrt, \                             ; import printf and getchar from msvcrt.dll
       printf, 'printf',\
       getchar, '_fgetchar'
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 6. Ecology of Invasive Species&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----

Everyone may not accept what a particular ecologist or group of ecologists deem as &quot;the way things work&quot;.  Ecology is a relatively young and complex science.  As a result, some ecological concepts are based largely on conceptualizing rather than experimentation. It is not easy to test many ecological hypotheses, because it is nearly impossible to control all variables in nature and to replicate nature in controlled settings. The subject or science of &quot;invasive species&quot; involves the basics of ecological thought and has considerable import to global species diversity. However, this is a  subject entangled with controversy.[[File: Kudzu on trees in Atlanta, Georgia.jpg|thumb|right|Kudzu, a Japanese vine species invasive in the southeast United States, growing in Atlanta, Georgia]] According to Shea Katriona et al. (2002){{ref|Katriona 2002}}, the Earth’s ecosystems are being majorly impacted by biological invasions. She suggests that the invasions can be studied by multiple viewpoints including,'''(1)''' the characteristics of the invaders,'''(2)''' the characteristics of the invaded communities,'''(3)''' resources available, and '''(4)''' natural enemies. Katriona used the community ecology theory by linking these viewpoints and by applying recent niche concepts with the communities in which they invade, which provides a predictive framework for invasion ecology. The framework presented here, however, shows how core issues of invasion ecology can be introduced into communities and lead to better understanding of the effects of invasion on earth's ecosystems.

==Species status and terminology==
[[Image:Mosquitofish.jpg|thumb|right|The mosquito fish can have both detrimental and beneficial effects.]]
Even for biologists, establishing the '''''distributional status''''' of a species in a particular location is not always straight-forward.  Questions often arise as to what exactly makes a species native as opposed to non-native, because some non-native species have no known negative impacts (Woods and Moriarty, 2001){{note|woods}}. In fact, sometimes the same species can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. For example, the mosquito fish (''Gambusia affinis'')has been widely introduced around the world because of its suppression of larval mosquitoes, but also has negative impacts on native species of insects, fishes, and amphibians (Colautti and MacIsaac, 2004){{note|colautti}}.  Also, natural biological invasions, generally considered range expansions, and introductions involving human activities are important and could be considered a normal ecological process (Vermeij, 2005){{note|vermeij}}. 

Non-native and native species may be sometimes considered invasive, with invasions often following human-induced landscape changes. The subsequent &quot;damage&quot; to existing ecosystems is simply a value judgment(Foster and Sandberg 2004){{note|foster}}. For example, various status classifications exist based solely on the location or the discipline that a biologist is working in (Helmreich, 2005). As a result, many important terms relevant to invasion biology, such as &quot;invasive&quot;, &quot;weed&quot;, or &quot;transient&quot;, include qualities that are &quot;open to subjective interpretation&quot; (Colautti and MacIsaac, 2004){{note|colautti}}. Accordingly, attempts to redefine commonly used terms in invasion ecology have been difficult because many authors and biologists are partial to a favorite definition (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004){{note|colautti}}.  Also, the status and identification of any species as an invader, a weed, or an exotic are &quot;conditioned by cultural and political circumstances&quot; (Robbins 2005){{note|robbins}}

The large number and current complexity of terms used in invasion ecology makes interpretation of the literature challenging and often intimidating. &quot;Exotic&quot;, &quot;alien&quot;, &quot;transplanted&quot;, &quot;introduced&quot;, &quot;nonindigenous&quot;, and &quot;invasive&quot; are all words that have been used to describe plants and animals that have been moved beyond their native ranges by humans (Williams and Meffe 2005){{note|williams}}. &quot;Foreign&quot;, &quot;injurious&quot;, &quot;aquatic nuisance&quot;, &quot;pest&quot;, and &quot;non-native&quot;, are also used as descriptive terms, each with a particular implication.  Even the use of what seem to be simple, basic terms to articulate ecological concepts &quot;can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts&quot; (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004){{note|colautti}}.

Table 9-1 illustrates the relationships among the most common terms describing species status. Setting aside the obvious difficulty that it is not always certain whether a species is truly native or not native to a particular location (requiring evidence of its presence prior to arrival of humans at that location), the greatest area of controversy involves the division of introduced species into '''invasive''' and '''non-invasive''' (&quot;all others&quot; in Table 9-1)because &quot;harm&quot; can be a subjective term based on individual judgement.  Although there is a tendency to view &quot;harm&quot; or &quot;pest&quot; largely in economic terms, here we need to focus on the concept in an ecological sense.

==Prevalence of Invasive Species==
[[Image:MG 7005.jpg|thumb|left|''Acacia baileyana'' or Cootamundra Wattle is an invasive species on the island of Australia]]
Invasive species are considered a &quot;significant component of global change&quot; as they cause both ecological and genetic changes in the communities that they invade (Sakai et al. 2001){{note|sakai}}. In fact, the number of species that are transferred from one biogeographical area to another each day is thought to be very large. Also, while the geographic trends and prevalence of these invasive species are not easily predicted, islands tend to contain the largest proportion. On average, though, most countries accommodate about 20% of invasive species in their vegetation. On a global scale, it is estimated that invasive species have come to occupy about 3% of the Earth's total ice-free surface over the last 500 years (Mooney and Cleland 2001){{note|mooney}}.

== Invasive Theories ==

The concept and implications of invasive species and invasion are explained by several ideas, including: '''(1)The Biotic Resistance Hypothesis''' and '''(2) The Invasive Meltdown Theory.''' 

===Biotic Resistance Hypothesis===

The '''Biotic Resistance Hypothesis''' states that species-rich communities are more resistant to invasion because these types of communities are able to use the resources/nutrients more effectively/efficiently than communities with low species-richness.[[Image:A cotton-tailed rabbit surrounded by invasive garlic mustard, mugwort, and burdock.jpg|thumb|right|The native cottontail rabbit among non-native plants like the garlic mustard, mugwort, and burdock]]

Species diversity, a term related to species richness, is also important to the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis.  Species diversity has two components- (1) '''Species richness''' represented by ''s''- which is the number of species in a '''community''' which is an assemblage of populations, and (2) '''Species eveness''' represented by ''e''- which is the number of individuals of each species in a community.

There are several factors as to why invaders succeed: '''(1)''' they are highly competitive and which may allow them to reproduce more rapidly '''(2)''' proximity to the community is a crucial factor dealing with invasion and is divided into two parts- (a) abundance of the invader and (b) distance from the community that is being invaded upon, '''(3)''' dispersal rate of invaders to new habitat (there may be new migration paths that become available), and '''(4)''' degree of disturbance.

===Invasive Meltdown Theory===
[[Image:Soo_Locks-Sault-Ste_Marie.png|thumb|right|Aerial picture of the Soo Locks between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, USA]]
The '''Invasive Meltdown Theory''' states that as species are added to an ecosystem, each one representing a potential disturbance, the native system is perturbed in such a way that the system reaches a threshold, at which point it cannot resist any further and invasions occur exponentially. Every individual invader is a threat, but it is their collective impact that can cause the greatest damage to a habitat. This phenomenon is termed '''invasional cartels''', and creates the conditions for a meltdown.  

One illustration of the meltdown hypothesis is the invasion of the great lakes by zebra mussels. The lakes, once incredibly murky, became crystal clear after 15 years of filtering action by the mussels that were brought in on cargo ships from the Black Sea. While the result was desirable, the mussels caused the natural defenses of the lake to be out of flux and the lakes a very easy target for invasion of non-native species. When the amount of species invading the lake are greater than the environment can support, a collapse or meltdown of the entire environment results.

[[Image:Male Ring-necked Pheasant at Deer Park, WA.jpg|thumb|left|A male Ring-Necked Pheasant at Deer Park, WA.]]
The counterargument to the meltdown theory involves naturalized species. A naturalized species is one that has become established without any major impact to the environment. Mitchell argues that many naturalized species get a &quot;bad name&quot; from the invasive species that cause a great deal of trouble, such as the zebra mussels mentioned above.{{ref|Mitchell2003}} A good example of a naturalized species is the Ring Necked Phesant. Intended to be a colony of game birds, it was brought to the mid-west where it flourished without disturbing the native biota. It co-exists with native game birds like partridge and grouse. 

Invasive species do not necessarily always have negative effects. For example, in North Dakota, one invasive species is being used to battle another. Leafy spurge is a weed that grows rampant throughout North Dakota and inhibits all other plant life where it grows. The solution to this has been to bring in another non-native species, the flea beetle which feeds on leafy spurge alone. Notably, it has no recorded negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, although it is technically an invasive species, it is being used to keep the North Dakota prairie ecosystem in tact.{{ref|Nelson1999}}[[Image:Aphthona flava flea beetle cropped.jpg|thumb|right|An Aphthona flava flea beetle is shown here feeding on leafy spurge.]]

==Effects of Invasion==
Invasive species have the capability of drastically changing ecosystems, and meanwhile can also affect the human economy.  Agriculture, forestry, recreation, and disease are just some examples of issues that can be positively or negatively influenced by invasive species.  Sometimes the [[Wikepedia.en|invasive species|invasive species]] can be beneficial, and sometimes humans face the nuisance of a troublesome invader.  

With the expanding global economy, increasing trade volume and international trade agreements influencing trade worldwide, the risks of &quot;alien&quot; invasions are increasing. The high disturbance of industrial areas increases the disturbances of natural habitats and allow for invasive specicies to establish. In the last three decades in China, the increasing biological invasions run hand in hand with the increase in economic development (Wen Lin et al. 2007){{ref|Lin2007}}. In the last three decades China has had a significantly expanded economically with global trade and has consequently been affected by invasive species. 

Economic and human factors have both inderect and direct factors which influence the transportation and redistribution of [[Wikepedia.en|invasive species|invasive species]]. The increase in global trade by land air and sea has intensified the redistribution of invasive species from places that would normally be isolated. The study of ecological factors on the influence of invasive species are vary rarely studied, and may lead to improving the understanding, predictions, and management of invasive species.     

At times, import of an [[Wikepedia.en|invasive species|invasive species]]is desired for economical benefit, but that species is potentially harmful to another ecological or economical aspect.  Much effort is being put into accurately designing risk assessment technologies to determine the net economic benefit of incorporating a nonnative species to an environment. {{ref||Keller}} Keller ''et al.'' (2007) analyzed an Australian plant quarantine program (in which plants were used to make ornaments) to develop such a risk assessment program over a wide range of variables.  They took into account long-term invasive effects over 10-500 years, and their results indicated that the benefits outweighed the costs in this case.  The equation that was developed is: E&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;=((1-''a'')&lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt;''A''+''a''&lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt;(1-''A''))V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;-''a''&lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt;(1-''A'')V&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;-''D'', where &lt;s&gt;0&lt;/s&gt; is the number of new species,V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the benefit of a single species, ''a'' is the rate of invasion, V&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; is the economic loss caused by an invasive species,''A'' is a proportional accuracy,''D''is the cost of administering the risk assessment preparation and execution, and E&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the resulting annual net benefit. This equation seems very straightforward and has accurate and even possibly underestimated results for net benefit.  However, the terms can be hard to determine, and in the case studied in this project, the annual cost of risk assessment analysis was estimated to be $300,000.  This is accounted for, however, by the term ''D'', and is thus incorporated into the equation.  [[Image:Aedes albopictus cdc.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Aedes albopictus'', also known as the Asian tiger mosquito,has invaded many countries including the U.S. in the last two decades.  It is a common carrier of diseases, including the West Nile virus.]]Such risk assessments are important to the balance of economic and ecological success for a case in which incorporation of an invasive species would be necessary.

Invasive pests can kill plants and hamper agriculture, but sometimes can affect the health of animals and even humans.  For example, the West Nile virus was never introduced to the Western Hemisphere until 1999, when mosquitos that carried the disease were somehow transferred across the Atlantic Ocean.  Mosquitos are the most prominent insect vectors of disease, and Juliano and Lounibos (2005){{ref|Juliano}} used this quality to study the dyanamics of invasive species.  The introduction, spread, and impacts of an introduced species can be fairly accurately measured in terms of spread of an associated disease.  This particular study focused on the ''Aedes albopictus'' mosquito.  This species was observed under varying conditions, and the effects of competition and predation were measured to determine whether they could slow or prevent invasion.  Studies such as this can determine what types of environments (including both biotic and abiotic factors)are susceptible to invasion.  This particular project emphasizes that full understanding of such a process must include introduction, spread, and long-term impact of the invasive species.  If a study only monitors the current conditions, important dynamics of the system may be overlooked.

== Summarization ==
Although there exists many terms describing what is usually called species '''status''' for a particular location, most terms are not especially controversial and largely reflect that different disciplines (e.g., agriculture, botany, ornithology, entomology) have developed preferred terminologies for describing essentially the same things.

===What is a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)?===

A Programmable Logic Controller, or PLC, is more or less a small computer with a built-in operating system (OS). This OS is highly specialized and optimized to handle incoming events in real time, i.e., at the time of their occurrence.

The PLC has input lines, to which ''sensors'' are connected to notify of events (such as temperature above/below a certain level, liquid level reached, etc.), and output lines, to which ''actuators'' are connected to effect or signal reactions to the incoming events (such as start an engine, open/close a valve, and so on).

The system is user programmable. It uses a language called &quot;Relay Ladder&quot; or RLL (Relay Ladder Logic). The name of this language implies that the control logic of the earlier days, which was built from relays, is being simulated.

Some other languages used include:
# Sequential Function chart
# Functional block diagram
# structured Text
# Instruction List

===PLC usage scenarios===
A PLC is primarily used to control machinery.  A program written for a PLC consists basically of instructions to turn on and off outputs based on input conditions and the internal program. In this respect, it is similar to how a standard computer application is used. Once a PLC program is activated, however, it will typically run continuously as a loop for an indefinite period. PLC-based systems are frequently used not only to control simple devices such as a garage door opener, but also for solving complex application scenarios, such as controlling a whole house, including switching lights on or off at certain times, monitoring custom built security system, and so on. 

Most commonly, a PLC is found inside of a machine in an industrial environment. A PLC can run an automatic machine for years with little human intervention. They are designed to withstand most harsh environments.

===History  of PLCs===

When the first electronic machine controls were designed, they used relays to control the machine logic (i.e. press &quot;Start&quot; to start the machine and press &quot;Stop&quot; to stop the machine).  A basic machine might need a wall covered in relays to control all of its functions.  There are a few limitations to this type of control.

* Relays fail.
* The delay when the relay turns on/off.
* There is an entire wall of relays to design/wire/troubleshoot.

A PLC overcomes these limitations, it is a machine controlled operation.

===Recent developments===

PLCs are becoming more and more intelligent. In recent years PLCs have been integrated into electrical communications such as Computer network(s) i.e., all the PLCs in an industrial environment have been plugged into a network which is usually hierarchically organized. The PLCs are then supervised by a control centre. There exist many proprietary types of networks. One type which is widely known is SCADA .

== Basic Concepts ==

===How the PLC operates===

The PLC is a purpose-built machine control computer designed to read digital and analog inputs from various sensors, execute a user defined logic program, and write the resulting digital and analog output values to various output elements like hydraulic and pneumatic actuators, indication lamps, solenoid coils, etc.
====Scan cycle====

Exact details vary between manufacturers, but most PLCs follow a 'scan-cycle' format.

; Overhead : Overhead includes testing I/O module integrity, verifying the user program logic hasn't changed, that the computer itself hasn't locked up (via a watchdog timer), and any necessary communications. Communications may include traffic over the PLC programmer port, remote I/O racks, and other external devices such as HMIs (Human Machine Interfaces).

; Input scan : A 'snapshot' of the digital and analog values present at the input cards is saved to an input memory table.

; Logic execution : The user program is scanned element by element, then rung by rung until the end of the program, and resulting values written to an output memory table.
;Diagnosis and communication :is used in many different disciplines with variations in the use of logics, analytics, and experience to determine &quot;cause and effect&quot;. In systems engineering and computer science, it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations, and solutions. it is communicate to input module and send message to output module for any incorrect data files variations.

; Output scan : Values from the resulting output memory table are written to the output modules.

Once the output scan is complete the process repeats itself until the PLC is powered down.

The time it takes to complete a scan cycle is, appropriately enough, the &quot;scan cycle time&quot;, and ranges from hundreds of milliseconds (on older PLCs, and/or PLCs with very complex programs) to only a few milliseconds on newer PLCs, and/or PLCs executing short, simple code.

== Basic instructions ==
Be aware that specific nomenclature and operational details vary widely between PLC manufacturers, and often implementation details evolve from generation to generation.

Often the hardest part, especially for an inexperienced PLC programmer, is practicing the mental ju-jitsu necessary to keep the nomenclature straight from manufacturer to manufacturer. 

; Positive Logic (most PLCs follow this convention)
: True = logic 1 = input energized.
: False = logic 0 = input NOT energized.

; Negative Logic
: True = logic 0 = input NOT energized
: False = logic 1 = input energized. 

; Normally Open
: (XIC) - eXamine If Closed.
: This instruction is true (logic 1) when the hardware input (or internal relay equivalent) is energized.

; Normally Closed
: (XIO) - eXamine If Open.
: This instruction is true (logic 1) when the hardware input (or internal relay equivalent) is NOT energized.

; Output Enable
: (OTE) - OuTput Enable. 
: This instruction mimics the action of a conventional relay coil.

; On Timer
: (TON) - Timer ON.
: Generally, ON timers begin timing when the input (enable) line goes true, and reset if the enable line goes false before setpoint has been reached. If enabled until setpoint is reached then the timer output goes true, and stays true until the input (enable) line goes false.

; Off Timer
: (TOF) - Timer OFF.
: Generally, OFF timers begin timing on a true-to-false transition, and continue timing as long as the preceding logic remains false. When the accumulated time equals setpoint the TOF output goes on, and stays on until the rung goes true.

; Retentive Timer
: (RTO) - Retentive Timer On.
: This type of timer does NOT reset the accumulated time when the input condition goes false.
Rather, it keeps the last accumulated time in memory, and (if/when the input goes true again) continues timing from that point. In the Allen-Bradley construction, this instruction goes true once setpoint (preset) time has been reached, and stays true until a RES (RESet) instruction is made true to clear it. 

; Latching Relays
: (OTL) - OuTput Latch.
: (OTU) - OuTput Unlatch.

Generally, the unlatch operator takes precedence. That is, if the unlatch instruction is true then the relay output is false even though the latch instruction may also be true. 
In Allen-Bradley ladder logic, latch and unlatch relays are separate operators. 

However, other ladder dialects opt for a single operator modeled after RS (Reset-Set) flip-flop IC chip logic.

;Jump to Subroutine
: (JSR) - Jump to SubRoutine
:For jumping from one rung to another the JSR (Jump to Subroutine) command is used.

'''Patents''' are temporary monopolies granted to inventors by the government, in exchange for public disclosure of how the invention works. They are one of the basic forms of '''intellectual property'''.  A patent is a property right.  Essentially, a patent gives the holder the right to exclude others from, among other things, using, selling, and making the claimed invention. 

This text outlines patent law as it is applied in the United States.

==Introduction==
===History of patent law===

The idea of patents dates back to Aristotle, but the earliest patent system was implemented in Venice in 1474. England issued its first patents under Elizabeth I and established a patent system in the '''Statute of Monopolies of 1624''', the country's first antitrust law as well as its first patent law (barring all monopolies except over disclosed inventions).

Colonial governments in British North America issued patents as early as 1641, but the separate patent systems in each state led to problems as the colonies became better interconnected. The best-known of these problems was a conflict over the steamship patent in the late 1700s. These issues led the Constitutional Convention to add a clause to the Constitution permitting Congress to enact a national patent regime.

The '''Patent Act of 1790''' created a very simple structure for granting patents, consisting of a three-member panel led by the Secretary of State (at that time, Thomas Jefferson). In 1836, the law was revised to provide for a system of '''patent examiners''', similar to that which is used today. Today's patent law mostly dates to the '''Patent Act of 1952'''.

In 1982, Congress created the '''Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit''' (CAFC) to hear patent appeals from across the country. One of the purposes for the Federal Circuit was to bring patent doctrine under the watch of a specialist court. Under the Federal Circuit, patents have strengthened, and more inventors have filed to take advantage of this stronger patent protection.

===Parts of a patent===

The key legal component of a patent is the '''claims''', which set the legal scope of the patent.  The claims are found at the very end of a printed U.S. patent.  These claims are supported by the rest of the patent, generally described as the specification.  The patent is also required to have an abstract, providing a summary of the ''claimed'' invention in non-legal language. 

====Claims====

The '''claims''' are the most important component of a patent. The claims are what define the scope of the patent—which devices/compositions/processes its monopoly will cover, and which devices/compositions/processes are outside the monopoly.    Infringement cases always revolve around the claims, not the specification, although the specification can be used to clarify the meaning of terms appearing in the claims.  Despite any language in the specification to the contrary, (such as “The invention is ...“ or &quot;The invention includes ...“), only the claims determine the scope of the monopoly right.   

Some claims may include one or more '''means plus function''' elements, which define that element by the desired result of the element and will encompass well-known or later-discovered substitutions that perform that function.  A &quot;means for attaching part A to part B&quot; could include various well-known types fasteners, such as nails, screws, bolts, glue, etc. and any equivalent means discovered after the filing date of the patent application.  For instance, a &quot;means for attaching part A to part B&quot; element in a patent issued before the invention of velcro may cover the claimed device using velcro as a fastener.  A claim cannot be composed entirely of &quot;means plus function&quot; elements.  

Unless defined otherwise in the specification, all terms of the claims must be construed according to their common usage in the field of the invention at the time the patent application was filed.

====Specification====

From a researcher's perspective, the '''specification''' preceding the claims is the most interesting part of a patent. It shows how the invention works and how it is made and used.

The chief legal requirements for the specification is that it must &quot;describe&quot; the claimed invention in sufficient detail to &quot;teach others how to make and use the invention&quot;.  These are referred to as the '''written description''' and '''enablement''' requirements, respectively.  The written description and enablement must match the breadth of the claims.  If a claim includes devices/compositions/processes which are not described or are not enabled by the specification, that claim is invalid.   It is not necessary for the specification to teach anything that is already well-known in the field of the invention, the written description and enablement requirements are judged assuming the reader of the patent to be a person having ordinary skill in the field.

The written description requirement is often considered to have an evidentiary purpose: it shows exactly what the inventor has discovered. In some cases, an insufficient written description can show that inventors are not due the full breadth of the claims. A famous example is Sawyer and Man's patent on the light bulb, in which the description discussed various filaments made of paper and wood, none of which were particularly superior for use in light bulbs. When Sawyer and Man tried to use their patent against Thomas Edison, his lawyers had it invalidated because its claims, covering all fibrous materials, were much broader than the materials Sawyer and Man had actually outlined in the description. ''The Incandescent Lamp Patent'', 159 U.S. 465 (1895).

Additionally, the description must disclose the '''best mode''' for carrying out the invention, as known by the inventors at the time the patent application is filed. The idea is that a person cannot gain the monopoly of a general patent while keeping secret their best embodiment of the invention. In ''Bayer AG v. Schein Pharmaceuticals'', 301 F.3d 1306 (2002), the Federal Circuit established a two-prong test for finding best mode violations:

# Did the inventor have a best mode of practicing the invention at the time they filed for the patent? If they didn't know of, or believe in, a best mode at that time, then there is no best mode violation.
# Is the disclosure in the patent specification adequate to enable a person having ordinary skill in the art to practice the best mode of the invention?

The specification may (but is not required to) include a &quot;background section&quot;, which is used to describe the state of the art before the arrival of the instant invention and often describes the challenges or problems with the prior art that the instant invention seeks to solve.

===Types of patent===

====Utility patents====

Most patents are '''utility patents''', so called because they cover &quot;useful&quot; processes and products. This text focuses on utility patents.

A utility patent can cover a physical '''product''' (e.g. a chemical compound), or it can cover a '''process''' for using a product (e.g. a method for creating a chemical compound). The scope of these concepts has changed over time. For example:

*'''Artificially-created organisms''' were not patentable as products until the Supreme Court's decision in ''Diamond v. Chakrabarty'', 447 U.S. 303 (1980), which held that a genetically-engineered bacterium was a &quot;nonnaturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter&quot; entitled to product protection.
*'''Business methods''' were not patentable until the Federal Circuit's decision in ''State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group'', 149 F.3d 1368 (1998), holding that a patentable process must accomplish &quot;a useful, concrete and tangible result&quot;.

A utility patent is in effect from the date the patent issues until twenty years from the date the application for patent was filed, so long as periodic maintenance fees are paid.

====Design patents====

'''Design patents''' are awarded to original designs for articles of manufacture. Like utility patents, design patents require novelty and nonobviousness. There is no utility requirement, but there are two other criteria for design patents. First, they must have '''ornamentality'''&amp;mdash;they must be &quot;the product of aesthetic skill and artistic conception.&quot; Design patents must also be '''not primarily functional'''. If the design is primarily functional, it should be the subject of a utility patent, not a design patent.

Design patents last for fourteen years.

====Plant patents====

'''Plant patents''' can be granted for any distinct and new variety of asexually-reproducing plant. Overall, plant patents are not as strong as utility patents in terms of protection.

Plant patents last twenty years from the date of application.

===Patent procedure===

Two terms often used to describe the procurement of a patent are '''preparation''' and '''prosecution'''.  '''Preparation''' refers to the actual drafting of the patent application, whereas '''prosecution''' refers to the negotiation process with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to obtain a patent.  Collectively, many practitioners refer to this process as '''prep. and pros.''' or simply, prosecution for short.  The duration of prosecution varies greatly. The average successful prosecution takes about three years from start to finish, but exceptional prosecution cases can be completed within one year or drag on for more than a decade. Much prosecution delay is due to backlogs in the Patent Office caused by too many applications and not enough qualified examiners.  Partly because of this backlog, in many art units an examiner's goals require averaging no more than 18 hours to perform the entire prosecution of each application.  Nevertheless, in art units like software, backlogs have been known to extend to 5 years.  Where delay is demonstrably due to patent office personel not meeting their timetables for responding to applicants, the term of the patent can be extended by the period of delay.  

====Filing====

The process starts when an '''application''' is filed with the Patent Office. The application contains the components which will form the final patent&amp;mdash;the '''specification''' (summary and description) and the '''claims''' (the &quot;new&quot; portions of the invention, which will be protected by the patent). The application must be signed under oath and accompanied by a filing fee.

If an inventor is not ready to file a full utility application, they can file a '''provisional application'''. The provisional application mainly serves to establish a priority date for the invention, a concept discussed later. After filing a provisional application, the inventor has twelve months to file their utilty application, claiming the earlier priority date of the provisional application.

An inventor can file for a patent on their own, but most inventors enlist the help of a person who has passed the '''Patent Bar Examination'''. If this person has a law degree, they are known as a '''patent attorney'''. Trained scientists and engineers can also take the examination: they have the title of '''patent agent'''. The only practical difference, besides educational background, is that patent attorneys are also qualified lawyers and (if admitted to a state bar) can take patent infringement cases to court.

====Inside the Patent Office====

The Patent Office is divided into eight '''Technology Centers''', each of which deals with a specific area of technology:

* Technology Center 1600: biotechnology and organic chemistry
* Technology Center 1700: chemical and materials engineering
* Technology Center 2100: computer architecture software and information security 
* Technology Center 2600: communications
* Technology Center 2800: semiconductors, electrical and optical systems and components
* Technology Center 2900: designs 
* Technology Center 3600: transportation, e-commerce, construction, agriculture
* Technology Center 3700: mechanical engineering, manufacturing and products
* Technology Center 3900: reexaminations

Each center is divided into several '''examining groups''', and each examining group is divided into several '''art units'''. Some groups are highly specialized to deal with fields that deal with many patent applications (Electronic Commerce). Other groups are more diverse (e.g. Aeronautics, Agriculture, Fishing, Trapping, Vermin Destroying, Plant and Animal Husbandry, Weaponry, Nuclear Systems, and Licensing and Review&amp;mdash;a single examining group).

The art units are staffed by '''patent examiners''' who perform the actual examination of the application, usually after a waiting period of about a year. The examiner reviews each claim separately.

If the examiner considers a claim unpatentable, because of prior art or for other substantive reasons, the examiner issues an &quot;office action&quot; with a '''rejection''' of the claim. The applicant can either '''acquiesce''' (agree) to the rejection by deleting the claim from the application, or '''traverse''' (contest) the rejection.  Traversal can involve arguing against the rejection on scientific and/or legal grounds or amending the claim or submitting a new claim to overcome the rejection.  If the examiner considers the traversal and finds it unpersuasive, he will issue the rejection again in a &quot;final office action&quot;.  Although applicants can respond to the &quot;final office action&quot;, the examiner is not compelled to continue prosecution of the application beyond considering applications after-final response.  

If the claim is unpatentable for merely formal reasons, the examiner issues an '''objection'''. This often happens when more than one invention is claimed in a single application: in such cases, the examiner issues a &quot;restriction requirement&quot; and the inventor must divide their claims into separate applications, which are then processed on their own.

Should the applicant and the examiner reach an impasse (often demonstrated by a final office action), the applicant can file an appeal to the '''Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences''', an administrative tribunal within the Patent Office.  Alternatively, applicants may respond to a final office action by filing a continuation application, a fee, and a response to the final office action; the examiner must then issue a new office action, completing the circle of patent prosecution.  

Once all rejections of the claims or objections to the claims or the specification are overcome, the examiner issues a &quot;Notice of Allowance&quot; and a patent will be granted, if an issue fee is paid.

====Publication====

Eighteen months after its priority date, the patent application is published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  The print format of these publications appears very similar to an issued U.S. patent and published applications are often mistaken for issued patents.  The publications say &quot;United States Patent Application Publication&quot; in line 12 and have a number in the upper right corner in the format US YYYY/XXXXXXX or US YYYY/XXXXXXX A1, where YYYY is the year of publication.  Issued U.S. patents are labeled &quot;United States Patent&quot; in line 12 and are numbered US X,XXX,XXX, or lately US X,XXX,XXX B2.  Published patent applications ''are not patents and do not have the effect of patents'', they are simply a public record of the application.

===Contesting a patent===

Once a patent is granted, it can be contested in a number of ways.  One way is to produce the patented device, and then argue the patent's validity when a suit for infringement is brought.

A person may also request a '''reexamination''' of a patent by the Patent Office.  Historically, the patent office only considered prior art (e.g., documents) that were not considered in the initial examination, that is, on the face of the patent.  However, recent revisions to PTO regulations enable the PTO to consider previously considered art so long as a substantial new question of patentability is raised. 

Note that two types of reexamination exist- ex parte reexamination and inter partes reexamination.  In ex parte reexamination, a 3rd party requestor's involvement is curtailed after filing the request for reexamination.  In the case of inter partes reexamination, the requester is allowed a degree of participation- but note that estopped provisions may apply. 

Finally, a person can bring suit against the patentee in federal court for a '''declaratory judgment''' of the patent's invalidity.  As federal courts can only consider &quot;cases and controversies&quot; under article III of the constitution, a defendant seeking a declaratory judgment must demonstrate reasonable apprehension...typically in the form of threatening communications from the patentee.

==Patentability==

As described above, utility patents can be granted for '''products''' or '''processes'''. They cannot be granted for ideas; they must pertain to the application of an idea. That application must meet the basic requirements of '''utility''', '''novelty''', and '''nonobviousness'''.

===Utility [35 U.S.C. § 101]===
To be patentable, an invention must be &quot;useful.&quot; This requirement is known in patent law as '''utility'''. There are three &quot;types&quot; of utility that appear in precedent: together, they form the notion of &quot;utility&quot; as it is applied by the Patent Office.

'''General utility''' is the notion that a patentable invention must &quot;do something.&quot; It must have a useful function of some kind. In practice, it is not difficult to find a function for an invention: an invention can be purely entertaining and still be useful.

'''Specific utility''' refers to the ability of the invention to perform its function. It is the most commonly invoked form of utility. The specific utility doctrine is used to invalidate inventions such as perpetual motion machines, which may have a formal function but which are highly unlikely to fulfill that function.

'''Moral utility''' is a theory that an invention designed for an immoral purpose should not be patentable. It has not been invoked to invalidate patents in recent years, leading many to conclude that it is a dead doctrine. Some examples of moral utility:

*'''Gambling devices'''. The doctrine was used to invalidate many gambling machine patents in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A number of other patents were invalidated simply because they ''could'' be used for gambling—inventions like coin return devices and horse racing games. However, by the 1970s, gambling machines were routinely receiving patents despite the moral utility arguments.
*'''Misleading devices'''. One well-known early example was a patent for seamless stockings with fake seams: at the time (the 1920s), stockings with seams were widely viewed to be higher-quality than seamless stockings, so the fake seams were seen as an attempt to defraud consumers, and the patent was rejected. This line of jurisprudence ended in 1999, when the Federal Circuit upheld a patent for the Juicy Whip machine. The Juicy Whip is a lemonade dispenser which circulates an inert yellow liquid inside a visible tank while dispensing actual lemonade from a hidden tank below the counter: the Federal Circuit said that deceptiveness should not affect the utility of an invention.
*'''Medicines of questionable safety.''' Today, the Patent Office leaves such issues to the judgment of the FDA, and does not deny drug patents on the basis that the drug is unsafe.

===Novelty [35 U.S.C. § 102]===

35 U.S.C. § 102 governs all of the conditions for novelty.  In particular, § 102(a)-(g) govern the myriad of conditions that must be met for an invention to be novel.  The two key novelty provisions, explained below, are set out in § 102(a) and § 102(b).

====Novelty as to Invention Date====

&quot;A person shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for a patent.&quot; 35 U.S.C. § 102(a).

'''Novelty''' is the requirement that an invention be different from everything that has been published, known or marketed before.

The following definitions apply when discussing novelty and its related issues of statutory bar and priority:

*Knowledge or use by others must be in public. Personal or experimental use does not count, but giving or selling the invention to any third party usually counts as public knowledge or use, unless the third party is expressly bound to secrecy.
*Description in a printed publication occurs when the publication is made available to at least one member of the general public before the invention date of the patentee. 

====Novelty as to Filing Date - The Statutory Bar====

&quot;A person shall be entitled to a patent unless the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of the application for patent in the United States.&quot; 35 U.S.C. § 102(b).

'''Statutory bar''' is similar to novelty, but not the same. Novelty can only be destroyed by others because it is based on the date of invention. Statutory bar is based on the date of filing. The doctrine essentially prevents inventors from waiting too long to request a patent. Once an inventor patents, publishes, publicizes or sells their invention, they have only one year to file for a U.S. patent, or else they lose their right to it.

So when a magazine is sent to subscribers or a dissertation is shelved in a library, the one-year clock begins for any inventions described therein.

Another way to conceptualize statutory bar is as priority of application, while novelty is priority of invention.  That is, § 102(a) is evaluated with respect to the patentee's invention date whereas § 102(b) is evaluated with respect to patentee's filing date

====Experimental use====

'''Experimental use''' is an exception to what is considered '''public use''' for determination of whether an invention is novel or not.  An inventor can use their invention in public for experimental purposes without that use counting as &quot;public use,&quot; so long as the use is a ''bona fide'' effort to bring the invention to perfection or ensure that it will answer its designated purpose. The best known example of this exception is found in ''City of Elizabeth v. Pavement Company'', 97 U.S. 126 (1877), where an inventor tested an experimental pavement on a public street for several years. This use was held to be &quot;experimental use&quot; and novelty was not affected.

====Priority====

In the United States, a patentee must be the '''first to invent'''. This is different from many other countries where the patent is given to the '''first to file'''. To be the first to invent, the inventor must generally be:

# the first person to reduce the invention to practice
# without abandoning the invention.

There is one exception. If someone ''conceives'' the invention first but is not the first to reduce it to practice, they receive priority ''if'' they were diligent in reducing the invention to practice.

&quot;Reduction to practice&quot; is the earliest date where the inventor can prove that they produced or applied the product or process successfully. Filing for a patent is considered to be the legal equivalent of reducing to practice if no earlier date can be proven.

Occasionally, a fight will break out in the patent office to determine who was the '''first to invent''' among patentees who claim the same invention.  This fight is called an '''interference'''.  35 U.S.C. § 102(g).

===Nonobviousness===

&quot;A patent may not be obtained... if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.&quot; 35 U.S.C. § 103.

'''Nonobviousness''' adds an additional inquiry to novelty: is the invention new ''enough?'' The standard inquiry to determine nonobviousness is:

# Would the prior art suggest to those of ordinary skill in the art that they should make the claimed device or carry out the claimed process?
# Would the prior art have revealed that those of ordinary skill would have a reasonable expectation of success in doing so?

To reach this conclusion, the factfinder must examine:

# The scope and content of prior art
# The differences between the claimed invention and the prior art
# The level of ordinary skill in the art
# &quot;Objective evidence of non-obviousness&quot;&amp;mdash;commercial success, long-felt unsolved need, failure of others, copying, and unexpected results.

The case of KSR v. Teleflex, 550 U.S. 398, 127 S. Ct. 1727 (2007), raised the threshold considerably as to what is considered nonobvious.  Now, applicants must meet a higher bar to show patentability of their inventions.

==Infringement==
===Literal infringement===

Literal infringement is found when a person makes, uses, sells, offers for sale or imports an invention described in the claims of someone else's patent. The invention must contain every element of at least one claim in order to infringe the patent: if it fails to meet any part of the claim, it does not infringe that claim.

===Infringement by equivalents===

Even if the invention does not meet the literal criteria of a claim, it can infringe that claim by '''equivalents'''. To do so, it must have the &quot;substantial equivalent&quot; of every limitation or element of the claim.  The general test for whether an element in an accused infringing device is an equivalent of a recited claim element is whether the element satifies the triple-identity test.  In short, the triple-identity test requires that the equivalent element perform the recited claim element in the same way, to perform the same function, to achieve the same result.

The doctrine of equivalents has certain limits. That is, the doctrine of equivalents cannot be used to expand a claim to an extent that would have made the claim invalid. It cannot, for instance, broaden the claim to include prior art.  Further, the doctrine of '''prosecution history estoppel''' prohibits the recapture of claim scope that was given up during prosecution.  That is, if the patentee gave up claim scope during the negociation process with a USPTO examiner to overcome prior art rejections, the patentee cannot regain this scope later on during litigation by claiming equivalency under the doctrine of equivalents.

One difficult area for equivalents doctrine is improvements in technology. Claims are sometimes interpreted to include new technological advances that do not literally fall within their scope. For example, the patent for a light beam-assisted pipe-laying tool was held to cover laser-assisted tools as well in ''Laser Alignment v. Woodruff &amp; Sons'', 491 F.2d 866 (7th Cir. 1974). But other patents have not received protection under equivalents doctrine based on an '''entirety of the technology''' argument. A Texas Instruments patent on handheld calculators was not extended to cover models with MOS transistors and LCD readouts, on the grounds that &quot;all of the claimed functions are performed in the accused devices by subsequently developed or improved means.&quot; ''Tex. Instruments v. U.S. Intl. Trade Commn.'', 805 F.2d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1986).

===Contributory infringement===

&quot;Whoever offers to sell or sells within the United States or imports into the United States a component of a patented machine, manufacture, combination or composition, or a material or apparatus for use in practicing a patented process, constituting a material part of the invention, knowing the same to be especially made or especially adapted for use in an infringement of such patent, and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, shall be liable as a contributory infringer.&quot; 35 U.S.C. § 271(c).

Unlike direct infringement, contributory infringement requires knowledge of the patent's existence. 

A related concept is '''inducement'''. &quot;Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.&quot; 35 U.S.C. § 271(b). Inducement can be found in a variety of activities: telling someone to violate a patent, selling parts to builders of infringing devices, and so on.

===Defenses===
====Noninfringement====

Obviously, one defense to infringment is simply that the defendant products or processes do not infringe the plaintiff's patents.

====Invalidity====

The defense of invalidity argues that the patent should not have been issued as a patent in the first place because the invention is not novel or is obvious.  One example of patent invalidity would be where the defendant can show a printed publication that completely describes the invention before the invention date of the patentee.  This defense is usually more difficult to prove than noninfringement, because the patentee is given a presumption of validity on the patent once it issues.  Therefore, to invalidate a patent, a defendant must show patent invalidity by '''clear and convincing evidence''', a much harder standard to overcome than the usual '''preponderance of the evidence''' or '''more likely than not''' standard.

====Inequitable conduct====

If a patent is obtained through '''inequitable conduct''' or '''fraud on the patent office''', it may be rendered unenforceable (but not invalid). Patent applications that contain blatant falsehoods or omissions (e.g. concealing prior art known to the inventor) can lead to the entire patent being rendered unenforceable.

====Patent misuse====

'''Patent misuse''' refers to the use of a patent to illegally stifle competition: it is closely tied to antitrust law. The doctrine was first applied in ''Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.'', 243 U.S. 502 (1917), where manufacturers licensed a film projector patent under the condition that the projectors must be licensed to end users so that they could only be used with films covered by the manufacturers' patent. A finding of patent misuse renders the entire patent unenforceable until the misuse is purged.

Generally, patent misuse prohibits the misuse of a patent through prolonging the duration of the patent beyond its expiration and tying the products not covered by the a patent's claims to the patent.  For example, requiring a licensee of a patent to accept a contract duration for royalty payments over a 25 year term when only 10 years remain on a patent's term would be prohibited extension of the patent beyond its expiration.  An example of tying misuse would be requiring licensees to sell certain accessories with a patented product and requiring licensees to pay royalties on the accessories that are not non-covered by the patent's claims.

===Remedies for infringement===
====Injunctions [35 U.S.C. § 283]====

Following a complaint for infringement, a court can issue a '''preliminary injunction''' to stop the accused infringing action. The Federal Circuit has enunciated several factors that should be considered to decide whether a preliminary injunction should issue:

# Reasonable probability of eventual success in the litigation
# Complainant will be irreparably injured if relief is not granted
# Possibility of harm to others from the grant or denial of the injunction (optional)
# Public interest militating in favor of or against injunction (optional)

If the complainant prevails at trial, a '''permanent injunction''' against the infringement is almost always issued.

====Damages [35 U.S.C. § 284]====

Damages for patent infringement are generally '''lost profits''', which are based on (1) demand for the product; (2) presence or absence of non-infringing substitutes; (3) the patent holder's manufacturing or marketing capacity to exploit demand; and (4) and the amount of profit the patent holder would have made. &lt;I&gt;Panduit Corp. v. Stahlin Bros. Fibre Works&lt;/I&gt;, 575 F.2d 1152, 1156 (6th Cir. 1978).

::Demand for the patented product can usually be presumed from infringement itself. The fact that there were buyers who wanted the product and willing to pay the infringer’s price proves demand.

::The absence of noninfringing alternatives assures loss causation because, in the absence of infringing products, the demand could only be satisfied by the patentee's products. Courts tend to avoid speculative damage awards; therefore the patentee must show a reasonable likelihood that without the infringement it would have made the infringer’s sales. One factor is whether the alternatives proposed by the defendant compete in the same market for the same customers as the patented device. The alleged alternative must also not sell at a disproportionately higher price than the patented device. Finally, the availability of non-infringing alternatives may not preclude all recovery if, in a multi vendor marketplace, the patentee can show a reasonable market share with modest assumptions.

::The patentee must also show that it had, or could have obtained the manufacturing and marketing capability to make all the sales in question. It can satisfy this factor by reliance not only on its own manufacturing capability, but also by evidence of the potential for licensing and contracting for the manufacture.

::Finally, the amount of profits must be calculated using an incremental income approach that excludes the patentee’s fixed costs.
:::Lost Profits = Lost Revenues – Incremental Costs
:::Lost Revenues = the number of additional sales that the patentee would have made without the infringement, multiplied by the plaintiff’s historical (pre-infringement) prices
:::Incremental Costs = the number of additional sales that the patentee would have made without the infringement, multiplied by the variable cost per unit

:A patent owner can also potentially recover lost profits on lost sales of ''unpatented'' products (or products covered by patents other than the one in question) that compete with the infringing device, so long as the patentee can establish loss causation. &lt;I&gt;Rite-Hite Corp. v. Kelley Co.&lt;/I&gt;, 56 F.3d 1538, 1545(1995).

:The patentee may also seek to recover damages for the lost profits he would have made on ''accessory items'' that typically are purchased with the patented item. For these ''tag-along'' or ''convoyed'' sales, the ''Rite-Hite'' court held that those damages may also be recoverable. For such recovery, however, all of the components (patented item and the tag-along items) must work as a functional unit.  If the tag-along items and the patented item can function as stand-alone products, then this type of damages may not be recoverable

:As part of '''lost profits''', the patentee may seek damages for '''price erosion''' in the patent holder's selling prices which is caused by the alleged infringement by creating competing supply of products or services. As with lost damages, the patentee seeking price erosion damages must prove causation, i.e. but for the infringement, it would have sold the products at a higher price. The patentee may fail if the accuser can show that the price erosion was due to factors other that the presence of the infringer in the marketplace, such as changing consumer preferences or an influx of imported products.

If lost profits cannot be proven, a '''reasonable royalty''' analysis can be substituted, in which damages are based on the amount a manufacturer would pay on the market for a license to produce the patented article. § 284 provides that the reasonable royalty is the minimum or floor below which the damages assessment cannot go. In analyzing how much is reasonable, courts may ask what the royalties would have been in a hypothetical negotiated license at the time of first infringement. The following factors are generally considered: (1) other competitors; (2) number of licenses; (3) future business and profit the patentee would lose by licensing to a competitor (cannibalization); and (4) how central the patent is to what is being marketed. Alternatively, courts may use the analytical approach and take the infringer’s net profit margin, leave it an “industry standard” profit and give the rest back to the patentee as reasonable royalty.

§ 284 also provides for '''enhanced damages''' up to three times ('''treble damages''') in exceptional cases. The standard for enhanced damages is willful infringement demonstrated by egregious conduct based on facts and circumstances, i.e. deliberate copying. Although a good faith belief of non-infringement, such as an opinion letter from outside counsel may shield a defendant from enhanced damages, the defendant may still be liable for actual damages discussed above.

In addition to § 284 damages, a defendant, under § 285, may have to pay '''attorney fees''' if defendant (generally through its attorneys) commits litigation misconduct that is exceptionally bad, such as tampering with evidence, frivolous lawsuit or defenses. Attorney fees award amount usually bears some relation to the extent of the misconduct in question.

==Exploitation of Patents==
Because patents are a property right, they may be owned or transferred to another much like any other property right.

To transfer ownership of a patent, one &quot;assigns&quot; the patent to another.

A patent may also be licensed. A license provides permission for another party to engage in conduct that would otherwise be infringing.

'''Trademarks''' are distinguishing devices used by businesses to distinguish their goods and services from those produced by others. They are a basic form of '''intellectual property'''.

This text outlines trademark law as it applies in the United States.

==Introduction==
===History of trademark law===

Although trademarks are the oldest form of intellectual property and have been protected at common law for decades, they were the last to be protected by a federal statute in the US, and infringement cases were very rare until the late 19th century.

The first trademark statute, enacted in 1870, was struck down by the Supreme Court in ''The Trade-Mark Cases'', 100 U.S. 82 (1879), for exceeding the powers granted by the patent and copyright clause of the Constitution. Congress responded with the '''Trademark Act of 1881''', which was based on its Commerce Clause powers.

The current federal trademark statute is the '''Lanham Act of 1946''', codified in Title 15 of the United States Code.

===&amp;reg; or &amp;trade; or &amp;#x2120;?===

The Lanham Act establishes a procedure for federal '''registration''' of trademarks. If a trademark meets certain qualifications, it can be listed on the '''Principal Register''', which affords it many benefits. Other trademarks can be listed on the '''Supplemental Register''', which exists to allow trademarks not otherwise registrable in the United States to be registered from foreign countries that require home-country registration first, and to allow registration for descriptive marks not distinctive enough to qualify for the Principal Register. Registration is not mandatory to receive trademark protection, but federal trademarks on the Principal Register receive significantly stronger protection than unregistered trademarks. Federal registration is not mandatory to receive trademark protection, but a mark owner seeking to enforce trademarks in US federal court needs either a federal registration or a violation of the Lanham Act's specific sections on '''false advertising''' or '''unfair competition'''. 

Federal registration is limited to trademarks and service marks being used by the mark owner in '''interstate commerce'''. Among other criteria, federal registered trademarks may not be &quot;immoral, deceptive or scandalous,&quot; or &quot;disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, institutions, beliefs or national symbols.&quot; They may not be &quot;merely descriptive,&quot; &quot;deceptively misdescriptive,&quot; &quot;primarily geographically misdescriptive,&quot; &quot;primarily merely a surname,&quot; or &quot;functional&quot; without proof of secondary meaning. See 15 U.S.C. § 1052.

In addition to federal registration, each of the fifty US states has its own system of trademark registration. If a trademark meets the state's qualifications, it can be listed on the state's registry of trademarks. State registration is not mandatory to receive trademark protection or to use a state's court system to enforce trademark rights. The US federal and state trademark registration systems co-exist side-by-side. It is possible for a state-registered trademark, or a common law unregistered trademark, to have rights superior to a trademark with a valid federal registration, due to an earlier date of adoption combined with actual and continuous use.

Only trademarks on the Principal Register and the Supplemental Register can be marked with the &amp;reg; symbol to denote their higher level of protection. Any trademark, including unregistered trademarks or trademarks on the Principal or Supplemental Register, can be marked with the &amp;trade; or &amp;#x2120; (service mark) symbol. These symbols exist to place third parties on notice that they may infringe the trademark by using it without authorization.

==Types of protected mark==

Trademark law protects '''marks'''. Marks can be words, names, symbols or devices. They come in several classes:

===Trademark===

Strictly speaking, a '''trademark''' is a mark that distinguishes one person's goods from others'. In practice, the word &quot;trademark&quot; is often used to refer to any class of mark that is protected under trademark law.

===Service mark===

A '''service mark''' is similar to a trademark, except that it is used to distinguish one person's services from others'. Service marks are registrable in the same manner as trademarks and are denoted by the &amp;reg; symbol once they are registered on the Principal or Supplemental Registers. If they are not registered, they often carry an SM symbol.

===Trade name===

A '''trade name''' is a mark used to identify a business, as opposed to a good or service. The Lanham Act does not allow trade names to be registered unless they also function as trademarks or service marks by identifying the source of a good or service. However, many states allow trade names to be registered and protected under state law.

===Certification mark===

A '''certification mark''' is a mark used to certify a good in some way, regardless of its specific source. Seals of approval (e.g. the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval) and marks of origin (e.g. Roquefort cheese) are examples of certification marks. A certification mark is held by an organization and is protected under trademark law so long as the holder establishes a standard for awarding the mark and polices that standard effectively.

===Collective mark===

A '''collective mark''' is a mark held by a group for the use of its members. Examples include union stamps and franchise marks. Collective marks are treated like regular trademarks and service marks under the Lanham Act.

===Trade dress and product configuration===

'''Trade dress''' refers to the distinctive packaging of a product. One example of trade dress is the decor of a restaurant chain. Trade dress is protected if it is inherently distinctive.

'''Product configuration''' refers to the distinctive design and shape of a product. The best-known example is the glass Coca-Cola bottle. A product configuration must have '''secondary meaning''' to be protected, regardless of whether it is inherently distinctive or not. Secondary meaning means that the appearance of the product should indicate its source to a consumer.

Both trade dress and product configuration can be registered as trademarks, but they are more often protected without registration as a &quot;false designation of origin&quot; under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a). They pose special problems in trademark law because of their non-verbal nature. Words are easy to protect: more abstract designs are not.

==Trademarkability==
===Distinctiveness===

Marks in the form of words can be classified as either '''arbitrary''', '''fanciful''', '''suggestive''', '''descriptive''' or '''generic'''. The nature of the mark determines the extent to which it is protected by law.

====Arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive marks====

A &quot;fanciful&quot; mark has no meaning other than its meaning as a trademark. Examples include Xerox copiers, Lego bricks and Verizon phones. &quot;Arbitrary&quot; marks have a separate meaning, but that meaning has nothing to do with their use as a trademark. Examples include Apple computers, Diesel jeans and Shell gasoline. &quot;Suggestive&quot; marks suggest a characteristic of a good or service without actually describing that characteristic. Examples include Coppertone sunblock, Earthlink internet service and jetBlue airline service.

Arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive marks receive highly similar treatment under the law. They are the strongest types of mark in that their holders do not need to prove a secondary meaning in order to protect the mark. Because there is no reason to associate Apple with computers, outside of the popularity of computers made by Apple Computer, third parties have few legitimate reasons to use the name &quot;Apple&quot; on their computers.

====Descriptive marks====

A &quot;descriptive&quot; mark is one that identifies a characteristic of the article or service it marks. Examples include American Airlines (a '''geographic mark''') and Dell Computer (a '''surname mark'''). Descriptive marks cannot be registered without proof that the mark has a secondary meaning in the eye of the consumer public.

Even if a descriptive mark has a secondary meaning, its descriptive nature makes it possible to avoid trademark infringement liability through a '''fair use''' defense. A person could, for instance, use &quot;American Airlines&quot; in a commercial context to refer to airlines from America, so long as they were not using the term in its trademark sense.

====Generic marks====

Generic marks, like &quot;laptop computer,&quot; ''cannot'' receive trademark protection even if they have a secondary meaning. The rule against generic trademarks is particularly important for holders of famous marks, because their marks may lose protection if they become common nouns or adjectives in the public eye. Formerly-trademarked words like &quot;aspirin&quot; and &quot;cellophane&quot; have lost their protection due to '''genericide'''. Genericide is discussed in detail in the Defenses section.

====Non-verbal marks====

A mark need not be a word or phrase. Besides trade dress and product configuration, discussed above, trademarks can also be found in sounds (e.g. the NBC chimes), colors, fragrances, and other distinctive features of a product. The most important criteria in determining their trademarkability is secondary meaning (whether the feature denotes origin to consumers) and whether the feature is '''functional'''. Functional features are not trademarkable: they must be protected under patent law if they are to be protected at all.

===Priority===

Generally speaking, the owner of a mark is the person who is first to use that mark in commerce. This is known as the '''race to the marketplace''' test. For unregistered marks, protection only extends to the areas where marked products are sold or advertised, where their reputation is established, or where the owner is reasonably expected to reach in the normal expansion of their business. Registered marks automatically receive nationwide protection regardless of where they are used.

If two people use the same mark in the same region, the right to use the mark will be given to the first person to use the mark in that region. If one of the marks is registered, the unregistered mark will only prevail if it was in use before the application for the registered mark was filed, and the unregistered mark will only prevail in the area(s) where it was in use.

==Infringement==
===Confusion===

Confusion is one of the main grounds for a trademark infringement claim. It can take many forms, but the basic inquiry generally involves the same questions:

# How strong is the mark being defended?
# How similar are the products in question?
# How similar are the marks in question?
# Have consumers actually been confused?
# Which marketing channels have been used?
# How likely is the consumer to exercise care when purchasing the products in question?
# What was the defendant's intent in selecting the mark?
# How likely are the product lines to expand?

See ''AMF v. Sleekcraft Boats'', 599 F.2d 341 (9th Cir. 1979). Different circuit courts use slightly different tests in determining likelihood of confusion.

Infringement by confusion can involve:

*'''Confusion between related products'''. If one product is offered under a mark similar or identical to another, and the products would be confused by the buying public if sold under the same mark, trademark infringement can be found. Examples from actual infringement cases include Slickcraft and Sleekcraft boats, Bonamine and Dramamine medications, Pledge and Promise cleaners, and Duron and Durox paints. 
*'''Confusion as to source'''. Confusion can also be found when the same or similar mark is applied to different types of goods. One early case, involving Borden milk and Borden ice cream, was deemed to be non-infringing in 1912; in more recent years, such cases have routinely led to findings of infringement.
*'''Confusion as to sponsorship'''. Even where consumers are unlikely to be confused as to source, they may be confused as to sponsorship. Team logo merchandise is a common example; consumers may expect that they are supporting the New York Yankees by purchasing a Yankees cap.
*'''Initial interest confusion'''. Sometimes, famous marks are used to lure consumers to different businesses. &quot;Cybersquatting&quot; by registering a well-known trademark as a domain name is one well-known example. Another is the use of meta tags to fool search engines: a little-known adult Web site may attempt to attract visitors by showing up in web searches for more well-known adult entertainment franchises. Both activities can be considered trademark infringement by confusion.
*'''Post-sale confusion'''. Post-sale confusion is often used to find infringement in counterfeit goods, such as fake watches and handbags. While the purchaser is likely to understand that they are buying a counterfeit product, the aim is to confuse others into thinking the product comes from a different source.
*'''Reverse confusion'''. Although confusion cases generally involve a little-known business using a well-known mark, confusion can also be found when a well-known business uses a little-known mark.

===Dilution===

Trademark infringement can also be found in the absence of any confusion at all. Many trademarks are deemed to have a distinctive quality, and any third-party use that diminishes this distinctiveness is considered to be '''dilution''', which is an independent cause of action from traditional infringement. Traditional types of distinction include '''blurring''', in which the diluter lessens the ability of the mark to uniquely identify one source of goods or services, and '''tarnishment''', in which the diluter associates the mark with scandalous or obscene material, thus attacking the good character of the mark or its owner.

The textbook case of dilution is ''Eastman Photographic Materials v. Kodak Cycle'', 15 R.P.C. 105 (Eng. 1898), in which the maker of Kodak cameras brought suit against a company producing Kodak bicycles. There was little chance of cameras being confused with bicycles: the risk was removing the Kodak name's association with cameras.

The '''Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995''' added a dilution statute to the Lanham Act. Dilution can be found whenever a &quot;famous mark&quot; is used by another, &quot;if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark.&quot; 15 U.S.C. 1125(c). However, a recent law has made significant changes to the Federal dilution statute. [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h683enr.txt.pdf]

===Contributory infringement===

Trademark law has a contributory infringement doctrine similar to those under [[US Patent Law#Contributory infringement|patent law]] and [[US Copyright Law#Contributory and vicarious infringement|copyright law]]. Unlike its sister doctrines, however, contributory infringement of trademarks is not a very well-developed doctrine. It has come up in a few contexts, including cybersquatting liability and liability for landlords whose tenants sell counterfeit goods.

===Defenses to infringement===

====Genericide====

Many trademarks have been invalidated because they have lapsed from fanciful, arbitrary, suggestive or descriptive status to generic status. '''Genericide''' is a defense to trademark infringement: the use of a trademark that has become generic over time is not infringement. Examples include:

* aspirin; ''Bayer Co. v. United Drug Co.'', 272 F. 505 (S.D.N.Y. 1921).
* cellophane; ''DuPont Cellophane Co. v. Waxed Products Co.'', 85 F.2d 75 (2d Cir. 1936).
* shredded wheat; ''Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.'', 305 U.S. 111 (1938).
* thermos; ''King-Seeley Thermos Co. v. Aladdin Industries'', 321 F.2d 577 (2d Cir. 1973).
* Murphy bed; ''Murphy Bed Door Co. v. Interior Sleep Systems'', 874 F.2d 95 (2d Cir. 1989).
* Pilates; ''Pilates, Inc. v. Current Concepts, Inc.'', 120 F.Supp 2d 286 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).
* Pilates Studio; ''Pilates Method Alliance, Inc. v. Pilates, Inc.'', Opposition No. 91154584 (TTAB 2004).

Many companies, notably Xerox, Jeep and Lego, have active campaigns to avoid the genericide of their trademarks: they insist that their marks be used as adjectives, not nouns, so as to avoid their trademarks becoming common terms for copying machines and interlocking blocks respectively. Xerox regularly engages in corrective advertising. In the late 1980's, Jeep after being acquired by Chrysler convinced the automobile industry to adopt the term SUV for 4-wheel drive vehicles, and has since engaged in a continuous advertising that &quot;There is only one Jeep&quot; to reinforce the JEEP brand.

====Functionality====

The original ''Trade-Mark Cases'' invalidated Congress's first trademark statute on the grounds that trademark authority could not be based on the patent and copyright clause of the Constitution. There is still a sharp divide between patent and trademark law, illustrated by the doctrine that functional marks cannot be protected as trademarks. As stated above, '''functionality''' is most common when defending claims for infringement of trade dress and product configuration.

====Abandonment====

Under the Lanham Act as amended in 1994, a mark is deemed &quot;abandoned&quot; &quot;when its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume such use.&quot; Nonuse for three consecutive years is considered prima facie evidence of abandonment. 15 U.S.C. § 1127.

Some famous trademarks have been preserved through minor use by other companies. US Airways, for instance, preserves the trademarks of well-known but defunct Piedmont Airlines and PSA by operating some of its commuter flights under those names, and Chevron maintains the Standard Oil trademark by operating a small number of its filling stations under the Standard name.

====Non-trademark use====

Use of a mark is only infringing if the mark is used ''as'' a mark. For instance, mentioning a mark in an article is generally not infringement. Using a mark as the basis of a song is generally not infringement (&quot;Barbie Girl&quot;; see ''Mattel v. MCA Records'', 296 F.3d 894 (9th Cir. 2002)). Likewise, mentioning a mark in the title of a work, as in ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree'' or ''The Devil Wears Prada'', is generally not infringement. However, using ''Star Trek'' in the title of an unauthorized book about Star Trek would likely infringe the mark, since the mark is used on other books authorized by its holder.

===Remedies===
====Injunction====

Injunctions are a standard remedy for trademark infringement. The usual injunction is to halt production and sale of infringing goods and services.

In some cases, the court might also award an injunction for '''corrective advertising''', which forces the defendant to pay for an amount of advertising necessary to reverse the damage to the plaintiff's mark.

====Damages====

Under 15 U.S.C. § 1117, a court may award damages for trademark infringement reflecting some combination of the following factors.  Trebled damages are available for damage amounts derived from defendant's profits, actual damages plaintiff sustained, and cost of bringing the lawsuit.

:# defendant's profits (15 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1))
:# damages sustained by the plaintiff (15 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(2))
:# cost of bringing the lawsuit (may include attorney's fees) (15 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(3))
:# prejudgment interest (15 U.S.C. § 1117(b))
:# statutory damages (15 U.S.C. § 1117(d)

'''Defendant's Profits:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Plaintiff is required only to prove the amount of defendant's sales. The burden then shifts to defendant to prove up its costs and expenses to be deducted from the total sales amount to give the amount of defendant's profits. If the court finds the recovery amount based on defendant's profits is inadequate or excessive, the court may enter judgment a sum it believes is just in light of the &quot;circumstances of the case.&quot; 

'''Damages Sustained by Plaintiff:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Plaintiff must prove up its actual damages. The court bases its determination of damages on the actual amount of damages plaintiff's has proven or any sum above that amount but not more than  three times above the actual damage amount.

'''Costs of the Action:'''&lt;br /&gt;
The court may also award reasonable attorney's fees to the winning party but only in exceptional circumstances.

'''Trebling of Damages:'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the case of a counterfeit mark or designation (as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 1116(d)), non-statutory damage amounts are to be trebled unless the court finds &quot;extenuating circumstances.&quot;  Note that Congress intended for courts to award trebled damages in most cases.&lt;br /&gt;
Specifically, the Lanham Act says where plaintiff has proven any violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)(a) or 36 U.S.C. § 220506, a court shall enter judgment for three times such profits or damages, whichever amount is greater, together with a reasonable attorney’s fee, if the violation consists of:
:(1) intentionally using a mark or designation, knowing such mark or designation is a counterfeit mark (as defined in 15 U.S.C. §1116 (d))), in connection with the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of goods or services; or&lt;br /&gt;
:(2) providing goods or services necessary to the commission of a violation specified in paragraph (1), with the intent that the recipient of the goods or services would put the goods or services to use in committing the violation.

'''Prejudgment Interest:'''&lt;br /&gt;
The court may also award interest beginning from the date of the service of the plaintiff’s pleadings setting forth the claim for such entry of judgment and ending on the date such entry is made, or for such shorter time as the court considers appropriate. (''See'' 26 U.S.C. §6621 (a)(2) for method of determining interest rate).

'''Statutory Damages:'''&lt;br /&gt;
15 U.S.C. § 1117(c) provides a plaintiff the option of electing (before final judgment) recovery of statutory damages for any such use.  The statutory damages are based upon the &quot;willfulness&quot; of the counterfeit:

:(1) if the court finds the use of the counterfeit mark was not willful, the statutory damages will be not less than $1,000 or more than $200,000 per counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court considers just; or&lt;br /&gt;
:(2) if the court finds that the use of the counterfeit mark was willful, not more than $2,000,000 per counterfeit mark per type of goods or services sold, offered for sale, or distributed, as the court considers just.

This statutory amount is in lieu of and not in addition to profits or actual damages; and is not subject to trebling under 15 U.S.C. § 1117(b).

====Criminal counterfeiting====

Knowingly copying another's trademark is considered '''counterfeiting''' and is a felony punishable by fines and imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 2320.

      <comment>Changed the description for the behavior of cron when /etc/cron.allow and  /etc/cron.deny files are missing on different Linux distributions</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Scheduling with Cron ==

Cron is an automated scheduler in UNIX/Linux Systems, which executes jobs (scripts) which are scheduled by system, root, or individual users. Information of schedules is contained within crontab file (which is different and individual for each user). When the cron daemon starts, it searches for crontab files, which are user named account names in /var/cron/tabs directory. Cron daemon wakes up every minute and checks for any jobs scheduled to be executed in crontab files. Every time cron daemon wakes up to check crontab files, it also checks /etc/crontab file for any modifications in time stamp of the file, which it keeps track and records. When you simply 'touch' /etc/crontab file, cron daemon will catch it and ultimately stop executing scheduled jobs in crontabs - this is how to stop cron daemon. In order to have cron daemon continue running scheduled jobs, you need to restart it (bounce it).

===Controlling access with 'cron.allow' and 'cron.deny'===

* Access will be granted when user is listed in file /etc/cron.allow
* Otherwise, access will be denied if username  is found in /etc/cron.deny
* If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to have access, or all users will have access. 
:* For standard Debian systems (including Ubuntu), all users will be granted access when neither file exists.
:* For Fedora systems, only the super user will be granted access when neither file exists. 



===Four places to submit a cron job===

# The /var/spool/cron/username file: each individual user (indicated by username) controls his or her own separate file
# The /etc/crontab file: This is '''system crontab''' file. Only root has permission to modify this file.
# The /etc/cron.d directory. Each file placed in this directory has the same format as the /etc/crontab. Only root has permission to create or modify the files in this directory. 
# The /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly, and /etc/cron.monthly directories
#* Each file in these directories is a shell script that runs at the times specified in the /etc/crontab file (by default at one minute after the hour, at 4:02 a.m. every day, Sunday at 4:22 a.m., and 4:42 a.m. on the first day of the month, respectively )
#* Only root has permission to create or modify the files in these directories.

=== Crontab format ===

 * * * * * command to be executed
 - - - - -
 | | | | |
 | | | | ----- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0)
 | | | ------- month (1 - 12)
 | | --------- day of month (1 - 31)
 | ----------- hour (0 - 23)
  ------------ min (0 - 59)

# An asterisk (*) in any field indicates all possible values for that field.
# Lists of values, ranges of values, and increments can be used. Examples:
#* Lists: Days could be represented as the '''list Mon,Wed,Fri'''.
#* Range: Hours can be specified as '''range 9–5'''
#* Increment: '''0–31/3in''' the third field to represent every third day of the month
#* '''*/5''' denotes every five minutes
# Any variable can be specified to fine−tune the environment in which the job will run. Example:
#* '''MAILTO=otheruser''' variable enable to send email to user other than the one who submitted the cron job

=== Commands ===

# '''crontab −l''' : list the current contents of your own personal crontab file
# '''crontab −r''' : remove all crontab entries
# '''crontab −e''' : edit crontab file
# '''ps -e |grep cron''' : Displays status of cron daemon if running.
# '''/usr/sbin/cron &amp;''' : Starts users cron daemon.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called BrDanIzzo. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name BrDanIzzo~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Formal or informal, '''Spinach Artichoke Dip''' is a great appetizer at any party. It is quick and easy taking very little time to prepare. The dip may be served with a variety or crackers, breads, or chips. 

==Ingredients==
* 16 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (450g) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
* 3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (180ml) heavy [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (use half milk, if desired) 
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (80ml) grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] 
*1/4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (60ml) [[Cookbook:garlic|garlic powder]] 
* 16 [[Cookbook:Ounce|ounces]] (450g) frozen cut leaf [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]], thawed and well drained 
* 1 can quartered [[Cookbook:artichoke|artichoke hearts]], rinsed and well drained 
*2/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (160ml) shredded [[Cookbook:Monterey Jack Cheese|Monterey Jack cheese]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] prepared (240ml) [[Cookbook:salsa|salsa]] 
* Crackers or [[Cookbook:Tortilla Chip|tortilla chips]], for serving

==Procedure==
#In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, process the cream cheese, cream, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder until smooth and creamy. Add the spinach and process until thoroughly mixed. Add the artichokes and process just until coarsely chopped.
#Turn the mixture into a 3 1/2-quart electric slow cooker; smooth the top.
#Cover and cook on the high heat setting 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours, until hot in the center. Sprinkle the top evenly with the Jack cheese and spoon the salsa in a ring around the inside edges of the slow cooker. Cover and continue heating on high 15 minutes longer, or until the cheese is melted. Reduce the heat to the low setting and serve warm with crackers or tortilla chips for dipping. Refrigerate any leftovers.

==Notes, tips and variations==
*Best served if hot but may also be served chilled. 
*If served in a bread bowl, pieces may be broken off and used as dipping tools for further enjoyment. 
*Other condiments that go great with this dip include sides of salsa, guacamole, or sour cream. 
*This is great appetizer for vegetarians and vegan cream cheese may be substituted if need be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General idea ==

Assume you have observed absolute frequencies &lt;math&gt;o_i&lt;/math&gt; and expected absolute frequencies &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; under the Null hypothesis of your test then it holds

&lt;math&gt;V = \sum_i \frac{(o_i-e_i)^2}{e_i} \approx \chi^2_f .&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; might denote a simple index running from &lt;math&gt;1,...,I&lt;/math&gt; or even a multiindex &lt;math&gt;(i_1,...,i_p)&lt;/math&gt; running from &lt;math&gt;(1,...,1)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(I_1,...,I_p)&lt;/math&gt;.

The test statistics &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is approximately &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; distributed, if

# for all absolute expected frequencies &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;e_i \geq 1&lt;/math&gt; and
# for at least 80% of the absolute expected frequencies &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;e_i \geq 5&lt;/math&gt;.

Note: In different books you might find different approximation conditions, please feel free to add further ones.

The degrees of freedom can be computed by the numbers of absolute observed frequencies which can be chosen freely. We know that the sum of absolute expected frequencies is

&lt;math&gt; \sum_i o_i = n &lt;/math&gt;

which means that the maximum number of degrees of freedom is &lt;math&gt;I-1&lt;/math&gt;. We might have to subtract from the number of degrees of freedom the number of parameters we need to estimate from the sample, since this implies further relationships between the observed frequencies.

== Derivation of the distribution of the test statistic ==

Following  Boero, Smith and Wallis (2002) we need knowledge about multivariate statistics to understand the derivation.

The random variable &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; describing the absolute observed frequencies &lt;math&gt;(o_1, ..., o_k)&lt;/math&gt; in a sample has a multinomial distribution &lt;math&gt;O \sim M(n;p_1,...,p_k)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the number of observations in the sample, &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; the unknown true probabilities. With certain approximation conditions (central limit theorem) it holds that

&lt;math&gt;O \sim M(n; p_1,...,p_k) \approx N_k(\mu;\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt; 

with &lt;math&gt;N_k&lt;/math&gt; the multivariate &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; dimensional normal distribution, &lt;math&gt;\mu = (np_1,...,np_k)&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma = (\sigma_{ij})_{i,j=1,...,k} = \begin{cases} -np_ip_j, &amp; \mbox{if } i\neq j \\  np_i(1-p_i) &amp; \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.

The covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; has only rank &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;p_1+...+p_k = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

If we considered the generalized inverse &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^-&lt;/math&gt; then it holds that

&lt;math&gt;(O-\mu)^T \Sigma^- (O-\mu) = \sum_i \frac{(o_i-e_i)^2}{e_i} \sim \chi^2_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

distributed (for a proof see Pringle and Rayner, 1971).

Since the multinomial distribution is approximately multivariate normal distributed, the term is

&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \frac{(o_i-e_i)^2}{e_i} \approx \chi^2_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;

distributed. If further relations between the observed probabilities are there then the rank of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; will decrease further.

A common situation is that parameters on which the expected probabilities depend needs to be estimated from the observed data. As said above, usually is stated that the degrees of freedom for the chi square distribution is &lt;math&gt;k-1-r&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the number of estimated parameters.
In case of parameter estimation with the maximum-likelihood method this is only true if the estimator is efficient (Chernoff and Lehmann, 1954). In general it holds that degrees of freedom are somewhere between &lt;math&gt;k-1-r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==

The most famous examples will be handled in detail at further sections: &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test for independence, &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test for homogeneity and &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test for distributions.

The &lt;math&gt;\chi^2&lt;/math&gt; test can be used to generate &quot;quick and dirty&quot; test, e.g.

&lt;math&gt;H_0:&lt;/math&gt; The random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is symmetrically distributed versus

&lt;math&gt;H_1:&lt;/math&gt; the random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not symmetrically distributed.

We know that in case of a symmetrical distribution the arithmetic mean &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}&lt;/math&gt; and median should be nearly the same. So a simple way to test this hypothesis would be to count how many observations  are less than the mean (&lt;math&gt;n_-&lt;/math&gt;)and how many observations are larger than the arithmetic mean (&lt;math&gt;n_+&lt;/math&gt;). If mean and median are the same than 50% of the observation should smaller than the mean and 50% should be larger than the mean. It holds

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{(n_- - n/2)^2}{n/2} + \frac{(n_+ - n/2)^2}{n/2} \approx \chi^2_1&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Connecting to the Internet using BSNL Prepaid GPRS''' ==

BSNL has come out with the option of GPRS over the prepaid connection. But difficulties were faced by many to connect to the Internet. Even the settings that were downloaded from BSNL site failed the phone to connect to the Internet. The following is the actual working settings on a [http://www.nokiausa.com/A4410642 Nokia3650] phone so that it would connect through GPRS.
 
Steps to be followed to browse Internet over GPRS using a BSNL South India Prepaid Connection: 
 
* Message “GPRSPRE” (SMS) &lt;''without quotes''&gt; to 53733. 
* After sometime (may take up to 48 hrs) a message would be received saying that GPRS has been activated for the phone.  
* Press the menu button of your phone; go to Tools '''-&gt;''' Settings '''-&gt;''' Connection '''-&gt;''' Access Points.  
* Click on Options. Select New Access Point '''-&gt;''' Use Default Settings 
* Give the following values: 
   - Connection Name               -&gt; '''BSNL GPRS''' 
   - Data Bearer                   -&gt; '''GPRS''' 
   - Access Point Name             -&gt; '''bsnlnet''' 
   - User Name                     -&gt; 
   - Prompt Password               -&gt; '''No''' 
   - Password                      -&gt; 
   - Authentication                -&gt; '''Normal''' 
   - Gateway IP Address            -&gt; 
   - Homepage                      -&gt; '''http://bsnl.co.in/''' 
   - Connection Security           -&gt; '''On''' 
   - Session Mode                  -&gt; '''Permanent''' 
 
* Press Back.  A new access point is created now.
* Now using the default browser that came with the phone or with the custom browser installed later Internet could be accessed over the GPRS.
* If the default browser is used, open it and click on Options, go to settings and select the default access point as BSNL GPRS. Modify the remaining options if needed.  
* Now this browser can be used to browse the Internet.
 
----

'''Using a phone with in built modem one can browse the Internet using their computer.''' 
 
The following steps should be followed to use a computer and connect to the Internet using the BSNL GPRS connection on the phone. The following settings are for a Windows XP computer.
 
* Connect the bluetooth dongle to a USB port of the computer and install any drivers if required. 
* Pair your phone and the PC over bluetooth. (For exact details of how to pair the PC and your phone, please refer to the user manual that came with the PC and the phone.) 
* Once pairing is over the computer would recognize the phone as a modem over bluetooth connection also and will start the services required for it over a particular COM port.  
* Now Open System Properties (Win Key + Pause/Break is the easiest way to do this). Click on Hardware tab and then on Device Manager button.  
* This will open a window where all the hardware on your PC is listed. Click the ‘+’ to expand the Modems and select the “Standard Modem over Bluetooth link #''x''”  
* Double click on it. The Properties window for this modem willopen. Click on Advanced tab. In the Extra Initialization Commands textbox fill – '''“AT+CGDCONT=1,&quot;IP&quot;,&quot;bsnlsouth&quot;”''' &lt;''without quotes''&gt;.Without this string the computer will not connect to the Internet, but it will throw a PPP Link error. Please note that the “bsnlsouth” mentioned above is the access point name in your GPRS connection settings of your phone. (or gprssouth.cellone.in)
* Click OK, close the Device Manager. * Go to Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections. Click File '''-&gt;''' New Connection. In the New Connection Wizard that comes up, follow these steps:  
 
   - Click Next  
   - Select Connect to the Internet and click Next. 
   - Select Set up my connection manually and click Next. 
   - Select Connect using a dial-up modem and click Next.  
   - Enter “BSNL GPRS” in the ISP Name text box and click Next.  
   - Enter “*99#” in the Phone Number text box and click Next.  
   - Chose the connection availability as per your discretion and click Next.  
   - Leave User name and password blank. Uncheck the check boxes if needed and click Next.  
   - Tick the check box to have a short cut on your desktop and click Finish.  
 
* Switch on the bluetooth radio of the phone. 
* Now double click on this connection’s icon and click on dial. It will dial and connect the computer to the internet!!! 
 
These procedures and settings help the BSNL subscriber to connect to the Internet over GPRS using a BSNL South India prepaid account. The above procedure works equally well for Post paid subscribers and for connection to PC/ laptop with USB cable.Specially useful for heavy users who have subscribed to BSNL post paid unlimited GPRS usage.

I used the same settings on a '''Sony Ericsson Z550i''' and it gets connected without much difficulty.

Also works with '''Samsung E-840''' using the access point 'gprssouth.cellone.in'.

Another easier way of setting up your mobile for '''BSNL GPRS''' connection is given below

1. Goto the link http://ap.bsnl.co.in/mmsgprs/Portal%20link%20documents/Manual-Device+Settings.doc

2. Click on the  Automatic GPRS/WAP/MMS Mobile Handset configuration  

3. Enter your phone number

4. You will get a sms on the mobile with a password

5. Now enter the system message on the web

6. Select the phone and model

Settings will be made automatically done on your mobile.

this works fine with GPRS south

This works with BSNL New Anant Plan in Kerala Sount with Nokia N70

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two ways to generate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subtraction_angiography Digital Subtraction Angiography] images with OsiriX (v1.7), once an XA image sequence has been stored in its database (an example sequence can be found at http://homepage.mac.com/kieranmaher/Anonymized.zip):

== 1.  Using the Subtraction module ==

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:subModInactive.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

Display the image sequence in the 2D Viewer and activate the subtraction module (use Format | Customize Toolbar... if this module is not displayed in the toolbar of the 2D Viewer).

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=0 cellspacing=8 cellpadding=2
| [[Image:maskImage.jpg]]
| [[Image:liveImageB.jpg]]
|- 
| &lt;center&gt;Mask Image (1)&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;Live Image (9)&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The image number used for the mask image is displayed – the first image of the sequence is the default mask.  Browse through the sequence and adjust the WL/WW as needed.  Click on the ‘current’ button to select another mask image.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=0 cellspacing=8 cellpadding=2
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:subModMask1.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:subModMask9.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:maskMinusLive.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:liveMinusMask.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| &lt;center&gt;(1) - (9)&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;(9) - (1)&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Use the up/down arrows to shift the relative position of the mask and live images in single pixel increments in both horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) dimensions, if needed.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:pixelShift.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

Note than finer shifts than whole pixels are a feature yet to be implemented in OsiriX.

Use the Thick Slab module, in the MinIP mode to (effectively) integrate a number of live images so as to generate a vascular trace.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=0 cellspacing=8 cellpadding=2
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:thickSlabMod.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| &lt;center&gt;[[Image:vascTrace.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;
|- 
| &lt;center&gt;(1) - (5+6+7+.....+15)&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Notes:

Pixel values displayed for subtracted images refer (incorrectly) to unsubtracted images – presumably because the subtracted image is generated in display memory only.

A plug-in is available from http://homepage.mac.com/kieranmaher/LogTransformplugin.zip (for purists) to take the Log Transform of an image sequence prior to running the subtraction process.

== 2. Using the Fusion module ==

Open an image sequence in the 2D Viewer, and open the same sequence for a second time, so that the image sequence is displayed in two separate windows.  Turn off synchronization by selecting 2D Viewer | Stack Syncronize | Off.  Drag the icon of one window and drop it onto the image in the second window to call up the fusion functions and click the Subtraction button:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:fusionMod.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

Pixel values displayed for subtracted images refer (correctly) to subtracted images with this option, although pixel shifting is not available.  The Thick Slab module can be used to (effectively) integrate both mask images (before subtraction) and live images (before and following subtraction) so as to improve image SNR and to generate a vascular trace.

Afrikaans uses the same alphabet as English. Notable differences include ''diacritics'' on the letters (like ê), while certain letters, such as c, exist but are infrequently used.

You'll soon find Afrikaans has a very ''phonetic'' (phonemic) spelling; that is, unlike in English, French or even its parent language Dutch, Afrikaans words are almost always spelled the way they sound.

This chart uses IPA - the international phonetic alphabet to show the exact Afrikaans pronunciation. You can read more about it [[wikipedia:IPA|here]]. The English words are only an approximate guide. Afrikaans pronunciation can be a bit tricky for English speakers because the language has quite a few sounds that don't exist in English. The best way to learn is to listen to native Afrikaans speakers. You can listen to streaming Afrikaans radio [http://www.rsg.co.za/ here] and hear Afrikaans sound recordings at [http://www.openlanguages.net/afrikaans/ this site].

:*Background information to the [[Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine]] wikibook:

::I was introduced to this subject in 1972 by Jim Malone, PhD while studying at the [[w:Dublin Institute of Technology|College of Technology, Kevin St]], Dublin, Ireland.  I was doing the third year of a diploma course in applied physics. Some years later I was lecturing in the same course and adapted Jim's notes for my lectures.  I was also working at this time as a physicist in nuclear medicine at the nearby [http://indigo.ie/~arhc/arhchx.html Meath Hospital].  I further adapted the notes for lectures within a physics degree course at Kevin Street. And later still for a medical radiations degree course at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMIT RMIT], Melbourne, Australia.  As such the notes benefitted considerably on the basis of questions from students as well as comments from clinical and academic colleagues.  By 1997 I was using the notes on a visiting professorship at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_University Kuwait University].  Whilst there I was inspired out of boredom to formalise the notes into a textbook.  I subsequently developed the book into a set of webpages which lay dormant on a cd-rom for five years or more. Until mid-2006, when I uploaded them to wikibooks.....

:*Background information to the [[Basic Physics of Digital Radiography]] wikibook:

::I started giving lectures in this subject area whilst working in Melbourne in the late 1980s, although I'd been doing research using digital radiography for some years previously, and these lectures still continue to this day (2013) at the [http://www.unimelb.edu.au University of Melbourne].  The concept for the wikibook arose out of this experience as an attempt to reformulate and modernise topic presentation.  The material draws heavily from Heggie JCP, Liddell NA &amp; Maher KP, 2001, 4th Edition and from discussions with colleagues at [http://www.svhm.org.au St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne].  The wikibook could be extended to include mammography and MDCT physics in the future.

I'm interested in learning about the WikiBooks phenomenon by engaging with it and exploring its potential for the continuous evolution of instructional resources.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dashes''' (&quot;—&quot;, &quot;–&quot;) are used to mark an interruption within a sentence, while '''hyphens''' (&quot;-&quot;) are used to join two parts of a compound word, or to indicate that a word has been split at the end of a line. A dash is approximately as long as two hyphens.

==Dash==
Dashes are minus-shaped characters used to mark an interruption within a sentence.  They are used in much the same way as parentheses.

There are two kinds of dashes: ''em dashes'' looking like &quot;—&quot;, and shorter ''en dashes'' looking like &quot;–&quot;. It is usual to either use em dashes without spacing, or en dashes with spacing, but not em dashes with spacing, as shown in the following two examples:
: Example: Three unlikely companions—a canary, an eagle, and a parrot—flew by my window in an odd flock.
: Example: Three unlikely companions – a canary, an eagle, and a parrot – flew by my window in an odd flock.

In most word processors, there is a keystroke combination that will produce an em-dash:
* Windows: em-dash: Alt-0151.
* Windows: en-dash: Alt-0150.
* Mac: em-dash: shift-option-dash.

==Hyphen==
A hyphen joins two parts of a compound word. 
: Example: governor-elect, twenty-five, half-baked.  
Hyphens can also be used to make compound words more understandable.  Consider these words:
* Man-eating dog
* Man eating dog

The first example describes a particular type of dog (man-eating). The second example, alas, suggests that a man is eating a dog.

Or consider the case of the flaming-red pickup truck, as opposed to its more alarming cousin, the flaming red pickup truck.

In general, if the first of two adjectives is describing the second, and not the noun following, you should use a hyphen: deep-blue water, good-tasting hamburger, happy-faced child.

==Width Difference==
The em dash is roughly as wide as two hyphens. In the days of typewriters, it was actually written as two hyphens. An en dash is shorter than em dash while wider than a hyphen.

Drug use is a threat to physical and mental health. Many of the drugs discussed here are addictive and being caught using or selling them often carries severe criminal penalties. 

==Drug==
[[File:Psychoactive Drugs.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A collection of psychoactive drugs.]]
So what exactly is a &quot;drug&quot;? 

A drug is any substance - natural or artificial - that changes the normal functioning of the body. This can vary between minor drugs that relieve common illness and symptoms, to drugs that block all sensory input to the brain.

So what separates your typical cough medicine from powerful deliriants? You may be surprised to know that it could be nothing! Several over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are just as powerful as even the most dangerous drugs if taken in the wrong dosages. 

For example, several OTC pain relievers contain [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Codeine|codeine]], which is an opiate. It is usually synthesized from [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Morphine|morphine]], as is [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Heroin|heroin]]. Common cough and cold relief medications contain [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/DXM|Dextromethorphan hydrobromide]], more commonly known as DXM. At recommended doses it reduces the cough reflex. At higher does it is an extremely powerful psychoactive. 

[[Wikipedia:Acetaminophen|Acetaminophen]], on the other hand, is one of the most widely used medications for pain and fever relief. Also known as Paracetamol and APAP, it is sold under the brand names Tylenol and Anacin . It's commonly mixed with DXM and [[/Codeine|Codeine]] in several OTC medications. Even acetaminophen, which is frequently seen as harmless by the public can be very dangerous in high doses.  Similarly, some preparations of DXM, such as [[Wikipedia:Coricidin|Coricidin Cold and Cough]], contain [[Wikipedia:chlorphenamine maleate|chlorphenamine maleate]], an [[Wikipedia:antihistamine|antihistamine]], which is deadly in high doses. Abuse of the cough syrup Coricidin have lead to overdose and death.  No drug, including OTC medicines, should be take beyond the recommended dosages without first consulting a physician.

These examples show how even abuse of common or &quot;every day&quot; drugs which many people believe to be harmless can cause serious damage. There is no &quot;safe&quot; drug, just because it is legal and sold without a prescription doesn't mean it can be taken at any dosage safely.

== Don't ==

Drugs such as those touched on in this book may be readily available and, in some social settings, accepted or encouraged.There is always the option to say no.  Many drugs are highly addictive and because of this, experimenting ''frequently'' leads to addiction. Drug use ''is'' generally considered dangerous and in many cases leads to death or severe harm. 

The safest way to not shoot yourself in the head, is to neither load the gun nor pull the trigger. The safest way to avoid bad repercussions from drug use is to not to use drugs. 

One always has a choice.

==Uncontrolled==
Many illicit drugs are illegal, and as such there are no government regulations controlling purity.  Drugs purchased on the black market (or &quot;the steet&quot;) may be mixed (or &quot;cut&quot;) with other substances to increase profits. These substances themselves can often be deadly.  Therefore, it is not possible to know what you are taking when you illegally purchase drugs.  Often people feel comfortable with &quot;their dealer&quot; and trust them to sell &quot;clean&quot; drugs.  Unfortunately a dealer's source can and often does change.  The large number of hands that an illegal substance may pass though make it impossible to know precisely what is being sold.

== What to do when things get out of hand ==
Here are some steps that can be taken if you or someone else has taken drugs and you feel that things have &quot;gotten out of hand&quot;.  You can:
* Contact your local poison control center.
* Go the nearest hospital emergency room.
* Get an ambulance.

In any of the above cases it is very important to tell the medical profession ''exactly what you are taking''.  People are often injured more seriously by not being upfront with their doctors because they wish to avoid other consequences. 

If possible take a sample of what you were using with you to the hospital. Also make sure they know what quantity and what method you used to ingest the substance. 

Before you use any drugs, always think of the consequences to yourself, your family and friends and society. Why should society pay for your emergency treatments in hospital?

==Why do people use drugs?==

Most people use drugs simply for the enjoyment of the high. Because of this they open themselves to falling victim to addiction.

==Drug Classifications==
All psychoactive drugs fall into three classes: [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Hallucinogens|Hallucinogens]], [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Stimulants|Stimulants]], or [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Depressants|Depressants]]. Some drugs fall into only one class, while others fall into a combination of classes. There is a debated fourth class of drugs called Anti-Psychotics. 

'''Entheogen''' is a fairly modern term, referring to a psychoactive substance used for religious purposes. Substances that fall under this category: [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Marijuana|cannabis]], tobacco, psilocybin mushrooms, [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Salvia|salvia divinorum]], ayahuasca, and many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An idiom is a sort of template or generic method of expressing an
idea.  In the same way that idioms in a human language make life
easier for the both speaker and listener good idioms in computer
programming make life easier for the programmer.  Naturally what is
idiomatic in one language might not be in another.

It is not necessary that there exist a physical template, an idiom can
exist in your head and be so familiar that when faced with a problem
that can be solved by application of an idiom you begin to type the
code almost without noticing what you are doing.

Another word often used for ideas like this is ''pattern''.  However
the word ''pattern'' has become so formalised and so strongly
associated with object orientation that I feel the more generic word
idiom is better also it is the word generally associated with the
first major example that I will show.

An idiom can be language specific, library specific, domain specific,
or any combination of the three.  For instance if you are writing a
program that deals with lists of things you might borrow some of the
list processing idioms of Lisp even though Visual Basic Classic has no
native list processing functions at all.  By creating functions that
manipulate lists rather than inlining the code to do it you will make
your code more meaningful to someone reading it.

It is a commonplace that programmers feel ever so slightly godlike
because they are in total control of their programs.  I think that
programmers would be better off emulating Shakespeare instead: when
the English language of his day wasn't up to saying what he wanted he
had no hesitation in extending both its stylistic range and its
vocabulary.

==Resource Acquisition Is Initialization - RAII==

The name of this idiom makes it sound like a very complicated idea but in fact it is very simple and fits Visual Basic Classic very well.  This idiom is a solution to problems such as setting and clearing busy flags, controlling access to files, setting the mouse icon and so on.

The basic idea is to use the constructor of an object to obtain or query a lock on some resource and to use the destructor to release that lock.  In a language like Visual Basic which has deterministic finalization this produces very succinct code. 

Let's take the mouse as an example.  

===Example: Mouse Busy Icon===

It is very common in Windows programs to set the mouse icon to indicate that the program is busy and the the user must wait.  A problem arises when you have lots of different pieces of code that can take a long time and lots of different code paths that invoke them.  If the caller doesn't know that the process will be time consuming it won't know that the icon must be changed so we put code in the long running routine to change the mouse pointer.  This works fine until we try to combine two or more such routines: which one gets to cancel the busy icon?

One common solution is to regard the mouse as a resource and control access to it with a pair of routines that maintain a count.  One routine increments the count when the routine sets the busy icon and the other decrements and clears the icon when the count goes to zero.  This works well until an exception occurs, then a routine might exit early and the routine that decrements the counter won't be called.  Of course you could put another call in the error handler but that causes extra maintenance.

A better solution is to make use of the automatic termination events built in to Visual Basic.  The basic idea is still to use a count but instead of guarding the count with a routine you guard it with an object.

Each procedure that wants to indicate that it is time consuming by showing the mouse busy icon should wrap its code in a with statement that creates a cMouseBusy instance by calling NewMouseBusy.  When the routine finishes the cMouseBusy instance will be disposed of automatically, its Terminate event handler will be executed and the reference count will be reduced by one.

Because the program might have many forms open we must take account of the form when we set the busy icon because the MousePointer property belongs to a form not the application

So that we know which form's mouse pointer to change we must keep a separate count for each different client

====Exercises====
*Compile the example code and check that it works.  
*Extend the code to allow for more than one type of busy icon.  For instance an icon with a pointer that indicates that the user interface is still live and one without a pointer that indicates that the user must wait.
*Create a test program to demonstrate the new features.

====Code====

Just add this line as the first line of every function that should show the busy cursor:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;Dim oMousebusy As cMouseBusy: Set oMousebusy = NewMouseBusy(Client)&lt;/source&gt;
  
or enclose the busy section in:

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  with NewMouseBusy(Client)
    ...
  End With
&lt;/source&gt;

''Client'' is anything that has a mouseicon property

=====cMouseBusy=====
Objects of this class acquire the mouse busy status when created by a constructor called ''NewMouseBusy''.  They release it when they are terminated.  

The busy status is simply a counter that is incremented each time a new cMouseBusy object is created and decremented when such an object is destroyed.  If the counter increments to one then the mouse busy icon is set on the client object, when the counter decrements to zero the normal icon is set.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  VERSION 1.0 CLASS
  BEGIN
    MultiUse = -1  'True
    Persistable = 0  'NotPersistable
    DataBindingBehavior = 0  'vbNone
    DataSourceBehavior  = 0  'vbNone
    MTSTransactionMode  = 0  'NotAnMTSObject
  END
  Attribute VB_Name = &quot;cMouseBusy&quot;
  Attribute VB_GlobalNameSpace = False
  Attribute VB_Creatable = True
  Attribute VB_PredeclaredId = False
  Attribute VB_Exposed = False
 
  Option Explicit
  
  Private moClient As Object  
  
  Friend Sub Initialize(ByRef roClient As Object)
    Set moClient = roClient
    If IncrefCount(roClient) = 1 Then
      roClient.MousePointer = vbHourglass
    End If
  End Sub
   
  Private Sub Class_Terminate()
    If DecRefCount(moClient) = 0 Then
      moClient.MousePointer = vbDefault
    End If
  End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

=====modMouseBusy.bas=====
This module provide the constructor for cMouseBusy.  This gives us the ability to pass arguments to the object when it is created.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Attribute VB_Name = &quot;modMouseBusy&quot;
  
  Option Explicit
  
  Private moReferenceCount As Dictionary
  
  Public Function NewMouseBusy(ByRef roClient As Object) As cMouseBusy
    If moReferenceCount is Nothing then
      Set moReferenceCount = New Dictionary
    End If
    Set NewMouseBusy = New cMouseBusy
    NewMouseBusy.Initialize roClient
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember that Visual Basic is single threaded and that the User Interface will not update until all code stops executing unless you call DoEvents so do this to make sure that the change to the mouse icon is visible.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
    DoEvents
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

This function increments the count for the given object and returns the new count.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Function IncrefCount(ByRef roClient As Object) As Long
    Dim lRefCount As Long
    IncrefCount = 1 + moReferenceCount(roClient)
    moReferenceCount(roClient) = IncrefCount
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

This function decrements the count and returns the new count.  Note that if the count goes to zero then the entry is removed from the list; this must be done because the ''keys'' are objects and they will not terminate if we do not release the reference.

&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
  Public Function DecRefCount(ByRef roClient As Object) As Long
    DecRefCount = moReferenceCount(roClient) - 1
    If DecRefCount = 0 Then
      moReferenceCount.Remove roClient
    Else
      moReferenceCount(roClient) = DecRefCount
    End If
  End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello World.

I am interested in the future of textbooks.

I believe that the evolution of them follows this path:

Textbooks created by individual experts --&gt;(archaic and current situation)

Textbooks created by teams of experts --&gt;(current situation)

Textbooks created by teams of amateurs --&gt;(current situation)

Textbooks created by students --&gt;(incipient situation)</text>

'''Programs under the 2002 Farm Bill'''

USDA Rural Development - [http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rd/newsroom/2002/weplist02.html/ water and wastewater disposal projects] funded

===National Rural Development Partnership===
Georgia has no State Rural Development Council under this USDA program.[http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/nrdp/state/statemap.html]


==U.S. Environmental Protection Agency==

===Drinking Water State Revolving Fund===
&quot;The DWSRF was established by the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Amendments to provide (low or no-interest) loans to publicly and privately owned public water systems for infrastructure improvements needed to protect public health and ensure compliance with the SDWA.  As of June 30, 2002, the DWSRF had provided 2,500 loans for $5.1 billion to water systems for eligible projects.&quot; [http://www.epa.gov/owm/water-efficiency/wef_final.pdf]
Eligible projects include:
*enhancing water system management and performance
*preventing contamination problems
*source water protection
*water efficiency activities and programs

===Clean Water State Revolving Fund===
The CWSRF program was established under the U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1987 to provide loans for point source (§212), nonpoint source (§319), and estuary (§320) projects.  As of June 30, 2002, the CWSRF program had privided 12,500 loans for $42.4 billion for water quality protection projects. The CWSRF funds approximately $3 to $4 billion in water quality projects each year. Water efficiency and reuse activities and projects may be considered point sources if they are developed as a component of a (publicly owned) wastewater treatment works (§212 project).&quot; [http://www.epa.gov/owm/water-efficiency/wef_final.pdf]

===Restoration Credits===
Under the U.S. Clean Water Act provisions for wetlands protection (section 404), owners of proposed projects which will cause unavoidable wetlands damage must provide for mitigation of that damage as a condition for receiving a 404b permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  One mitigation method is for the project owner to restore sufficient ecological function to compensate for the unavoidable damage to be caused by his proposed project.  Or the project owner may buy &quot;ecological credits&quot; from someone else who has already restored ecological function, such as by removing an existing dam, as described in news article about removal of the Lowell Dam on Little River in North Carolina.[http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/383318.html]

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Angelos. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Angelos~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

I have created the following 2 templates for use in this book: 

*[[Template:DSP Page]]
*[[Template:DSP Stub]]
*[[:Category:Digital Signal Processing]]
*[[:Category:DSP Stubs]]

--{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:56, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

== Follow-Up Books ==

I have already started outlines for 2 books that will be logical follow-ups to this book:

*[[User:Whiteknight/Digital Media Processing]]
*[[User:Whiteknight/VLSI System Design]]

Questions and comments about these outlines are welcome and encouraged. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:52, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

== RFC: Making examples matlab/octave compatible ==

It looks like the examples in this wikibook thus far are done using a proprietary syntax, ie. &quot;X[n] = [ 4 5 6&amp; 7 8 9 ]&quot;.  What I'd like to propose is replacing these samples with expressions that will run correctly in Octave/Matlab, using the LCD common syntax of these two tools.

On one hand, this is somewhat restrictive, in the sense that all vectors must be enumerated by strictly positive integers.  On the other hand, I think it will increase the utility of this book to enable the student to &quot;follow along&quot; in matlab or octave.

Thoughts?

:DSP mathematical theory requires the use of data sets with negative positions, so we can't use pure matlab syntax. Also, DSP texts use a very similar syntax to the one i've used so far, except the &quot;&amp;&quot; symbol is usually replaced by an arrow, a dot, or an underscore (depending on the text). I think that we need to keep things as close to an accepted textbook standard notation as possible I do plan on adding Matlab/Octave sample code and examples in most chapters though, so we can work on creating and adding them. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:11, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

I understand there is not much here right now. I am currently trying to outline this book and am gathering research. It may seem slow at times but i promise more will come. If anyone wants to add to this that would be greatly appreciated.

Chapter 2.  [[Georgia Water/Policy|Water Policy]]
:2.3. [[Georgia Water/Laws|Georgia Water Law]] __FORCETOC__

===Summary of the Act===
&quot;This legislation created the Coastal Marshlands Protection Committee which grants, denies, revokes, and amends all permits provided for by the Act and details the process to handle grievances of a party in relation to any rules or regulations adopted by the Board of Natural Resources. 
The Act outlines the powers and duties of the DNR and the Board of Natural Resources as to coastal marshlands.&lt;br/&gt;
Marshlands may not be filled, drained, dredged, or otherwise altered without a permit from the committee. The Act indicates the process for obtaining a permit and explains the points reviewed by the committee prior to issuing or denying a permit. It authorizes the inspection of marshlands by officers and conservation rangers of the DNR to verify compliance with the rules, regulations, and permits, and enforcement in the case of noncompliance.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf]

Chapter 2.  [[Georgia Water/Policy|Water Policy]]
:2.3. [[Georgia Water/Laws|Georgia Water Law]] __FORCETOC__

===Summary of the Act===
&quot;This Georgia law provides significant property tax reductions to qualified landowners who conserve
environmentally sensitive lands for ten years. Environmentally sensitive areas include habitats with
endangered species, wetlands, floodplains, stream corridors, undeveloped barrier islands, steep slopes and wildlife habitat larger than ten acres.

This program can build landowner awareness of and appreciation for conservation needs and incentives, which in turn can lead to a commitment to more permanent land conservation (e.g., a conservation easement in perpetuity). Unfortunately, rules promulgated under this law make it difficult for landowners to have their lands designated and assessed as “environmentally sensitive lands”. The rules should be modified to make it easier for landowners to take advantage of the tax incentives afforded to those who are willing to protect such lands for ten years.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf]

Chapter 2.  [[Georgia Water/Policy|Water Policy]]
:2.3. [[Georgia Water/Laws|Georgia Water Law]] __FORCETOC__

===Summary of the Act===
&quot;The Georgia Environmental Policy Act (GEPA) requires that all State agencies and activities prepare an Environmental Impact Report as part of the decision-making process for all activities that may have an impact on the environment.  Alternatives to the proposed project or activity must be considered as part of the report. &lt;br/&gt;
The Act states that any proposed governmental action which may “significantly adversely
affect the quality of the environment”, including the state’s air, water, land, plants, and animals, requires an Environmental Effects Report. As outlined in the Act, an Environmental Effects Report describes the environmental impact and any adverse environmental effects of the action, alternative actions, mitigation measures proposed to avoid or minimize impact, and other effects of the action. &lt;br/&gt;
The government agency responsible for the action authors the report and provides it to the director of the Environmental Protection Division (EPD) in the DNR. A notice that the report has been prepared is to be published in the legal organ of each county in which the action is to take place, which may lead to a public hearing regarding the action. The Act requires the director of the EPD to issue guidelines to assist government agencies in the preparation of environmental effects reports.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf]

==What is Hardware and Software?==

At the highest level, a computer system is composed of hardware and software components. Hardware consists of all the physical devices. All the programs (code) that run on the computer system form the software part. The hardware and software are tightly coupled and they complement each other. Hardware is useless without software and software requires hardware to carry out computations.

==Different Types of Software==

===System Software===

System software is anything that is an essential part of the computer system; or in other words a software is the artificial intelligence which dictate the rules of operation within its systems.

====Operating system software====

An operating system is the low-level software that acts as an interface between the user and the hardware. The OS provides a &quot;virtual machine&quot; where the user is safe to execute their applications and program code.

[[Image:os_stack.png]]

Common operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux derivatives.

====Utility programs====

Utility software helps manage and tune the computer hardware, OS or application software. It usually performs a single task or small range of tasks. Good examples include:

*'''Archive''': utilities take a file or collection of files and output a single file or stream.
*'''Disk defragmenters''': reorganise file structure so that all file fragments are contiguous on the disk. Modern filesystems, such as those used by Mac OS X and GNU/Linux, do not need explicit defragmenting.
*'''Encryption''': utilities use a specific algorithm to encrypt/decrypt the contents of a file or stream using an encryption key.
*'''Virus scanners''': scan for malicious computer program code in files and storage devices.

====Library programs====

A collection of subprograms used to develop software and hardware compatibilities. Libraries contain &quot;helper&quot; code and data for other programs to use in a modular way; they are usually not executable and exist purely to provide services to other programs.

====Compilers, assemblers and interpreters====

A '''compiler''' is a computer program that '''translates code''' written in a high level language to a lower level language, e.g. assembly language or machine language. The most common reason for translating source code is to create an executable program (converting from a high level language into machine language).

''Advantages of using a compiler''
* Source code cannot be stolen/copied
* Tends to be faster than interpreting source code
* Produces an executable file, and therefore the program can be run without need of the source code
''Disadvantages of using a compiler''
* Object code needs to be produced before a final executable file
* The source code must be 100% correct for the executable file to be produced

An '''assembler''' translates assembly language into machine language. Assembly language consists of mnemonics for machine opcodes so assemblers perform a ''1:1 translation'' from mnemonic to a direct instruction. Conversely, one instruction in a high level language will translate to one or more instructions at machine level.

''Advantages of using an assembler''
* Assembly code is often very efficient (and therefore fast) because it is a low level language
* It is fairly easy to understand due to the use of English-like mnemonics
''Disadvantages of using an assembler''
* Lots of assembly code is needed to do relatively simple tasks, and complex programs require lots of programming time
* Assembly tends to be optimised for the hardware it's designed for, meaning it is often incompatible with different hardware

An '''interpreter''' program executes other programs directly, running through program code and executing it ''line-by-line''. This is slower than running compiled code but it can take less time to interpret program code than to compile in then run it &amp;mdash; this is very useful when prototyping and testing code.

''Advantages of using an interpreter''
* Useful for prototyping software and testing basic program logic
* Easy to find errors in source code because the translation will stop when an error is encountered
''Disadvantages of using an interpreter''
* Source code is required for the program to be executed
* Interpreters are generally slower than compiled programs due to the per-line translation method

===Application Software===

Application software is designed for the user to allow them to solve a task.  These may include Word processors, spreadsheets and database packages.  (NOTE: do not use brand names in the exam, unless asked to, it is better to use the type of software instead, e.g. &lt;s&gt;Excel&lt;/s&gt; Spreadsheet package)

====General purpose====

General purpose application software is designed to solve a wide range of tasks, for example:

*Word processor
*Spreadsheet package
*Presentation package

====Special purpose====

Special purpose application software performs a specific task or set of tasks, for example:

*Media player
*Accounting
*Vector drawing

====Bespoke====

Bespoke application software has been written specifically for the needs of a user or company. It is &quot;tailored&quot; to their exact requirements. Some examples might be:

*Air traffic control
*Factory robot
*Tourist kiosk
*etc.

==Introduction to how computers store data==

Computers can't understand colours, words and sounds like humans. Even if you use digital cameras and voice recognition, a computer has to translate these inputs into the only language it does understand, that is the language of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;. This is called &lt;b&gt;binary&lt;/b&gt;.

Binary is different from our own decimal numbering system. Instead of having 10 different values like decimals: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 (this can also be referred to as denary or base 10), binary (or base 2) only has 2 values: &lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. A &lt;b&gt;bi&lt;/b&gt;nary digi&lt;b&gt;t&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;bit&lt;/b&gt; as it is more commonly known, can either be set to 0 (off) or 1 (on).

By combining many bits together, we create what are known as &quot;bit patterns&quot;. Inside the computer, all data is transmitted and manipulated in bit patterns. Apart from individual bits, the two other most important bit patterns are:

*'''Byte''': This is a quantity of bits that computers tend to use as the smallest sequence of bits to store data, e.g. 10110110. This is &lt;b&gt;eight bits wide&lt;/b&gt; on most types of computer, but can vary on more obscure machines.
*'''Word''': This is sometimes called a 'manipulation unit'. It is a set length of bits that varies between types of computers, but is usually 32 or 64 bits long in most modern computers.

*'''Program''': A program is a set of instructions that are processed by the computer to do a specific operation. This could be anything, from adding two numbers and outputting the result, to the complex instructions in the program of a computer game.
*'''Data''': Data (the singular is datum) are raw numbers that have no meaning by themselves. Data could be stored about parts of a video clip, an image, a sound, text or a number.

==What parts make up a computer?==

These components are found in virtually every computer:

*'''Processor''': The 'brain' of the computer. It executes instructions sequentially and processes data. The processor is usually divided up into the '''Arithmetic and Logic Unit''' ('''ALU'''), and the '''Control Unit'''. The ALU carries out logical evaluations (for example comparisons), and mathematical expressions (such as addition and subtraction). The Control Unit carries out the functions that organise instructions and co-ordinates all the data and instructions, similar to traffic lights controlling the flow of cars. The processor is also called a '''Central Processing Unit''' ('''CPU''').
*'''Clock''': A piece of hardware used to keep the processor (and some other integrated circuits) in time by generating an oscillating signal with a steady frequency.
*'''Main Memory''': This is temporary storage that stores data currently being worked on. It is accessible to the processor directly, without going through any input/output channels. It does, however, need to connect to the processor via the data, address, and control buses. When power is lost, all data stored in main memory is lost, therefore meaning it is '''volatile'''. Main memory is also known as '''Immediate Access Storage''' ('''IAS''').
*'''Address Bus''': A collection of wires between the processor and main memory used to communicate the physical location (address) of data in main memory.
*'''Data Bus''': A collection of wires between the processor and all internal devices, and is used to send and receive both data and instructions.
*'''Control Bus''': A collection of wires between the processor and devices used to send commands and get status signals from the devices. For example, it could show whether the computer was reading or writing to memory.
*'''I/O Port''': An interface and physical connector that allows peripherals, such as a keyboard, mouse or monitor, to communicate with the 'heart' of the computer system &amp;mdash; the processor and main memory. I/O stands for '''Input/Output'''.
*'''Secondary Storage''': This is computer memory that is not directly accessible to the processor but uses the I/O channels. It is for storing data not in active use and preserves data even without power, meaning it is '''non-volatile'''.

&lt;b&gt;diagram is needed here&lt;/b&gt;

==How to run programs==

All programs are stored as a series of bit patterns ready to be executed (or &quot;run&quot;) by the processor. All modern computer systems use the &quot;stored program concept&quot;. This is where program instructions are loaded into main memory for the '''fetch and execute cycle'''.

The stored program concept basically states that both instructions and data to be operated on can be loaded into memory at the same time, as opposed to having the instructions pre-programmed into the hardware, and then passing this hardware the data to be processed.

The fetch-execute cycle is the retrieval of data and instructions from main memory through the data bus, and then executing the data or instructions using the processor.

An example of these ideas working together would be when a computer system was required to add two numbers together. A program that adds numbers is loaded into main memory. Then each instruction of the program is fetched and executed one after the other by the processor, along with any data required (in this case the numbers to be added). The processor stores the current instruction in a special register and uses its Arithmetic and Logic Unit to process the instruction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What country did they live in?==
[[Image:Celts in Europe.png|This map shows areas once inhabited by ancient Celts (light green), the areas that remain Celtic-speaking today (dark green), and the boundaries of the six commonly-recognized 'Celtic nations' (intermediate green).|right|thumb|200px]]
In around 400 BC, the Celts ranged from [[Wikijunior:Europe/United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Ireland|Ireland]] all the way across Europe to northern Turkey.  Today, Celtic descendants live in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall and Northern Ireland in the [[Wikijunior:Europe/United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], Brittany in [[Wikijunior:Europe/France|France]], the Isle of Man and the [[Wikijunior:Europe/Ireland|Republic of Ireland]].  Other Celtic people live in countries where their ancestors moved to.

==What did they look like?==
Men wore a loose fitting tunic down to the knees and trousers called Bracae. Women wore long, loose fitting dresses. They made their clothes from linen woven from the flax that Celtic farmers grew. They were very concerned about their appearance and used dye from berries to colour their clothes. Both men and women also wore great cloaks when travelling, women used a decorative brooch to fasten their cloak at the neck. These cloaks were very heavy and often used as sleeping bags for the men when they were away hunting. The Celts used lime to bleach their hair, preferring light hair and both men and women wore their hair long.

==What did their buildings look like?==
Most Iron Age Celts in Britain lived in '''roundhouses'''; circular houses of wood or stone with thatched straw roofs shaped like a cone. Most roundhouses were made up of wooden posts, with the walls made out of &quot;'''''wattle and daub.'''''&quot; Wattle and daub consists of wooden sticks (wattles), covered with a mixed mud and clay plaster (daub). 

In Scotland most roundhouses were built of stone rather than wood, yet retained the cone-shaped thatched roof. This type of roundhouse is called the '''Atlantic roundhouse.'''

Celtic houses in mainland Europe were rectangular.

The Celts in Ireland built many forts and settlements, the most popular design was the ringfort. Inside a ringfort wooden, circular houses were built using wattle and daub.

Celts also built fortified defensive structures, which can still be seen today, especially in the highlands and isles of Scotland, as well as Ireland.

==What did they eat?==
Celts ate like most other Europeans, subsisting mostly on grains supplemented by meats, fruits, and vegetables. Exactly what they ate varied by area, and Celts grew local crops. Scottish highlanders were famous for supposedly subsisting almost entirely on '''oats''', though this was not entirely true. However, oats remain the favorite grain of Scotland, and Scottish cuisine is full of them. '''Potatoes''' serve this role in Ireland, although they were not introduced until after Columbus reached the New World.

The Celts in Ireland farmed the land and reared cattle and sheep. In the spring, they would get milk, butter and cheese from the cattle, killing them later in the year for meat. Cattle were not only a means of food for Celts, the Celts wealth was measured in the amount of cattle they owned. One ancient Irish tale tells of Queen Maedhb (May-ev) and another rival king, and their battle over the Táin Bó Chuaille (a bull). This doesn't just show the importance of cattle in Celtic society, but also the fact that they thoroughly accepted the idea of women as leaders, unlike other societies of that time.

The most famous example of food of any Celtic people is probably the Scottish '''haggis'''. Many people aren't quite clear on what a haggis is, and one survey conducted in the United States found that over half of the people they surveyed thought that the haggis was a small rodent native to Scotland.  In reality, a haggis usually consists of a sheep's 'pluck' (heart, liver, windpipe and lungs), minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, which is traditionally boiled in the animal's stomach for about an hour.

==What did they wear?==
[[Image:Torque gaulois en bronze.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A bronze torque, a neckband worn by Gauls.]][[Image:Gaul_warrior_Mondragon_2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Relief statue of a Gaulish woman. She wears loose robes, an armband (probably bronze), and carries a sword.]] Celts took a great interest in their clothes when they could afford to do so. Many more modern Celts had colourful designs woven into their clothes called '''tartan''', still shown in Scottish Kilts and Trews today. 

Celts also had a great fondness for jewellery, and both men and women wore quite a bit, when they could afford it.

Finally, many warrior Celts wore their weapons (swords, more often than not) as normal attire. This became very complex during the late Middle Ages with Scottish highlanders, who were sometimes seen with a broadsword at their waist, dirk (long knife) on their belt, one or more pistols also attached to their belt, a long hunting rifle, and a small dagger in their sock, called a Sgian Dubh (Gaelic for ''&quot;Black Dagger&quot;'').

==What did their writing look like?==
Celts didn't have a very high opinion of the written word. Instead, they recorded their history and culture in an '''oral tradition;''' that is, they recorded their past by telling stories. Early examples of Gaelic Celtic writing have been recovered in Europe, based on the Phoenician alphabet.

In Ireland, a different alphabet was used, primarily in Gaelic Celtic languages like [[Wikijunior:Languages/Irish|Irish]], [[Wikijunior:Languages/Manx Gaelic|Manx]], and Scottish Gaelic. This alphabet was called '''Ogham''', sometimes referred to as the ''&quot;Celtic Tree Alphabet.&quot;'' It developed as a way for Irish monks to write in stone.  

[[Image:Ogham airenach.png|frame|center|An example of Ogham from the Book of Ballymote.]]

After Christianity was spread throughout the Gaelic world, Ogham fell into disuse, in favor of the Latin alphabet (largely because Christian writings were all in the Latin alphabet).

==What did they believe?==
Celts were '''polytheists;''' they believed in many gods and goddesses (deities). Unlike many other civilisations, different groups of Celts worshipped various deities, although there were some patterns. '''Beira''' was the name that Celts gave to Mother Earth, and some of them believed her to be the mother of all their deities. 

Most Celts believed in an afterlife, we know this because archaeologists have found many grave goods within their burial tombs (Dolmens, Cairns). Many, though not all, Celts worshipped in sacred groves.

==Are some of them famous even today?==
[[Image:Boudiccastatue.jpg|A statue of Boudicca near Westminster Pier, London|right|thumb|200px]][[Image:Robert Burns.jpg|Robert Burns|left|thumb|150px]]
Yes! Today, the British Isles (along with Ireland) are probably regarded to be Celtic more than any other area in the world. No one is quite sure who lived there before them, and they were certainly well-established by the time the Romans came there in AD 43. After 20 years of Roman rule, the chieftain of the Icenii tribe, Prasutagus, died. Though by tradition, his wife '''Boudicca''' would have assumed leadership of the tribe, the Romans took Icenii land, brutally humiliating Boudicca and her two daughters. This enraged the Icenii people, and Boudicca raised an army to fight the Romans and liberate Britain. She gained support of many other Celtic tribes, and almost succeeded in toppling the Roman Empire in Britain. She is revered as a national hero in Britain.

The world-renowned Scottish poet, Robert Burns, was a Celt.

Many famous Celts are alive today. The famous Scottish actor, Sean Connery, is proud of his Celtic heritage.

==What is left of them today?==
Celts are alive and thriving today! Much of the population of Europe are seen as descendants of the Celts, and the nations of Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany and Isle of Man are considered to be made up of primarily Celtic peoples. As well, the Celtic '''diaspora''', the descendants of Celts around the world, is vast, being spread greatly through the British Empire. In particular, Novia Scotia, Canada, is a hotbed of modern Gaelic Celtic culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is this the proper place to talk about the book? I thought this would be interesting... 
http://www.ctmu.net/  .  I think the real problem is the myth of 'seperate objectness' and the myth of 'outside' vs 'inside'.  Objects are not ultimately seperate, only distinct, i.e. reality is one surface with distinctions we perceive as 'seperate'.  So there is no &quot;outside&quot; or &quot;inside&quot;, it is continuous, with distinctions that appear discrete and disconnected.  Like bumps or waves in a unified surface.  But the are actually all connected in the ultimate sense.  That would do away with any 'problems', each piece of reality = self-excited circuit/self-detecting-self-processing-ring, and it would explain evolution as well.--Zack Bran

:Hi, I have just had a look at your paper.  I found it interesting. I think you clearly identified the regression arguments with the postulate of the universe as a 3D manifold with an independent time dimension. A few thoughts phrased as questions: 
:Can we have states without topologies and are space and time simply terms for degrees of freedom in a topology? Given that the world is at least 3+1D, are you sure that mind is not an nD state at one end of your information channels rather than the transforms/languages that relate the ends? Have you considered the duality inherent in nD projective geometry (cf Steiner)?  Have you considered manifolds of signature +++-, +++--, ++++- etc where the negative signature gives a projective geometry? Recursion is a feature of successions of 3D classical manifolds (where time is separate) but is recursion always necessary in higher dimensional manifolds with mixed signatures (in complex manifolds events can be projected and at a point)?

:: Robin join the discussion here and the main index http://www.ctmu.org/ and http://www.megafoundation.org/index2005.htm - there's a member area, and a discussion forum for members there. -- Zack
::: (Zack again) I am not the author of CTMU.   I have been working on my own ideas and I disagree with some point's of the CTMU.  Specifically that our reality is 'self-contained', in that the universe of change is the 'real' universe, i.e. that is all there is. I've been studying fractals and fractal recursion, and my current conjecture is that our universe is a fractal subdivision of a larger entity.  I have been developing my own ideas but the are far from complete, you are welcome to contact me though, if interested.  Just leave a message here, and tell me where I can leave a post in your talkback (post a link to where you want me to post so then you can just click and post).  Part of the new ideas I've been working on is partially related to the half-finished (i.e. that's my judgment) ideas of G. Spencer http://www.lawsofform.org/  there is also a discussion group here http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lawsofform/ and also http://www.boundarymath.org/

I have a problem with the characterization of the hard problem given at the beginning: ''&quot;A state is an arrangement of things in space over a period of time.&quot;'' This is implying that a ''conscious state'' is an arrangement of things in space over a period of time. That is, this ''assumes'' physicalism.

In fact, the way this page is written, it betrays a misunderstanding of the Hard Problem, and what the Hard Problem side calls &quot;consciousness.&quot;

The Dennett crowd projects that when we (Lanier, Chalmers, myself) talk about consciousness, that we are talking about something that can make decisions, and performs processing with some sort of ontology living within the mind. Soft (like a fuzzy neural network,) or delineated (like a computer,) however.

This is not actually our claim. We are saying that there is a visage, an appearance, an experience, and that it is this visage that is epiphenomenal. Unnecessary. That there is an explanatory gap ''there.''

It needs to be perfectly clear: Any functional explanation ''isn't it.'' If you say, &quot;Oh, but the brain rotates shapes ''this way,''&quot; or if you say, &quot;But associative reasoning works ''this way,''&quot; then you haven't done a thing to explain the epiphenomenal experience. You may as well be talking about the motions of cars outside of the body.

Not only &quot;''conscious experience is not required for a nineteenth century model of the behaviour of organisms''&quot;, but conscious experience is not even required for a ''20th'' or ''21st'' century model of the behavior of the organism.

The brain is just as external to the experience as the motions of cars. And the experience is just as epiphenomenal to the mechanics of the thinking in the brain, as it is epiphenomenal to the motion of the car. The car could move just perfectly fine without anybody experiencing it, and the brain could think, talk, and reason (even about consciousness) just fine, without experience.

It's entirely within bounds to say: &quot;consciousness comes from the motions of the brain.&quot; But the epiphenomalism of consciousness is still there, regardless, hangling off as an unnecessary dangler. Poke a body with a brain in it, and it should go &quot;ouch,&quot; the brain should start working out strategies for telling a person to bug off, a face should scoul, and the reputation systems held in mind should update and the chemistry and neural patterning of emotions should turn to anger, ''but'' -- there's no need for anything to actually experience it.

Dennett argued in &quot;The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies,&quot; saying (paraphrased,) &quot;Could you ''really'' believe in zombies? I find that hard to believe.&quot; But this is an argument from incredulity. The explanatory gap is still present, Dennett's incredulity does not close it.

[[User:LionKimbro|LionKimbro]]

Excellent point and a regrettable oversight in the text. I have put in a paragraph in the module pointing to your discussion as a temporary measure. That said, I do not see 'the hard problem' as Chalmers' possession, it also refers to observations by a large number of philosophers from Leibniz gazing at a brain made from cogs and wheels onwards. But the lack of mention of the impetus behind property dualism is a black hole in the current book! [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:12, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

I have extended the introduction to explain the objective of the section in more depth.  The objective of the section is to show that information about the physical state of the world is incomplete and subject to revision. That there are deep, unresolved problems in physics, especially about the nature of time, space and matter that impinge directly on the problem of consciousness. Some arguments for dualism, such as epiphenomenalism, are actually aspects of problems in science that are awaiting explanation. I am also going to add the missing section on dualism in the previous module. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 13:59, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
The Java Programming Wikibook is a shared effort in amassing a comprehensive guide of the complete Java platform &amp;mdash; from programming advice and tutorials for the desktop computer to programming on mobile phones. The information presented in this book has been conceptualised with the combined efforts of various [[Java Programming/Authors &amp; Contributors|contributors]], and anonymous editors.

The primary purpose of this book is to teach the Java programming language to an audience of beginners, but its progressive layout of tutorials increasing in complexity, it can be just as helpful for intermediate and experienced programmers. Thus, this book is meant to be used as:
* a collection of tutorials building upon one another in a progressive manner;
* a guidebook for efficient programming with the Java programming language; and,
* a comprehensive manual resource for the advanced programmer.

This book is intended to be used in conjunction with various other online resources, such as:
* the [http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/overview-summary.html Java platform API documentation];
* the [http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/index.html official Java website]; and,
* active Java communities online, such as [http://home.java.net Java.net] and [http://www.javaranch.com JavaRanch], etc.

==Who should read this book?==
Everything you would need to know to write computer programs would be explained in this book. By the time you finish reading, you will find yourself proficient enough to tackle just about anything in Java and programs written using it. This book serves as the first few stepping stones of many you would need to cross the unfriendly waters of computer programming. We have put a lot of emphasis in structuring this book in a way that lets you start programming from scratch, with Java as your preferred language of choice. This book is designed for you if any one of the following is true.

* You are relatively new to programming and have heard how easy it is to learn Java.
* You had some [[w:BASIC|BASIC]] or [[w:Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] in school, and have a grasp of basic programming and logic.
* You already know and have been introduced to programming in earlier versions of Java.
* You are an experienced developer and know how to program in other languages like [[w:C++|C++]], [[w:Visual Basic|Visual Basic]], [[w:Python (programming language)|Python]], [[w:Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], etc.
* You've heard that Java is great for web applications and web services programming.

Although this book is generally meant to be for readers who are beginning to learn programming; it can be highly beneficial for intermediate and advanced programmers who may have missed out on some vital information. After completing this book you should be able to solve many complicated problems using the Java skills presented in the following chapters. Once you finish, you are also encouraged to undertake ambitious programming projects of your own.

This book assumes that the reader has no prior knowledge of programming in Java, or for that matter, any object-oriented programming language. Practical examples and exercises following each topic and module make it easy to understand the software development methodology.  If you are a complete beginner, we suggest that you move slowly through this book and complete each exercise at your own pace.

== How to use this book ==

This book is a reference book of the Java language and its related technologies. Its goal is to give a complete picture of Java and its technologies.  While the book can be read from the beginning to end, it is also designed to have individual sections that can be read independently.  To help find information quickly, navigation boxes are given in the online version for access to individual topics.

This book is divided to sections. Pages are grouped together into section topics. To make this book expandable in the future via the addition of new sections, the sections navigation-wide are independent from each other. Each section can be considered as a mini book by itself. Pages that belong to the same topic can be navigated by the links on the right hand side.

== How can you participate ==
Content is constantly being updated and enhanced in this book as is the nature of wiki-based content. This book is therefore in a constant state of evolution. Any Wikibooks users can participate in helping this book to a better standard as both a reader, or a contributor.

[[Organic Chemistry/Dienes/Conjugation|&lt;&lt; Conjugation ]] | [[Organic Chemistry/Aromatics|Next Chapter: Aromatics ]] 
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

=== Common Reactions of Conjugated Dienes ===
Conjugated dienes have enhanced stability as compared to molecules without conjugated double bonds due to resonance.  In general, this makes them slightly less reactive than other types of alkenes in general and dienes specifically.  However, many reactions proceed through high-energy cation or radical intermediates; in these cases the resonance stabilization of the intermediate allyl species makes conjugated dienes more reactive than non-conjugated dienes or simple alkenes.

== Hydrobromination: ==
Adds a Bromine and a Hydrogen to a conjugated Diene.

'''Example''':

&lt;code&gt;Butadiene + HBr--&gt; 3-bromobutene (Low Temperature) + 1-bromobut-2-ene (High Temperature) + 1-bromobutene (Not Observed)&lt;/code&gt;

'''Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control of Reaction''':
*At low temperature the reaction is under KINETIC CONTROL: the 3-bromobutene is formed faster because it has a lower transition state free energy, as the intermediate cation is more stable at the secondary carbon. 
*At high temperature the reaction is under THERMODYNAMIC CONTROL: the 3-bromobutene still forms more quickly, but the reaction has enough energy to reverse, and the more stable product (1-bromobut-2-ene) is formed.

== Diels-Alder Reaction ==
One of the most important of all diene reactions is the Diels-Alder Reaction, in which a conjugated diene reacts with an dienophile to form a cyclohexene.


'''Requirements''':
The diene must be able to access the s-cis conformation for the reaction to take place.


'''DIENEOPHILES''' - A species which likes to attack Dienes
 
- A Dienophile must contain a double or triple bond.  Typically, an electron withdrawing group is conjugated to the dienophile to make it electron-poor (nitriles, ketones, and esters are common electron withdrawing groups).  Because the reaction is highly stereospecific, the configuration of the dieneophile will determine the relative stereochemistry of the cyclohexene product.

The Diels-Alder reaction occurs most effectively with an electron-poor dieneophile and an electron-rich diene ('normal demand'). 'Inverse demand' Diels-Alder reactions can also be carried out, in which the dienophile is electron-rich and the diene electron-poor.

==Formulae==
By the end of this module you will be expected to have learnt the following formulae:

===Projectile Motion===
* Equation of Trajectory: &lt;math&gt;y = x \tan \theta - \frac {g x^2}{2 V^2 \cos ^2 \theta} &lt;/math&gt;

===Work, Energy and Power===
* Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE): &lt;math&gt;E_p = m g h\,&lt;/math&gt;
* Kinetic Energy (KE): &lt;math&gt; E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 &lt;/math&gt;
* Work done by a force: &lt;math&gt; W = F d\cos \alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;
* Power of a moving force: &lt;math&gt; P = Fv \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Collisions===
* Newton's Experimental Law: Separation speed &lt;math&gt; = e \times &lt;/math&gt; Approach speed
* It follows that the coefficient of restitution, &lt;math&gt;e =\frac{v_2-v_1}{u_1-u_2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Centripetal motion===
*Using &lt;math&gt;F=ma\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a=r\omega^2\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;, F=m\omega^2r\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{v^2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;v=r\omega\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Installation the Easy Way ==

KDE comes in almost every version of Linux - the easiest way to install it is to select it as your desktop when you install Linux on your computer - you will normally be presented with a menu during installation where you can pick your desktop. Just pick KDE: easy! Some distros such as [[w:Kubuntu|Kubuntu]] ship with KDE out of the box.

How to install KDE after that will depend on which [[w:Linux distribution|Linux distribution]] you are using.

== KDE Packages ==
KDE is big, so it is split into several packages, which are listed below. KDE requires the three packages kdelibs, kdebase and aRts; and the rest are optional. However, you'll probably want most or all of these other packages because they contain useful applications. In fact, I recommend you install all of them.

==Installation==
If it is not included by default with your distro, your distro's package system may have KDE available in their repository. Check your distribution's documentation if in doubt.

=== Installing KDE on Debian and Ubuntu ===

KDE can be installed in [[w:Debian|Debian]] and [[w:Ubuntu (Linux distribution)|Ubuntu]] using [[w:apt-get|apt-get]]. For Ubuntu, this will change Ubuntu into [[w:Kubuntu|Kubuntu]]. Apt-get installs all the correct packages from the Internet or from your Debian CD - see the apt-get manual pages for details.
*Back up your data (not required, but suggested).
&lt;!--
* Quit your desktop. This is not always required, but this is a good idea - programs may start acting funny. You can normally quit your desktop by changing your runlevel. At the very least, close any applications which are running on the desktop.

I have NEVER heard of this happening.  It's just installing KDE, not running it.  I'll keep this here in case im wrong, but I'm not...
--&gt;
* Log in as root (super-user), or use sudo if you are in the sudoers list.
* Update your package information to the latest versions:
 apt-get update
* Debian users should install the kde [[w:metapackage|metapackage]] as well as the K Display Manager:
 apt-get install kde kdm
* Ubuntu users should install the kubuntu-desktop metapackage which includes KDE and the K Display Manager:
 apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
:Note: pay attention to any packages that are marked for removal before you continue. If you want to check, use the --dry-run option with this command.
&lt;!-- Removed: This is not an apt-get tutorial, just KDE installation --&gt;
* Now go to [[#Starting KDE|Starting KDE]]

=== Avoiding apt-get ===

* Synaptic can be used to control apt-get through a gui.  This can be easier if you plan to install more than KDE or prefer not to work with a terminal.

* It is also possible to download the .deb packages from the [http://packages.debian.org/stable/kde/kde Debian website] and install them using [[w:dpkg|dpkg]], in a method similar to the .rpm installation below. If you do this, you should make sure you have '''all''' the packages you need - including any dependencies you don't already have.  This method should only be used if you are unable to use apt-get.

== Installing KDE Using .RPM Files ==

If you use a version of Linux which uses .rpm to install programs, you can install KDM using rpm files.

* Download all the .rpm files you want, and save them into a new folder.
* Download and read the INSTALL and README files.
*Back up your data (not required, but suggested)
*Quit your desktop. This is not always required, but this is a good idea. You can normally quit your desktop by changing your runlevel.
*Log in as root (super-user).
* Use &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to enter the directory you saved the .rpm files to
* To install, use the command
 rpm -ivh *.rpm
* Now go to [[#Starting KDE|Starting KDE]]

== Installation from the Source Code ==

This type of installation is fairly tricky. You will need the correct version of Qt and some other libraries installed before you start. See the KDE website for details.

The [http://techbase.kde.org/Getting_Started/Build/Historic/Konstruct Konstruct] tool simplifies this by doing many of the tasks, such as downloading and properly extracting packages, configuring and building them.

== Starting KDE ==

If you are on a desktop or have [[w:xserver|xserver]] running already, quit it. To start KDE, type
 xinit /usr/bin/startkde
which will start kde on a new xserver. If this doesn't work, try
 startx

To start KDE each time (you probably want this) you'll need to edit your startup files. If you use KDM or XDM to log in, edit '''.xsession''', otherwise edit .xinitrc or .Xclients.
* Backup your current startup file.
* Remove the lines in the startup file which start up your previous desktop program
* Replace these with &lt;code&gt;startkde&lt;/code&gt; (if it can't find the X-Server, add &lt;code&gt;startx&lt;/code&gt; above &lt;code&gt;startkde&lt;/code&gt;).
* Restart your computer.

Guess you convinced me to. XD  I also haven't played for a while... not since I unlocked all the komas from the main game mode.  I still haven't gotten a few of the &quot;play for x number of battles&quot; ones. D:

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the Mechanics 4 module of the [[A-level Mathematics]] book. This module assumes that you are familiar with the [[../C1/]], [[../C2/]], [[../C3/]], [[../C4/]], [[../M1/]], [[../M2/]] and [[../M3/]] modules. Please post all questions to [[A-level Mathematics/Discussion]].

== Contents ==
# [[/Relative Motion]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/Centre of Mass (Second Level)/]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/Moment of Inertia/]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}

# [[/Simple Harmonic Motion (Second Level)/]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}

==Formulae==
By the end of this module you will be expected to have learnt the following formulae:

===Relative Velocity===
* &lt;math&gt;{}_P\!V_Q + {}_Q\!V_R = {}_P\!V_R&lt;/math&gt;
===Angular Motion===
For constant angular acceleration:
:* &lt;math&gt; \omega _1 = \omega _0 + \alpha t \,&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \theta = \omega _0 t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \theta = \frac{1}{2}(\omega _0 + \omega _1)t&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \omega _1^2 = \omega _0^2 + 2\alpha\theta&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt; \theta = \omega _1 t - \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2&lt;/math&gt;
* Angular momentum: &lt;math&gt; I\omega\,&lt;/math&gt;
* Kinetic energy: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2}I\omega ^2&lt;/math&gt;
* Equation of motion: &lt;math&gt; C = I \ddot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
* Work done by a constant couple: &lt;math&gt; W = C\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose of DNS==
 1. Resolve hostname into IP addresses (Forward lookup)
 2. Resolve IP address into hostname (Reverse lookup)
 3. Allow machines to be logically grouped by name 'domains'
 4. Provide email routing information

==Important Information==

 1. Domain names are separated by dots with topmost element on right.
 2. Each element could be 63 character long.
 3. The entire element could be 255 character long.
 4. letters, numbers or dashes may be used in an element.
 5. Hostname map to IP addresses in a '''many-to-many''' relationship
 6. Distributed management

==Zones and Domains==

 1. A domain is complete sub-tree of the hierarchical namespace
 2. A zone is a part of the domain managed by a particular server. 
    Subdomains are different than zones. 
    A zone may include all subdomains in a domain or may delegate authority for some subdomain as separate zones on other name servers.
    A zone represents the scope of administration for which one body is responsible

==Master/Slave  Primary/Secondary DNS/Name Servers==

 1. Master DNS server is also called Primary DNS Server
 2. Contains master copy of a data for a zone
 3. Slave DNS server is also called Secondary DNS server
 4. Slave provides backup to master server
 5. Slave maintain synchronization with his master server
 6. Both Master and Slave contain authoritative data.
 7. Slave can get its data from other slave server
 8. Ther is only one Master server per zone

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often the solution of statistical problems and/or methods involve the use of tools from numerical mathematics. An example might be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood Maximum-Likelihood estimation] of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\Theta}&lt;/math&gt;which involves the maximization of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood Likelihood function] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\Theta} = \max_\theta\,\, L(\theta | x_1, ..., x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

The maximization here requires the use of optimization routines. Other numerical methods and their application in statistics are described in this section.

'''Contents of this section:'''
* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Basic Linear Algebra and Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization|Basic Linear Algebra and Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization]] 
This section is dedicated to the ''Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization'' which occurs frequently in the solution of statistical problems. Additionally some results of algebra theory which are necessary to understand the ''Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization'' are provided. The ''Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization'' is an algorithm which generates from a set of linear dependent vectors a new set of linear independent vectors which span the same space. Computation based on linear independent vectors is simpler than computation based on linear dependent vectors.
* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Optimization|Unconstrained Optimization]] 
Numerical Optimization occurs in all kind of problem - a prominent example being the Maximum-Likelihood estimation as described above. Hence this section describes one important class of optimization algorithms, namely the so-called ''Gradient Methods''. After describing the theory and developing an intuition about the general procedure, three specific algorithms (the ''Method of Steepest Descent'', the ''Newtonian Method'', the class of ''Variable Metric Methods'') are described in more detail. Especially we provide an (graphical) evaluation of the performance of these three algorithms for specific criterion functions (the Himmelblau function and the Rosenbrock function). Furthermore we come back to Maximum-Likelihood estimation and give a concrete example how to tackle this problem with the methods developed in this section.
* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Quantile Regression|Quantile Regression]] 
In ''OLS'', one has the primary goal of determining the conditional mean of random variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, given some explanatory variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;E[Y|x_i]&lt;/math&gt;. ''Quantile Regression'' goes beyond this and enables us to pose such a question at any quantile of the conditional distribution function. It thereby focuses on the interrelationship between a dependent variable and its explanatory variables for a given quantile.
* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Numerical Comparison of Statistical Software|Numerical Comparison of Statistical Software]] 
Statistical calculations require an extra accuracy and are open to some errors such as truncation or cancellation error etc. These errors occur due to binary representation and finite precision and may cause inaccurate results. In this work we are going to discuss the accuracy of the statistical software, different tests and methods available for measuring the accuracy and the comparison of different packages.

* [[Statistics:Numerical Methods/Numerics in Excel|Numerics in Excel]] 
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of MS Excel in terms of statistical procedures and to conclude whether the MS Excel should be used for (statistical) scientific purposes or not.  The evaluation is made for MS Excel versions 97, 2000, XP and 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Basically, all the sections found here can be also found in a linear algebra book. However, the Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization is used in statistical algorithm and in the solution of statistical problems. Therefore, we briefly jump into the linear algebra theory which is necessary to understand Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization.

The following subsections also contain examples. It is very important for further understanding that the concepts presented here are not only valid for typical vectors as tuple of real numbers, but also functions that can be considered vectors.

== Fields ==

=== Definition ===

A set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; with two operations &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on its elements is called a ''field'' (or short &lt;math&gt;(R,+,*)&lt;/math&gt;), if the following conditions hold:

# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha+\beta \in R&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha+\beta = \beta+\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (commutativity)
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta,\gamma \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha+(\beta+\gamma) = (\alpha+\beta)+\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
# It exist a unique element &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, called ''zero'', such that for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha+0 = \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in R&lt;/math&gt; a unique element &lt;math&gt;-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, such that holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha+ (-\alpha) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*\beta \in R&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*\beta = \beta*\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (commutativity)
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta,\gamma \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*(\beta*\gamma) = (\alpha*\beta)*\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
# It exist a unique element &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, called ''one'', such that for all &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*1 = \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
# For all non-zero &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in R&lt;/math&gt; a unique element &lt;math&gt;\alpha^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, such that holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha * \alpha^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta,\gamma \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*(\beta+\gamma) = \alpha*\beta+\alpha*\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (distributivity)

The elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are also called ''scalars''.

=== Examples ===

It can easily be proven that real numbers with the well known addition and multiplication &lt;math&gt;(IR, +, *)&lt;/math&gt; are a field. The same holds for complex numbers with the addition and multiplication. Actually, there are not many more sets with two operations which fulfill all of these conditions. 

For statistics, only the real and complex numbers with the addition and multiplication are important.

== Vector spaces ==

=== Definition ===

A set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; with two operations &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on its elements is called a ''vector space over R'', if the following conditions hold: 

# For all &lt;math&gt;x, y\in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;x+y \in V&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;x+y = y+x&lt;/math&gt; (commutativity)
# For all &lt;math&gt;x, y, z \in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
# It exist a unique element &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{O}&lt;/math&gt;, called ''origin'', such that for all &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;x+\mathbb{O} = x&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt; exists a unique element &lt;math&gt;-v&lt;/math&gt;, such that holds &lt;math&gt;x+ (-x) = \mathbb{O}&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*x \in V&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*(\beta*x) = (\alpha*\beta)*x&lt;/math&gt; (associativity)
# For all &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 \in R&lt;/math&gt; holds &lt;math&gt;1*x = x&lt;/math&gt;
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in R&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;x, y\in V&lt;/math&gt;holds &lt;math&gt;\alpha*(x+y) = \alpha*x+\alpha*y&lt;/math&gt; (distributivity wrt. vector addition)
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in R&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt;holds &lt;math&gt;(\alpha+\beta)*x = \alpha*x+\beta*x&lt;/math&gt; (distributivity wrt. scalar addition)

Note that we used the same symbols &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; for different operations in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The elements of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are also called ''vectors''.

'''Examples:'''

# The set &lt;math&gt;IR^p&lt;/math&gt; with the real-valued vectors &lt;math&gt;(x_1,...,x_p)&lt;/math&gt; with elementwise addition &lt;math&gt;x+y=(x_1+y_1,...,x_p+y_p)&lt;/math&gt; and the elementwise multiplication &lt;math&gt;\alpha*x = (\alpha x_1,...,\alpha x_p)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space over &lt;math&gt;IR&lt;/math&gt;.
# The set of polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + ... + b_p x^p&lt;/math&gt;, with usual addition and multiplication is a vector space over &lt;math&gt;IR&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Linear combinations ===

A vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a linear combination of vectors &lt;math&gt;x_1,...x_n&lt;/math&gt;, if 

&lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i x_i&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i \in R&lt;/math&gt;. 

'''Examples:'''

* &lt;math&gt;(1,2,3)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0),\,(0,1,0), \,(0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;(1,2,3)=1*(1,0,0)+2*(0,1,0)+3*(0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1+2*x+3*x^2&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;1+x+x^2,\, x+x^2,\, x^2&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;1+2*x+3*x^2=1*(1+x+x^2)+1*(x+x^2)+1*(x^2)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Basis of a vector space ===

A set of vectors &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''basis'' of the vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, if

1.   for each vector &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt; exist scalars &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n \in R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x = \sum_i \alpha_i x_i&lt;/math&gt; 
2.   there is no subset of &lt;math&gt;\{ x_1, ..., x_n \}&lt;/math&gt; such that 1. is fulfilled.

Note, that a vector space can have several bases.

'''Examples:'''

* Each vector &lt;math&gt;(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3) \in IR^3&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1 * (1,0,0) + \alpha_2 *(0,1,0) + \alpha_3 * (0,0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore is &lt;math&gt;\{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) \}&lt;/math&gt; a basis of &lt;math&gt;IR^3&lt;/math&gt;.
* Each polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; can be written as linear combination of &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, x, x^2, ..., x^p\}&lt;/math&gt; and therefore forms a basis for this vector space.

Actually, for both examples we would have to prove condition 2., but it is clear that it holds.

=== Dimension of a vector space ===

A ''dimension'' of a vector space is the number of vectors which are necessary for a basis. A vector space has infinitely many number of basis, but the dimension is uniquely determined. Note that the vector space may have a dimension of infinity, e.g. consider the space of continuous functions.

'''Examples:'''

* The dimension of &lt;math&gt;IR^3&lt;/math&gt; is three, the dimension of &lt;math&gt;IR^p&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; . 

* The dimension of the polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;p+1&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Scalar products ===

A mapping &lt;math&gt;&lt;.,.&gt;: V\times V \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''scalar product'' if the following holds for all &lt;math&gt;x,x_1,x_2,y,y_1,y_2 \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \in R&lt;/math&gt; :

# &lt;math&gt;&lt;\alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2, y&gt; = \alpha_1 &lt;x_1,y&gt; + \alpha_2 &lt;x_2, y&gt;&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;&lt;x, \alpha_1 y_1 + \alpha_2 y_2&gt; = \alpha_1 &lt;x,y_1&gt; + \alpha_2 &lt;x, y_2&gt;&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt; = \overline{&lt;y,x&gt;}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha + \imath \beta} = \alpha - \imath \beta&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,x&gt; \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; &lt;x,x&gt;=0 \Leftrightarrow x = \mathbb{O}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Examples:'''

* The typical scalar product in &lt;math&gt;IR^p&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt; = \sum_i x_i y_i&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;&lt;f,g&gt; = \int_a^b f(x)*g(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar product on the vector space of polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Norm ===

A ''norm'' of a vector is a mapping &lt;math&gt;\|.\|: V \rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;, if holds

# &lt;math&gt;\| x \| \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\| x \| =0 \Leftrightarrow x=\mathbb{O}&lt;/math&gt; (positive definiteness)
# &lt;math&gt;\| \alpha v \|= \mid \alpha \mid \| x \|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in R&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\| x+y \| \leq \| x \| + \| y \|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,y\in V&lt;/math&gt; (triangle inequality)

'''Examples:'''

* The &lt;math&gt;L_q&lt;/math&gt; norm of a vector in &lt;math&gt;IR^p&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\|x\|_q = \sqrt[q]{\sum_{i=1}^p x_i^q}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Each scalar product generates a norm by &lt;math&gt;\|x\| = \sqrt{&lt;x,x&gt;}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \sqrt{\int_a^b f^2(x) dx}&lt;/math&gt; is a norm for the polynomials of degree &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Orthogonality ===

Two vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are ''orthogonal'' to each other if &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt;=0&lt;/math&gt;. In &lt;math&gt;IR^p&lt;/math&gt; it holds that the cosine of the angle between two vectors can expressed as

&lt;math&gt;\cos(\angle(x,y)) = \frac{&lt;x,y&gt;}{\|x\|\|y\|}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the angle between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is ninety degree (orthogonal) then the cosine is zero and it follows that &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt;=0&lt;/math&gt;.

A set of vectors &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_p&lt;/math&gt; is called ''orthonormal'', if

&lt;math&gt;&lt;x_i,x_j&gt; = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \mbox{ if } i\neq j \\ 1 &amp; \mbox{ if } i=j \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.

If we consider a basis &lt;math&gt;e_1,..., e_p&lt;/math&gt; of a vector space then we would like to have a orthonormal basis. Why ?

Since we have a basis, each vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed by &lt;math&gt;x=\alpha_1 e_1 + ... +\alpha_p e_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=\beta_1 e_1 + ... +\beta_p e_p&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the scalar product of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; reduces to

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt;\ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= &lt;\alpha_1 e_1 + ... +\alpha_p e_p, \beta_1 e_1 + ... +\beta_p e_p&gt;\ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{i=1}^p \sum_{j=1}^p \alpha_i \beta_j &lt;e_i, e_j&gt;&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; =  \sum_{i=1}^p  \alpha_i \beta_i &lt;e_i, e_i&gt; &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt; = \alpha_1 \beta_1 + ... + \alpha_p \beta_p.\ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Consequently, the computation of a scalar product is reduced to simple multiplication and addition if the coefficients are known. 
Remember that for our polynomials we would have to solve an integral!

== Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization ==

=== Algorithm ===

The aim of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is to find for a set of vectors &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_p&lt;/math&gt; an equivalent set of ''orthonormal'' vectors &lt;math&gt;o_1,...,o_p&lt;/math&gt; such that any vector which can be expressed as linear combination of &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_p&lt;/math&gt; can also be expressed as linear  combination of &lt;math&gt;o_1,...,o_p&lt;/math&gt;:

1. Set &lt;math&gt;b_1 = x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;o_1 = b_1 / \|b_1\|&lt;/math&gt;

2. For each &lt;math&gt;i&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; set &lt;math&gt;b_i = x_i - \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \frac{&lt;x_i, b_j&gt;}{&lt;b_j,b_j&gt;} b_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;o_i = b_i / \|b_i\|&lt;/math&gt;, in each step the vector &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is projected on &lt;math&gt;b_j&lt;/math&gt; and the result is subtracted from &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Vector2.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;

=== Example ===

Consider the polynomials of degree two in the interval&lt;math&gt;[-1,1]&lt;/math&gt; with the scalar product &lt;math&gt;&lt;f,g&gt; = \int_{-1}^1 f(x) g(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; and the norm &lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \sqrt{&lt;f,f&gt;}&lt;/math&gt;. We know that &lt;math&gt;f_1(x)=1, f_2(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_3(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt; are a basis for this vector space. Let us now construct an orthonormal basis:

Step 1a: &lt;math&gt;b_1(x) = f_1(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Step 1b: &lt;math&gt;o_1(x) = \frac{b_1(x)}{\|b_1(x)\|} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{&lt;b_1(x), b_1(x)&gt;}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\int_{-1}^1 1 dx}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2a: &lt;math&gt;b_2(x) = f_2(x) - \frac{&lt;f_2(x),b_1(x)&gt;}{&lt;b_1(x),b_1(x)&gt;} b_1(x) = x - \frac{\int_{-1}^1 x\ 1 dx}{2} 1 = x - \frac{0}{2} 1 = x&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2b: &lt;math&gt;o_2(x) = \frac{b_2(x)}{\|b_2(x)\|} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{&lt;b_2(x), b_2(x)&gt;}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{\int_{-1}^1 x^2 dx}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{2/3}} = x\sqrt{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3a: &lt;math&gt;b_3(x) = f_3(x) - \frac{&lt;f_3(x),b_1(x)&gt;}{&lt;b_1(x),b_1(x)&gt;} b_1(x) - \frac{&lt;f_3(x),b_2(x)&gt;}{&lt;b_2(x),b_2(x)&gt;} b_2(x) = x^2 - \frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^2 1\  dx}{2} 1 - \frac{\int_{-1}^1 x^2 x\ dx}{2/3} x = x^2 - \frac{2/3}{2} 1 - \frac{0}{2/3} x = x^2 - 1/3 &lt;/math&gt;

Step 3b: &lt;math&gt;o_3(x) = \frac{b_3(x)}{\|b_3(x)\|} = \frac{x^2-1/3}{\sqrt{&lt;b_3(x), b_3(x)&gt;}} = \frac{x^2-1/3}{\sqrt{\int_{-1}^1 (x^2-1/3)^2 dx}} = \frac{x^2-1/3}{\sqrt{\int_{-1}^1 x^4 - 2/3 x^2 + 1/9\ dx}} = \frac{x^2-1/3}{\sqrt{8/45}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{8}} (3x^2-1)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be proven that &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2}, x\sqrt{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{5}{8}} (3x^2-1)&lt;/math&gt; form a orthonormal basis with the above scalarproduct and norm.

=== Numerical instability ===

Consider the vectors &lt;math&gt;x_1 = (1,\epsilon, 0, 0), x_2 = (1,0,\epsilon,0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_3 = (1,0,0,\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is so small that computing &lt;math&gt;1+\epsilon = 1&lt;/math&gt; holds on a computer (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon). Let compute a orthonormal basis for this vectors in &lt;math&gt;IR^4&lt;/math&gt; with the standard scalar product &lt;math&gt;&lt;x,y&gt;=x_1y_1+x_2y_2+x_3y_3+x_4y_4&lt;/math&gt; and the norm &lt;math&gt;\|x\| = \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Step 1a. &lt;math&gt;b_1 = x_1 = (1,\epsilon,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 1b. &lt;math&gt;o_1 = \frac{b_1}{\|b_1\|} = \frac{b_1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon^2}} = b_1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1+\epsilon^2=1&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2a. &lt;math&gt;b_2 = x_2 - \frac{&lt;x_2,b_1&gt;}{&lt;b_1,b_1&gt;} b_1 = (1,0,\epsilon,0) - \frac{1}{1+\epsilon^2} (1,\epsilon,0,0) = (0,-\epsilon,\epsilon,0)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2b. &lt;math&gt;o_2 = \frac{b_2}{\|b_2\|} = \frac{b_2}{\sqrt{2\epsilon^2}} = (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},0)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3a. &lt;math&gt;b_3 = x_3 -  \frac{&lt;x_3,b_1&gt;}{&lt;b_1,b_1&gt;} b_1 - \frac{&lt;x_3,b_2&gt;}{&lt;b_2,b_2&gt;} b_2 = (1,0,0,\epsilon) - \frac{1}{1+\epsilon^2} (1,\epsilon,0,0) - \frac{0}{2\epsilon^2} (0,-\epsilon,\epsilon,0) = (0, -\epsilon, 0,\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3b. &lt;math&gt;o_3 = \frac{b_3}{\|b_3\|} = \frac{b_3}{\sqrt{2\epsilon^2}} = (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})&lt;/math&gt;

It obvious that for the vectors

- &lt;math&gt;o_1 = (1, \epsilon, 0, 0)\ &lt;/math&gt;

- &lt;math&gt;o_2 = (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},0)&lt;/math&gt;

- &lt;math&gt;o_3 = (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})&lt;/math&gt;

the scalarproduct &lt;math&gt;&lt;o_2,o_3&gt; = 1/2 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. All other pairs are also not zero, but they are multiplied with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; such that we get a result near zero.

=== Modified Gram-Schmidt ===

To solve the problem a modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm is used:

# Set &lt;math&gt;b_i = x_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;
# for each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; compute
##  &lt;math&gt;o_i = \frac{b_i}{\|b_i\|}&lt;/math&gt;
## for each &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;i+1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; compute &lt;math&gt;b_j = b_j - &lt;b_j, o_i&gt; o_i\ &lt;/math&gt;

The difference is that we compute first our new &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; and subtract it from all other &lt;math&gt;b_j&lt;/math&gt;. We apply the wrongly computed vector to all vectors instead of computing each &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; separately.

=== Example (recomputed) ===

Step 1. &lt;math&gt;b_1 = (1,\epsilon,0,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_2 = (1,0,\epsilon,0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_3 = (1,0,0,\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2a. &lt;math&gt;o_1 = \frac{b_1}{\|b_1\|} = \frac{b_1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon^2}} = b_1 = (1,\epsilon,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1+\epsilon^2=1&lt;/math&gt;

Step 2b. &lt;math&gt;b_2 = b_2 - &lt;b_2, o_1&gt; o_1 = (1,0,\epsilon,0) - (1,\epsilon,0,0) = (0, -\epsilon, \epsilon, 0)\ &lt;/math&gt;

Step 2c. &lt;math&gt;b_3 = b_3 - &lt;b_3, o_1&gt; o_1 = (1,0,0,\epsilon) - (1,\epsilon,0,0) = (0, -\epsilon, 0, \epsilon)\ &lt;/math&gt;

Step 3a. &lt;math&gt;o_2 = \frac{b_2}{\|b_2\|} = \frac{b_2}{\sqrt{2\epsilon^2}} =  (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 3b. &lt;math&gt;b_3 = b_3 - &lt;b_3, o_2&gt; o_2 = (0, -\epsilon, 0, \epsilon) - \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{2}}  (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, 0) = (0, -\epsilon/2, -\epsilon/2, \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;

Step 4a. &lt;math&gt;o_3 = \frac{b_3}{\|b_3\|} = \frac{b_3}{\sqrt{3/2\epsilon^2}} =  (0,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}})&lt;/math&gt;

We can easily verify that &lt;math&gt;&lt;o_2,o_3&gt; = 0&lt;/math&gt;.


== Application ==

=== Exploratory Project Pursuit ===

In the analysis of high-dimensional data we usually analyze projections of the data. The approach results from the Theorem of Cramer-Wold that states that the multidimensional distribution is fixed if we know all one-dimensional projections. Another theorem states that most (one-dimensional) projections of multivariate data are looking normal, even if the multivariate distribution of the data is highly non-normal.

Therefore in Exploratory Projection Pursuit we jugde the interestingness of a projection by comparison with a (standard) normal distribution. If we assume that the one-dimensional data &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are standard normal distributed then after the transformation &lt;math&gt;z=2\Phi^{-1}(x)-1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution then &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly distributed in the interval &lt;math&gt;[-1;1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the interesting can measured by &lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 (f(z)-1/2)^2 dx&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; a density estimated from the data. If the density &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; in the interval &lt;math&gt;[-1;1]&lt;/math&gt; then the integral becomes zero and we have found that our projected data are normally distributed. An value larger than zero indicates a deviation from the normal distribution of the projected data and hopefully an interesting distribution.

=== Expansion with orthonormal polynomials ===

Let &lt;math&gt;L_i(z)&lt;/math&gt; a set of orthonormal polynomials with the scalar product &lt;math&gt;&lt;f,g&gt;=\int_{-1}^1 f(z)g(z) dz&lt;/math&gt; and the norm &lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \sqrt{&lt;f,f&gt;}&lt;/math&gt;. What can we derive about a densities &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; in the interval &lt;math&gt;[-1;1]&lt;/math&gt; ?

If &lt;math&gt;f(z)=\sum_{i=0}^I a_i L_i(z)&lt;/math&gt; for some maximal degree &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; then it holds

&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 f(z) L_j(z) dz = \int_{-1}^1 \sum_{i=0}^I a_i L_i(z) L_j(z) dz = a_j \int_{-1}^1 L_j(z) L_j(z) dz = a_j&lt;/math&gt;

We can also write &lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 f(z) L_j(z) dz = E(L_j(z))&lt;/math&gt; or empirically we get an estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}_j = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n L_j(z_k)&lt;/math&gt;.

We describe the term &lt;math&gt;1/2 = \sum_{i=1}^I b_i L_i(z)&lt;/math&gt; and get for our integral

&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 (f(z)-1/2)^2 dz = \int_{-1}^1 \left(\sum_{i=0}^I (a_i-b_i) L_i(z)\right)^2 dz  = \sum_{i,j=0}^I \int_{-1}^1 (a_i-b_i)(a_j-b_j) L_i(z) L_j(z) dz = \sum_{i=0}^I (a_i-b_i)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

So using a orthonormal function set allows us to reduce the integral to a summation of coefficient which can be estimated from the data by plugging &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}_j&lt;/math&gt; in the formula above. The coefficients &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; can be precomputed in advance.

=== Normalized Legendre polynomials ===

The only problem left is to find the set of orthonormal polynomials &lt;math&gt;L_i(z)&lt;/math&gt; upto degree &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. We know that &lt;math&gt;1, x, x^2, ..., x^I&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for this space. We have to apply the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to find the orthonormal polynomials. This has been started in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Statistics:Numerical_Methods/Basic_Linear_Algebra_and_Gram-Schmidt_Orthogonalization#Example first example].

The resulting polynomials are called normalized Legendre polynomials. Up to a sacling factor the normalized Legendre polynomials are identical to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials Legendre polynomials]. The Legendre polynomials have a recursive expression of the form

&lt;math&gt;L_i(z) = \frac{(2i-1) L_{i-1}(z) - (i-1) L_{i-2}(z)}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

So computing our integral reduces to computing &lt;math&gt;L_0(z_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L_1(z_k)&lt;/math&gt; and using the recursive relationship to compute the &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}_j&lt;/math&gt;'s. Please note that the recursion can be numerically unstable!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Struts provides a library of [[JSP]] tags for use in constructing an application. 

== Common Features ==

All Struts tags are designed to accept common attributes, and share a common method of interacting with the environment. These attributes all refer to keyed beans stored in the page, request, session, or application objects using the &lt;code&gt;setAttribute()&lt;/code&gt; function of each. The four most common features are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Attribute
! Attribute Name
|-
| Name
| The key to find the bean under.
|-
| Scope
| The Scope attribute identifies the context to find the key in. If the scope is undefined, every available context will be searched in the order of page, request, session, and then application.
|-
| id
| The name of the scripting value that is created in the page context by this tag.
|-
| Property
| Specifies the [[Java Programming/Java Beans|Java Bean]] property to be placed in the page context. If this is not specified, the bean itself will be placed in the page context.
|}

All of these attributes, where they apply, are used in similar ways in order to simplify the interface.

=== Nested References ===

The struts tag library also provides the ability to call deeper than just what's been added to the available contexts. For instance, to access the bean b within the bean a, you would set the name attribute to &quot;a&quot; and the property attribute to &quot;b&quot;. However, if b had a property containing another bean (c) that you wished to access, the property attribute could be set to &quot;b.c&quot;. 

Additionally, indexed references can be used. If a an array of b, item two of the array could be referenced using a property value of &quot;b[2]&quot;.

In summary:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! In Struts Tags
! Expressed in java
|-
| &lt;code&gt; &lt; ... name=&quot;a&quot; property=&quot;b&quot; &gt; &lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;context.getAttribute(&quot;a&quot;).getB()&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt; &lt; ... name=&quot;a&quot; property=&quot;b.c&quot; &gt; &lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;context.getAttribute(&quot;a&quot;).getB().getC()&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt; &lt; ... name=&quot;a&quot; property=&quot;b[2]&quot; &gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;context.getAttribute(&quot;a&quot;).getB(2)&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| &lt;code&gt; &lt; ... name=&quot;puppy&quot; property=&quot;cat.rabbit[8]&quot; &gt; &lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;context.getAttribute(&quot;puppy&quot;).getCat().getRabbit(8)&lt;/code&gt;
|}

== Bean tags ==

These tags all relate to [[Java Programming/Java Beans|Java Beans]]. They are used to create and access objects that use the JavaBeans standard. Because the design of Struts is intended to decouple logic and presentation, these tags are unable to modify beans.

== Html tags ==

These tags create HTML entities. They are used to avoid the use of scriptlets for tasks like prepopulating forms or determining the targets of links.

Á== Logic tags ==

These tags are used for control flow within the document. If constructions, iteration, and page redirects are incuded in this namespace.

== Nesting tags ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975'''
O.C.G.A. 12-7-1. [http://www.gaepd.org/Files_PDF/rules/rules_exist/ocga12-7-1.pdf text] and [[Georgia Water/Policy/Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act/OCGA Sections|Code sections]]

==Summary of the Act==
&quot;This Georgia law '''regulates land-disturbing activity''', which is defined as &quot;any activity which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into state water or onto lands within the state, including, but not limited to, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, and filling of land but not including agricultural practices as described in paragraph (5) of Code Section [http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-7-17 12-7-17].&quot; &lt;br/&gt;
A number of activities are '''exempted from regulation''' under this act, including: 
*surface mining and granite quarrying (they are covered under other laws); 
*minor activities (home gardens, landscaping, etc.); 
*agricultural operations; 
*projects conducted under NRCS supervision; 
*DOT projects; and 
*public water system reservoirs. &lt;br/&gt;
Partial exemptions apply to 
*forestry land management practices, 
*activities of utility companies, 
*state road and tollway authorities, and 
*any projects involving less than one acre of disturbed area.

The Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division (EPD) is responsible for enforcing the law.  EPD may delegate duties to '''local issuing authorities'''. In order to be certified as a local issuing authority, a local government must have local ordinances for land disturbing activities, the ability to enforce such ordinances, and qualified personnel to monitor and enforce permits. 

Applicants for '''land disturbing permits''' must demonstrate that they have erosion and sedimentation control plans that meet |Best Management Practices established for the particular application.

The law also mandates stream buffer protection; for most streams, a 25 foot buffer is required, but for trout streams a 50 foot buffer must be maintained. An exemption to this buffer requirement was added to allow stream crossing for water and sewer lines, however there are specific guidelines to be followed in order to protect these streams.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf], [http://www.gaepd.org/Files_PDF/Water/buffer_implementation.pdf]

==Act Amendments in 2003==
In 2003, the Act was amended by [http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2003_04/fulltext/hb285.htm HB 285], which requires a mandatory certification program for individuals involved in land disturbing activities [http://www.sos.state.ga.us/plb/landscape/erosion_sediment_control_act.htm]
*[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-7-19 12-7-19(a).]  After December 31, 2006, all persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements
*[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-7-20 12-7-20.] Creates a Stakeholder Advisory Board to oversee the education and training program.
*[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-7-21 12-7-21(a).] Creates a study panel to recommend erosion controls and turbidity standards, by July 2006.
*[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-7-22 12-7-22.] Calls for an electronic filing and reporting system.
*[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/cgi-bin/gl_codes_detail.pl?code=12-5-23 12-5-23(5)(B).] Sets up a fee system ($80 per acre land disturbed) administered by Georgia EPD.

==Legislative history==
The completion report of the Dirt II panel includes a detailed timeline of events related to the Georgia program. [http://www.gaepd.org/Files_PDF/techguide/wpb/dirt2/tpcr_published.pdf]

==Specific provisions==


==Administration of the Act==


==Effectiveness of the Act==

:2.3. [[Georgia Water/Laws|Georgia Water Law]] __FORCETOC__
'''Game and Fish Code (O.C.G.A. 27-1-1)'''&lt;br/&gt;

===Summary of the Act===
&quot;This legislation provides the '''ownership of''', jurisdiction over, and control of all wildlife to be vested in the State of Georgia. The section declares that custody of all wildlife in the State is vested with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources for management and regulation.

The Wildlife Resources Division is the principal State agency vested with statutory authority for the protection, management and conservation of terrestrial wildlife and fresh water wildlife resources, including fish, game, nongame, and endangered species.  All licensing of recreational and commercial fish and wildlife activities, excluding shellfish, is performed by the Wildlife Resources Division.

The Coastal Resources Division issues shellfish permits, regulates marine fisheries activities including the opening and closing of the commercial shrimp harvesting season, areas of shrimp harvest, regulates marine species size and creel limits, and enforces the National Shellfish Sanitation Program.

The Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources has directed that there will be cooperation and coordination between the Divisions of the Department in the administration of their respective responsibilities.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf]

'''Georgia Coastal Management Act (O.C.G.A. 12-5-320)'''&lt;br/&gt;
===Summary of the Act===
&quot;The Coastal Management Act provides enabling authority for the State to prepare and administer a coastal management program. The Act does not establish new regulations or laws; it is designed to establish procedural requirements for the Department of Natural Resources to develop and implement a program for the sustainable development and protection of coastal resources. It establishes the Department of Natural Resources as the State agency to receive and disburse federal grant monies.  It establishes the Governor as the approving authority of the program and as the person that must submit the program to the federal government for approval under the federal Coastal Zone Management Act.  It requires other State agencies to cooperate with the Coastal Resources Division when exercising their activities within the coastal area.&quot; [http://www.gadnr.org/cwcs/PDF/Appendix_G.pdf]

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Pooop. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Pooop~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:JavaServer Pages|JavaServer Pages]] is a technology for inserting dynamic content into an [[HTML Programming|HTML]] or [[XML]] page using a Java servlet container. In other word, instead of sending HTML pages to web clients that are always the same for every one, you can send HTML pages that can be different for each client and each time they receive it (using database data for instance). To explain it, let's have a simple HTML page on a web server. The data flow is simple. To put it simply, the client requests a HTML page by sending the page URL and the server returns the given HTML page:

Here are the HTML file and the display on the client:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; vertical-align:top;&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;| The HTML page
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;| The display
|-
|&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;The current time&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
|&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;The current time&lt;/span&gt;
|}

The returned page is always the same. Now we want to display the current time. To do so, we add a servlet container to the web server. The HTML page will no longer exist on the server. When the page will be requested by a client, a Java class will generate the HTML page and the HTML page will be sent to the client. This Java class is called a ''servlet'':

Now the page is dynamic but the servlet is hard to code and to read. So we will use a ''JavaServer Page'' (JSP). A JSP is written like a HTML page. It has the file extension &lt;code&gt;.jsp&lt;/code&gt; for HTML page and the file extension &lt;code&gt;.jspx&lt;/code&gt; for an XML markup page. In addition to the HTML syntax, it has embedded ''scriptlets'' and ''jsp tags''. A scriptlet is a portion of Java code. The servlet container generates a servlet from the JSP and the servlet will be used to generate HTML pages or XML content. The HTML markups will remains as it is. The embedded scriptlets are inserted into the code of the servlet. The jsp tags are transformed into Java code. So let's use a JSP:

{|cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto; padding-top:0px; padding-bottom:0px; padding-left:2px; padding-right:2px; spacing-top:0px; spacing-bottom:0px; spacing-left:2px; spacing-right:2px;&quot;

Actually, the servlet is generated by the JSP only for the first request call. The same servlet is reused after then. It is generated again when the JSP will change. Now we have a JSP, that generates a servlet, that generates a HTML page, that will be displayed to the client:

== Scripting elements ==
There are'' three'' basic kinds of scripting elements that allow java code to be inserted directly into the JSP.
* A '''''declaration''''' tag places a variable definition inside the body of the java servlet class. Static data members may be defined as well. Also inner classes can be defined here.
 &lt;%! int serverInstanceVariable = 1; %&gt;
Declaration tags also allow methods to be defined.
 &lt;%!
    /**
     * Converts the Object into a string or if
     * the Object is null, it returns the empty string.
     */
    public String toStringOrBlank(Object obj) {
        if (obj != null) {
            return obj.toString();
        }
        return &quot;&quot;;
    }
 %&gt;
* A '''''scriptlet''''' tag places all of the statements contained within it, inside the &lt;code&gt;_jspService()&lt;/code&gt; method of the java servlet class.
 &lt;% int localStackBasedVariable = 1;
 out.println(localStackBasedVariable); %&gt;
* An '''''expression''''' tag places an expression to be evaluated inside the java servlet class. Expressions should not be terminated with a semi-colon.
 &lt;%= &quot;expanded inline data &quot; + 1 %&gt;
* A '''''comment''''' tag does nothing. It is ignored. It lets you document the file. It is different from a HTML comment as a HTML comment (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) will appear in the generated HTML file.
 &lt;%-- This is my first JSP. --%&gt;

== Directives ==
JSP directives are added at the top of a JSP page. These directives control how the JSP compiler generates the servlet. The following directives are available:

; include : The include directive informs the JSP compiler to include a complete file into the current file. It is as if the contents of the included file were pasted directly into the original file. This functionality is similar to the one provided by the C preprocessor. Included files generally have the extension &quot;jspf&quot; (for JSP '''Fragment'''):
 &lt;%@ include file=&quot;somefile.jspf&quot; %&gt; &lt;!-- Leave this include extension as 'jspf' to match the JSP fragment convention --&gt;

; page : The page directive has several attributes:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; || Results in a Java &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; statement being inserted into the resulting file.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;contentType&lt;/code&gt; || Specifies the content that is generated. This should be used if HTML is not used or if the character set is not the default character set.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;errorPage&lt;/code&gt; || Indicates the address of the page that should be shown if an exception occurs while processing the HTTP request.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;isErrorPage&lt;/code&gt; || If set to true, it indicates that this is the error page. Default value is ''false''.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;isThreadSafe&lt;/code&gt; || True if the resulting servlet must be thread safe.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;autoFlush&lt;/code&gt; || To autoflush the contents. A value of true, the default, indicates that the buffer should be flushed when it is full. A value of false, rarely used, indicates that an exception should be thrown when the buffer overflows. A value of false is illegal when also using buffer=&quot;none&quot;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;session&lt;/code&gt; || To maintain session. A value of true (the default) indicates that the predefined variable session (of type &lt;code&gt;HttpSession&lt;/code&gt;) should be bound to the existing session if one exists, otherwise a new session should be created and bound to it. A value of false indicates that no sessions will be used, and attempts to access the variable session will result in errors at the time the JSP page is translated into a servlet.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;buffer&lt;/code&gt; || To set Buffer Size. The default is 8k and it is advisable that you increase it.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;isELIgnored&lt;/code&gt; || Defines whether [[#Expression Language|Expression Language]] (EL) expressions are ignored when the JSP is translated.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;language&lt;/code&gt; || Defines the scripting language used in scriptlets, expressions and declarations. Right now, the only possible value is &quot;java&quot;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;extends&lt;/code&gt; || Defines the superclass of the class this JSP will become. Don't use this unless you &lt;u&gt;really&lt;/u&gt; know what you're doing &amp;mdash; it overrides the class hierarchy provided by the Container.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; || Defines a String that gets put into the translated page, just so that you can get it using the generated servlet's inherited &lt;code&gt;getServletInfo()&lt;/code&gt; method.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;pageEncoding&lt;/code&gt; || Defines the character encoding for the JSP. The default is &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot; (unless the contentType attribute already defines a character encoding, or the page uses XML document syntax).

 &lt;%@ page buffer=&quot;20kb&quot; %&gt; &lt;%-- example for setting Buffer Size --%&gt;
: '''Note:''' Only the &quot;import&quot; page directive can be used multiple times in the same JSP.
; taglib : The taglib directive indicates that a [[#JSP tag libraries|JSP tag library]] is to be used. The directive requires a prefix (much like a namespace in C++) and the URI for the tag library description.
 &lt;%@ taglib prefix=&quot;myprefix&quot; uri=&quot;taglib/mytag.tld&quot; %&gt;

Regardless of whether the JSP compiler generates Java source code for a servlet or emits the byte code directly, it is helpful to understand how the JSP compiler transforms the page into a Java servlet. For example, consider the following input JSP and its resulting generated Java Servlet.

{| style=&quot;width: 100%; vertical-align:top;&quot;
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;| Input JSP
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;| Resulting servlet
|-
|&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;%@ page errorPage=&quot;myerror.jsp&quot; %&gt;
&lt;%@ page import=&quot;com.foo.bar&quot; %&gt;
 
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;%! int serverInstanceVariable = 1;%&gt;
 
  &lt;% int localStackBasedVariable = 1; %&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
      &lt;%-- This will be ignored. --%&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;%= toStringOrBlank( &quot;expanded inline data &quot; + 1 ) %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Implicit objects ==
We have seen that we can declare objects in a scriplet that we can use further. There are also already declared objects that can be used by the programmer. They are called ''implicit object'':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; || The [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/jsp/JspWriter.html JspWriter] used to write the data to the response stream.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; || The servlet itself.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;pageContext&lt;/code&gt; || A [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/jsp/PageContext.html PageContext] instance that contains data associated with the whole page. A given HTML page may be passed among multiple JSPs.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt; || The [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html HttpServletRequest] object that provides HTTP request information.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;response&lt;/code&gt; || The [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html HttpServletResponse] object that can be used to send data back to the client.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;session&lt;/code&gt; || The [http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html HttpSession] object that can be used to track information about a user from one request to another.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; || Provides servlet configuration data.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;application&lt;/code&gt; || Data shared by all JSPs and servlets in the application.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;exception&lt;/code&gt; || Exceptions not caught by application code.
|}

== JSP actions ==
JSP actions are XML tags that invoke built-in web server functionality. They are executed at runtime. Some are standard and some are custom (which are developed by Java developers). The following are the standard ones.

==== jsp:include ====
Like the include directive, this tag includes a specified jsp into the returned HTML page but it works differently. The Java servlet temporarily hands the request and response off to the specified JavaServer Page. Control will then return to the current JSP, once the other JSP has finished. Using this, JSP code will be shared between multiple other JSPs, rather than duplicated.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;jsp:include page=&quot;mycommon.jsp&quot; &gt;
      &lt;jsp:param name=&quot;extraparam&quot; value=&quot;myvalue&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/jsp:include&gt;
    name:&lt;%=request.getParameter(&quot;extraparam&quot;)%&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== jsp:param ====
Can be used inside a &lt;code&gt;jsp:include&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jsp:forward&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;jsp:params&lt;/code&gt; block. Specifies a parameter that will be added to the request's current parameters.

==== jsp:forward ====
Used to hand off the request and response to another JSP or servlet. Control will never return to the current JSP.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;jsp:forward page=&quot;subpage.jsp&quot; &gt;
  &lt;jsp:param name=&quot;forwardedFrom&quot; value=&quot;this.jsp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/jsp:forward&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
In this forwarding example, the request is forwarded to &lt;code&gt;subpage.jsp&lt;/code&gt;.

==== jsp:plugin ====
Older versions of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer used different tags to embed an applet. This action generates the browser specific tag needed to include an applet. The plugin example illustrates an HTML uniform way of embedding applets in a web page. Before the advent of the &lt;code&gt;&lt;OBJECT&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, there was no common way of embedding applets.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;jsp:plugin type=applet height=&quot;100%&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
   archive=&quot;myjarfile.jar, myotherjar.jar&quot;
   codebase=&quot;/applets&quot;
   code=&quot;com.foo.MyApplet&quot; &gt;
   &lt;jsp:params&gt;
     &lt;jsp:param name=&quot;enableDebug&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/jsp:params&gt;
   &lt;jsp:fallback&gt;
     Your browser does not support applets.
   &lt;/jsp:fallback&gt;
&lt;/jsp:plugin&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Currently, the &lt;code&gt;jsp:plugin&lt;/code&gt; tag does not allow for dynamically called applets. For example, &lt;code&gt;jsp:params&lt;/code&gt; cannot be used with a charting applet that requires the data points to be passed in as parameters unless the number of data points is constant. You cannot, for example, loop through a ResultSet to create the &lt;code&gt;jsp:param&lt;/code&gt; tags. Each &lt;code&gt;jsp:param&lt;/code&gt; tag must be hand-coded.

==== jsp:fallback ====
The content to show if the browser does not support applets.

==== jsp:getProperty ====
Gets a property from the specified JavaBean.

== JSP tag libraries ==
In addition to the pre-defined JSP actions, developers may add their own custom ''actions'' using the JSP Tag Extension API. Developers write a Java class that implements one of the Tag interfaces and provide a tag library XML description file that specifies the tags and the java classes that implement the tags.

Consider the following JSP.

 &lt;%@ taglib uri=&quot;mytaglib.tld&quot; prefix=&quot;myprefix&quot; %&gt;
 …
 &lt;myprefix:myaction&gt; &lt;%-- The start tag --%&gt;
 …
 &lt;/myprefix:myaction&gt; &lt;%-- The end tag --%&gt;
 …

The JSP compiler will load the mytaglib.tld XML file:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;xml&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;6, 7&quot;&gt;
&lt;taglib&gt;
  &lt;tlib-version&gt;1.0&lt;/tlib-version&gt;
  &lt;jsp-version&gt;2.0&lt;/jsp-version&gt;
  &lt;short-name&gt;My taglib&lt;/short-name&gt;
  &lt;tag&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;myaction&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;tag-class&gt;org.wikibooks.en.MyActionTag&lt;/tag-class&gt;
    &lt;body-content&gt;empty&lt;/body-content&gt;
  &lt;/tag&gt;
&lt;/taglib&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The JSP compiler will see that the tag &lt;code&gt;myaction&lt;/code&gt; is implemented by the java class &lt;code&gt;MyActionTag&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;8, 11&quot;&gt;
public class MyActionTag extends TagSupport {
   public MyActionTag() { … }

     // Releases all instance variables.
   public void release() { … }

   // Called for the start tag
   public int doStartTag() { … }

   // Called at the end tag
   public int doEndTag() { … }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
The first time the tag is used in the file, it will create an instance of &lt;code&gt;MyActionTag&lt;/code&gt;. Then (and each additional time that the tag is used), it will invoke the method &lt;code&gt;doStartTag()&lt;/code&gt; when it encounters the starting tag. It looks at the result of the start tag, and determines how to process the body of the tag. The body is the text between the start tag and the end tag. The &lt;code&gt;doStartTag()&lt;/code&gt; method may return one of the following:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;SKIP_BODY&lt;/code&gt; || The body between the tag is not processed.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE&lt;/code&gt; || Evaluate the body of the tag.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;EVAL_BODY_TAG&lt;/code&gt; || Evaluate the body of the tag and push the result onto stream (stored in the body content property of the tag).
|}

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Todo|Add Body Tag description.}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
'''Note:''' If tag extends the &lt;code&gt;BodyTagSupport&lt;/code&gt; class, the method &lt;code&gt;doAfterBody()&lt;/code&gt; will be called when the body has been processed just prior to calling the &lt;code&gt;doEndTag()&lt;/code&gt;. This method is used to implement looping constructs.

When it encounters the end tag, it invokes the &lt;code&gt;doEndTag()&lt;/code&gt; method. The method may return one of two values:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;EVAL_PAGE&lt;/code&gt; || This indicates that the rest of the JSP file should be processed.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;SKIP_PAGE&lt;/code&gt; || This indicates that no further processing should be done. Control leaves the JSP page. This is what is used for the forwarding action.
|}

If you want to iterate the body a few times, your java class (tag handler) must implement the &lt;code&gt;IterationTag&lt;/code&gt; interface. It returns &lt;code&gt;EVAL_BODY_AGAIN&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; which means to invoke the body again.

=== JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) ===
The JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) is a component of the Java EE Web application development platform. It extends the JSP specification by adding a tag library of JSP tags for common tasks, such as XML data processing, conditional execution, loops and internationalization.

=== Struts Tag Library ===
The [[Java Programming/Struts|Struts]] project includes the [[Java Programming/Struts/Struts Tag Library|Struts Tag Library]], the bulk of which is useful independently of the Struts architecture.

== Internationalization ==
Internationalization in JSP is accomplished the same way as in a normal Java application, that is by using resource bundles.

== Expression Language ==
The Expression Language (EL) is a faster/easier way to display parameter values. It is available since JSP 2.0 . For instance, it allows developers to create Velocity-style templates:
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot; lines=&quot;LINES&quot;&gt;
Hello, ${param.visitor}
&lt;/source&gt;
Same as
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot; lines=&quot;LINES&quot;&gt;
Hello, &lt;%=request.getParameter(&quot;visitor&quot;)%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

It also offers a clearer way to navigate nested beans. Consider some beans:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
class Person {
   String name;
   // Person nests an organization bean.
   Organization organization;

   public String getName() { return this.name; }
   public Organization getOrganization() { return this.organization; }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;java&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
class Organization {
   String name;
   public String getName() { return this.name; }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Then, if an instance of Person was to be placed onto a request attribute under the name &quot;person&quot;, the JSP would have:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
 Hello, ${person.name}, of company ${person.organization.name}
&lt;/source&gt;

Same as.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
 Hello,
&lt;% Person p = (Person) request.getAttribute(&quot;person&quot;);
   if (p != null) {
       out.print(p.getName());
   }
%&gt;, of company
&lt;% if ((p != null) &amp;&amp; (p.getOrganization() != null)) {
       out.print(p.getOrganization().getName());
   }
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== JSP Technology in the Java EE 5 Platform ==
The focus of Java EE 5 has been ease of development by making use of Java language annotations that were introduced by J2SE 5.0. JSP 2.1 supports this goal by defining annotations for dependency injection on JSP tag handlers and context listeners.

Another key concern of the Java EE 5 specification has been the alignment of its webtier technologies, namely JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaServer Faces (JSF), and JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL).

The outcome of this alignment effort has been the Unified Expression Language (EL), which integrates the expression languages defined by JSP 2.0 and JSF 1.1.

The main key additions to the Unified EL that came out of the alignment work have been: A pluggable API for resolving variable references into Java objects and for resolving the properties applied to these Java objects, Support for deferred expressions, which may be evaluated by a tag handler when needed, unlike their regular expression counterparts, which get evaluated immediately when a page is executed and rendered, and Support for lvalue expression, which appear on the left hand side of an assignment operation. When used as an lvalue, an EL expression represents a reference to a data structure, for example: a [[Java Programming/JavaBeans|JavaBeans]] property, that is assigned some user input. The Unified EL is defined in its own specification document, which is delivered along with the JSP 2.1 specification.

Thanks to the Unified EL, JSTL tags, such as the JSTL iteration tags, can be used with JSF components in an intuitive way.

JSP 2.1 leverages the Servlet 2.5 specification for its web semantics.

=== Model-view-controller paradigm ===
[[File:JSP Model 2.svg|thumb|300px|The JSP Model 2 architecture.]]
A model-view-controller pattern can be used with the JSP files in order to split the presentation from request processing and computer data storage. Either regular servlets or separate JSP files are used to process the request. After the request processing has finished, control is passed to a JSP used only for creating the output. There are several platforms based on Model-view-controller pattern for web tiers (such as Barracuda, Apache Struts, Stripes, and the Spring MVC framework).

=== Environment ===
Both the Java Server (J2EE specification) and the page scripts and/or extended customised programming added operate by (in the runtime context of being loaded programs used) a special pre-installed base program called a Virtual Machine that integrates with the host Operating System, this type being the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Because either, ''both a Compiler-JVM set (called an SDK or JDK)'' or ''the lone JVM (called a JRE, Java Runtime Environment)'' is made for most computer platform OSs and the compiled programs for the JVM are compiled into special Java Byte code files for the JVM the Byte-code files (compiled Java program .class files) can be effectively transferred between platforms with no requirement to be recompiled excepting versioning compatibility, or special circumstance. The source code for these J2EE servlet or J2EE JSP programs is ''almost always supplied with J2EE JSP material and J2EE Web Applications because the server must call the compiler when loading them''. These small extension programs (custom tags, servlets, beans, page scripting) are variable and likely to be updated or changed either shortly before runtime or intermittently but particularly when sending JSP page requests themselves, ''  &lt;u&gt;it requires the JSP server to have access&lt;/u&gt; to a Java compiler (SDK or JDK) and the required source code (not simply the JVM JRE and byte code class files)'' to successfully exploit the method of serving.

JSP syntax has two basic forms, ''scriptlet'' and ''markup'' though fundamentally the page is either HTML or XML markup. Scriptlet tagging (called Scriptlet Elements)'' (delimited) blocks of code'' with the markup are not effectively markup and allows any java server relevant API (e.g. the servers running binaries themselves or database connections API or java mail API) or more specialist JSP API language code to be embedded in an HTML or XML page provided the correct declarations in the JSP file and file extension of the page are used. Scriptlet blocks do not require to be completed in the block itself only the last line of the block itself being completed ''syntactically correctly as a statement'' is required, it ''can be completed in a later block''. This system of split inline coding sections is called ''step over scripting'' because it can wrap around the static markup ''by stepping over it''. At runtime (during a client request) the code is compiled and evaluated, but compilation of the code generally only occurs when a change to the code of the file occurs. The JSP syntax adds additional XML-like tags, called JSP actions, to be used to invoke built-in functionality. Additionally, the technology allows for the creation of JSP tag libraries that act as extensions to the standard HTML or XML tags. JVM operated Tag libraries provide a platform independent way of extending the capabilities of a Web server. Note that not all company makes of Java servers are J2EE specification compliant.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;A Glossary of Terms Related to Basic Ecology&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----

'''Biological control or biocontrol:''' 1. In general, the control of the numbers of one organism as a result of natural predation by another or others.  Specifically, the human use of natural predators for the control of pests or weeds.  Also applied to the introduction of large numbers of sterilized males of the pest species, whose matings result in the laying of infertile eggs (Allaby, 1998).  2. The release of one species to control another (Carlton, 2001).  3.  The management of weeds using introduced herbivores (often insects) as biological control agents (Booth et al., 2003). 4. Control method involving a biological control agent that is a natural enemy of a target pest (Heutte and Bella, 2003).

'''Biological diversity or biodiversity:''' Used to describe species richness, ecosystem complexity, and genetic variation (Allaby 1998). 

'''Bioregion:''' A biological subdivision of the earth’s surface delineated by the flora and fauna of the region (Allaby 1998).

'''Biota:'''  The plants and animals of a specific region or period, or the total aggregation of organisms in the biosphere (Allaby 1998).
 
'''Community:''' Any grouping of populations of different organisms that live together in a particular environment (Allaby 1998). 

'''Disturbance:''' An event or change in the environment that alters the composition and successional status of a biological community and may deflect succession onto a new trajectory, such as a forest fire or hurricane, glaciation, agriculture, and urbanization (Art 1993). 

'''Ecosystem:'''  A discrete unit, or community of organisms and their physical environment (living and non-living parts), that interact to form a stable system (Allaby 1998). 

'''Endemic:''' A species or taxonomic group that is restricted to a particular geographic areas because of such factors as isolation or response to soil or climatic conditions; this species is said to be endemic to the place (Allaby 1998) and would be native. 

'''Exotic species:''' This term is commonly used in publications and literature, and is similar to the terms alien species, foreign species, introduced species, non indigenous species, and non native species (Heutte and Bella 2003).  Other definitions include: 1. An introduced, non native species, or a species that is the result of direct or indirect, deliberate or accidental introduction of the species by humans, and for which introduction permitted the species to cross a natural barrier to dispersal (Noss and Cooperrider 1994).  2.  In North America, often refers to those species not present in a bioregion before the entry of Europeans in the 16th century, or present in later parts of that region and later introduced to an ecosystem by human-mediated mechanisms (Cohen and Carlton 1988).  

'''Fauna:''' The animal life of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998)

'''Fitness:''' Survival and reproduction ability of an individual 

'''Flora:''' Plant or bacterial life forms of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). 

'''Habitat:''' 1. The place, including physical and biotic conditions, where a plant or an animal usually occurs (Allaby 1998). 2. The physical conditions that surround a species, or species population, or assemblage of species, or community (Clements and Shelford, 1939).  

'''Indigenous:''' A species that occurs naturally in an area; a synonym for native species (Allaby 1998), although see &quot;endemic&quot;.

'''Native range:''' The ecosystem that a species inhabits (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Native species:'''  1. A synonym for indigenous species 2. A species that occurs naturally in an area, and has not been introduced by humans either intentionally or unintentionally (Allaby 2005).  3.  In North America, a species established before the year 500 (Jeschke and Strayer 2005)

'''Naturalized species:''' 1. A species that was originally introduced from a different country, a different bioregion, or a different geographical area, but now behaves like a native species in that it maintains itself without further human intervention and now grows and reproduces in native communities (Allaby 1998).  2. A non native species that forms self-sustaining populations but is not necessarily an invasive species (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Niche:''' the role the species plays in the functioning of the ecosystem: the &quot;functional status of an organism in its community&quot; (Charles Elton, in Odum, 1959).

'''Population:''' A group of potentially inter-breeding individuals of the same species found in the same place at the same time (Booth et al. 2003).

'''Ruderal species:''' A plant associated with human dwellings, construction, or agriculture, that usually colonizes disturbed or waste ground.  Ruderals are often weeds which have high demands for nutrients and are intolerant of competition.  See also native weed or invasive native (Allaby 1998).  

'''Species: ''' A group of organisms formally recognized as distinct from other groups; the taxon rank in the hierarchy of biological classification below that of genus; the basic unit of biological classification, usually defined by the reproductive isolation of the group from all other groups of organisms (Allaby 1998). 

'''Weed:'''  1. A plant in the wrong place, being one that occurs opportunistically on land or in water that has been disturbed by human activities (see also ''ruderal species'' and ''native weed'' or ''invasive native''), or on cultivated land, where it competes for nutrients, water, sunlight, or other resources with cultivated plants such as food crops.  Under different circumstances the weed plant itself may be cultivated for beneficial purposes (Allaby, 1998).  2. A native or introduced species that has a perceived negative ecological or economic effect on agricultural or natural ecosystems (Booth et al., 2003).  3.  A plant growing in an area where it is not wanted (Royer and Dickinson, 1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objectives and Risks ==

The Elephant and Horse Attack (commonly known as the “EH Attack” or “E+H Attack”) is a very popular system and is seen much more frequently than the [[Arimaa/Elephant_and_Camel_Attacks |Elephant and Camel Attack]] due to the high risks involved with the latter.  The important distinction is that the attacker’s Camel remains safe during an Elephant and Horse Attack and can be used to counterbalance the defender’s Camel.  In the Elephant and Camel Attack, by contrast, the defender’s Camel becomes quite powerful if the attacking Camel is taken hostage and the cost for abandoning the hostage is more severe for the attacker.  The Elephant and Horse Attack is currently very effective against the best computer programs but there is not yet a consensus in the Arimaa community as to whether the E+H Attack is the best system to use against a strong human defender.

'''''Note: For simplicity, many examples below will assume that the Gold player is attacking the c6 trap.  Naturally, the same theories can apply equally to attacks on all 4 traps.'''''

Reasons to use the Elephant and Horse Attack:

* to trap enemy pieces when the enemy Elephant is too far away, or unable, to defend the trap
* to create a wall with two strong pieces so that a Rabbit may be advanced along the outside
* to distract the enemy Elephant from the opposite wing
* to encourage a Horse hostage in order to decentralize the enemy Elephant
* to encourage a Horse hostage in order to attempt an [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Blockade |Elephant blockade]]
* to encourage a Horse hostage with the intention of [[Arimaa/Multi-Piece_Swarming_Attacks |swarming]] the trap with small pieces and releasing the attacking Elephant

Summary of risks (assuming Gold attacks the c6 trap):
* the Horse may be taken hostage
* the Horse may be framed – this is a major disadvantage if the attacking Elephant is pinned to the c5, b6 or c7 square
* the opposing player may be able to begin an attack on the trap just vacated by the Horse and/or Elephant

== Ideal Placement of Pieces ==

The attacker should employ the Elephant and Horse attack against a trap that does not have a defending Camel.  It is often disastrous if the Horse is taken hostage by the Camel and the attacking Elephant becomes decentralized during a rescue operation.  

When attacking an enemy trap, a very effective plan is to place the Horse on b6 and the Elephant on d6.  The advantages are:
* if the enemy Elephant cannot reach c5, it is usually difficult for the defender to place a piece on c5, making it problematic to defend the trap – even if a defender can reach c5 it may still be in danger of being pushed towards the c3 trap
* if the Horse is taken hostage it will be safe from the f6 trap
* if the Horse is framed, the Elephant is ideally placed on d6 – it can be quite disadvantageous for the attacker if the Gold Elephant is pinned to c5, b6 or c7
* the Horse cannot become forked on the d6 square while the Elephant is standing there!
* the Horse is located as far as possible from the enemy Elephant and Camel while still maintaining a convenient escape route along the ‘a’ or ‘b’ file – this becomes especially important if the Gold Elephant ever moves away from the c6 trap
* the Horse can effectively assist an advancing Rabbit on the ‘a’ file
* if the Gold Horse occupies b6, then the Silver Horse is denied its ideal defensive square 
* the defensive position becomes highly cramped

If there is a Silver Rabbit on d8, it is usually a good idea to pull it to d7 with the Elephant:
* it will become an obstacle for a Silver Camel that is located behind the f6 trap
* the Rabbit may be captured after Gold controls the c6 trap
* a Silver defender is removed from the back rank for the benefit of any advanced Gold Rabbits

The attacking Horse can also occupy the c7 square rather than the b6 square in order to capture an enemy piece on c8, just as a Camel often does during an Elephant and Camel Attack.  However, this is sometimes dangerous for the attacking Horse and some players prefer to simply leave the Horse at b6.  The major problem is that during an Elephant and Horse Attack on c6, the enemy Camel often lurks at a nearby square, such as f7.  And that Camel would love nothing more than to hold the Horse hostage behind the c6 trap in order to either paralyze the Elephant, or lure it behind the trap.  Before the Gold Horse is moved to c7, it is prudent to ensure that the Silver Elephant cannot create any threats that will distract the Gold Elephant from the c6 trap.

If the defender has many pieces near the trap, it may be necessary to advance a third attacker in order to quickly seize control of the trap.  If possible, the third attacker should be a Dog, or weaker, so that the other Horse and the Camel can be used defensively.

== Defensive Systems and Counter-Attacks ==

There are a few simple and effective prophylactic measures that the defender can use to prevent or delay the Elephant and Horse Attack.  By placing defending Horses on the outside of both traps (on the ‘b’ and ‘g’ files), the enemy will need to devote some extra moves to first pull the Horse away from the square, then occupy it with the attacking Horse.  The defending Elephant will usually arrive on the scene long before the attacker can accomplish his/her objectives.  A second possibility is to guard the trap with both a Camel and a Horse – of course, the opposing player may simply attack the other trap in that case!  A third preventative measure commonly used is to threaten an Elephant and Horse Attack on the same wing.  For example, if Horses are defending traps at b3 and b6 and then Gold Elephant moves to the b5 square, the Silver Elephant can simply move to the b4 square and neither player will successfully carry out the Elephant and Horse Attack – not yet.

If the prophylactic measures fail, and the opposing player does carry out an Elephant and Horse Attack there are several defensive options:
* occupy the c5 square with the Elephant in order to neutralize the attack
* take the Horse hostage with the Elephant – current Arimaa theory considers this to be a dubious decision
* use the Camel, possibly with supporting pieces, to counter-attack on the opposite wing – there is a risk involved because the Gold Elephant may decide to abandon the Horse in order to pursue the Silver Camel
* launch an Elephant and Horse Attack on the same wing – if both armies can maintain 2 defenders on the traps then a curious, but temporary, stalemate sometimes occurs
* launch an Elephant and Horse Attack on the opposite wing – this is much riskier than an attack on the same wing because mutual attrition followed by a Rabbit race on opposite wings becomes a distinct possibility
* create a distraction for the Gold Elephant so that the c6 trap will be abandoned

Another tactic that the defender can use with the Silver Elephant on c5, Silver Horse on b7 and Gold Horse on b6 is to pull the attacking Horse down to b5 (returning the Elephant to c5) and then move the defending horse onto b6.  From the d6 square, the Gold Elephant cannot assist the Gold Horse in returning to b6.  Similarly, if there was a defending piece on c7, the Silver Elephant could pull the Gold Horse to c6 and then occupy b6 with the Silver Horse.  This would force the Gold Horse to escape through the c7 square (if possible) in order to avoid being framed.

== Ideas for Setup ==

An Elephant and Horse Attack can be commenced with the first moves of the game, and for this reason nearly all players setup either Horses or the Camel on the b2, g2, b7 and g7 squares.  The Horses on these files have the dual purpose of threatening, and defending against, an Elephant and Horse Attack.  A balanced distribution of forces is essential for defending against an attack; if one home trap is defended with 2 Horses and a Camel, the opposing player is likely to attack the opposite trap.

Most players like to assign their Camels in a defensive role during the opening of the game.  For those players, the Camel is an ideal defender against the Elephant and Horse Attack and is often setup in the middle or behind a trap and, more importantly, the Camel’s mobility should be maintained during the game so that it can easily move from one home trap to the other.  Players that do not use the Camel defensively against the Elephant and Horse Attack may setup with it located on the ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘g’ or ‘h’ file for possible offensive action.

Dogs and Cats are very often setup behind the home traps.  They are very effective in those positions but they will require three supporting pieces to maintain a Horse frame on the trap.  Another possibility is to setup Dogs and Cats on a2, a7, h2, or h7 for the job of unfreezing the trap defenders that are attacked by the enemy Elephant on the ‘b’ and ‘g’ files.  This is sometimes preferable to advancing Rabbits for the same purpose.

At the current time, most players like to setup four Rabbits on the ‘a’ and ‘h’ files and no Rabbits on the ‘d’ and ‘e’ files.  There are several ideas behind this setup related to this chapter:
* Rabbits in the middle of the home territory may become obstacles for defensive pieces that desire to move between traps, especially on the 2nd and 3rd ranks
* if the enemy Elephant attempts to pull a stronger piece from the 'b' or 'g' file then the 2nd rank 'a' or 'h' file Rabbit can be advanced to unfreeze the stronger piece with one fewer step than a 1st rank ‘a’ or ‘h’ file Rabbit
* Rabbits can be advanced on the perimeter more safely than in the middle
* outside, 2nd rank Rabbits are one step closer towards participating in an Elephant blockade on the ‘b’ file
* Rabbits advanced up the middle of the board may be exploited by the enemy to blockade the friendly Elephant in the 6th rank middle
* players that prefer to generate goal threats on the outside, rather than the middle of the board, like to stack extra Rabbits on the 'a' and 'h' files

Against an opponent that enjoys using the Elephant and Horse Attack, it is not recommended to place Rabbits behind a home trap on c2, f2, c7 or f7.  They are awkward and vulnerable defenders against the E+H Attack.

== If Both Camels Have Been Trapped ==

If each player traps the enemy Camel plus one Horse, the strategic situation will be identical to the one that arises after all four Horses are trapped and the Camels remain on the board (because the relative strengths and distribution of pieces are equivalent).  Therefore, if each side has no Camel and one Horse, the Elephant and Horse Attack contains all of the risks that would be associated with an Elephant and Camel Attack with four pieces removed from the board.  As such, both players should consider alternative strategies that do not expose the second strongest remaining piece to a hostage situation.

== If Attacker’s Camel Has Been Trapped ==

If the attacker has already lost the Camel (hopefully some compensatory enemy piece(s) were captured), then the Elephant and Horse Attack is usually a strategic mistake.  It involves all of the same risks that were discussed in the Elephant and Camel Attack chapter due to the power of the unopposed enemy Camel; only in exceptional circumstances would the attack be beneficial.

A player that has lost the Camel but gained smaller piece(s) as compensation should instead consider strategies that involve goal threats, blockades, obtaining a Camel hostage, or creating an open tactical game in which the enemy Camel cannot effectively participate.

== If Defender’s Camel Has Been Trapped ==

If the opposing player has already lost the Camel in exchange for a couple of weaker pieces, there are differences of opinion amongst Arimaa experts about whether the side with the Camel should use the Lone Elephant Attack or the Elephant and Horse Attack.  The ideal strategy can vary considerably from one situation to the next, so both players will need to rely upon judgement and experience rather than relying upon rules carved in stone.

== Horse Frame Theories ==

:Aaaaah... after reading the comment in the talk page for game manuals, I can see how there was some confusion. In case you don't see the message there, I will repeat it here. The &quot;Good luck!&quot; was not sarcastic. It is included in the official {{tl|welcome}} template. I just noticed your name a lot and thought I'd welcome you to the Wikibooks community.

== VFD ==

In response to some of your comments on [[WB:VFD]] I have copied some text from Wikipedia:
* [[w:Wikipedia:Assume good faith|Assume good faith]]. Wikibooks has worked remarkably well so far based on a policy of nearly complete freedom to edit. People come here to collaborate and write good articles.
* Treat others as you would have them treat you.
* Be polite, please! 
**People can't see you or know for sure your mood. Irony isn't always obvious, and blunt, raw text can easily appear rude. Be careful of the words you choose &amp;mdash; what you intended might not be what others think
* Argue facts, not personalities.
* Be [[w:Wikipedia:Civility|civil]].
* Although it's understandably difficult in a heated argument, if the other party is not as civil as you'd like them to be, make sure to be '''more''' civil than him or her, not less.
** That way at least you're not spiralling down to open conflict and name-calling by your own accord, you're actively doing something about it: taking a hit and refraining from hitting back -- everybody appreciates that (or at least they should).
** However, don't hesitate to let the other party know that you're not comfortable with their tone in a neutral way -- otherwise they might think you're too dense to understand their &quot;subtlety&quot;, and you'll involuntarily encourage them (e.g. &quot;I know you've been sarcastic above, but I don't think that's helping us resolve the issue. However, I don't think your argument stands because...&quot;).
* Be prepared to apologize. 
* Forgive and forget.

Thanks, [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 01:31, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Plotor. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Plotor~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt; 23:35, 17 March 2015 (UTC)

== Renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr”&gt;
This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

These types of attacks are rarely seen in the opening because the defensive setup on both sides is normally too sturdy to allow a successful attack by such weak invaders.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Pharaohs ==
Pharaohs were kings in ancient Egypt, considered by their subjects to be divine. The word &quot;Pharaoh&quot; literally means &quot;great house&quot;. This term refers to both the royal household in which the king dwelled and also the veneration and wonder the people held for the position. They were the most important people in the country of Egypt.  The Pharaoh's word was never questioned as he had supreme authority, represented by the crook and flail. Many gifts were given to him in his honor. It was common for a Pharaoh to marry his sibling to &quot;preserve the divinity within the blood line.&quot; Yet at the same time the Pharaohs had multiple wives, so the heir did not always come from the sibling-wife.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Safe Install (Xandros Networks)==
The recommended way of installing new software is to use a program called Xandros Networks, an application that installs, removes and updates software.
Xandros Networks can be launched from the desktop and the Launch menu.

===Common Applications===
From the menu on the left, select &quot;New Applications&quot;.  You will see a list of common software packages offered and tested by Xandros which are not found on your computer. To install any of these, simply click on the &quot;Install Now&quot; to the right of the software description.

===All Available Supported Applications===
Expanding the &quot;New Applications&quot; on the left reveals the software categories for all available supported software from Xandros Networks.  Selecting a category will reveal the software packages in that category.  To install one of these packages, selected the desired software package and click &quot;Install&quot;. 

===Searching for Software===
If you don't know the category or the name of the software you want to install, you can search for it.  Enter the name or type of software you want in the text box in the top-right corner of the window and click the &quot;Search&quot; button.

==Easy Install (Autopackage)==
Autopackage is a simple way to install software on a wide variety of Linux distributions.

To install your first software from Autopackage:
#Go to the [http://autopackage.org/downloads.html Autopackage Downloads site].
#Download the software package you want to install and save it on your computer.
#Go to the folder where you saved the software package.
#Click on the package with your right mouse button.
#Click on the Properties menu item.
#Select the Permissions tab.
#Check the top-most &quot;Exec&quot; checkbox.
#Click OK.
#Open the software package.

This is a one-time process.  After your first package software package from Autopackage has been installed, installing further software packages is as easy as downloading the file and double-clicking it.

: Oh, and in &quot;forums&quot;, to reply to a post, put a : in front of your text. Anyway, I've tried to get more people onboard, but no one seems to want to help. GFAQs people just want to vandalize :-/ Sleepywood people would rather create their own guides. But I'll get what i want eventually :) When the guide is big enough, people will start joining in.

: There has been some controversy on Game Guides on Wikibooks; however, they have seemed to revolve around the idea that Game Guides generally look like **** on Wikibooks. Look at the [[Starcraft]] Wikibook for example. Anyway, I'd like to help clean up the Maple Guide a bit, and if you don't want to, that is fine as well :) Other little things that may help... you can program new code into Wikibooks through &quot;templates&quot;. I've programmed a few in myself, so go on and use them. If you can't figure out how to use them, all you gotta do is put a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ then the template name and then }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

: I hope you help out more often as well :) Takes a bit of load off of me, and I'm sure it makes the guide better --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:30, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

:: I found an [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Maple_Story/MageGuide&amp;diff=309847&amp;oldid=308614 edit] on your mage guide dealing with your name... I'm not sure if this was by You or not, so I reverted it. Change it back with while logged in if you want to, and I'll stop reverting it.

::: Aight, cool. Remember, anyone can edit what you put up on a wiki, so some people like to screw up names and stuff. I try to keep an eye out for that kind of stuff... but it is hard to tell if it was you or someone else who wanted to screw up your name.

::: As for templates... they are kinda complex to make and use... A tutorial on one is [[Help:Template | here]], in the [[Help:Editing | Editing]] guide. The basics are simple though... As you can see on this page, there is the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:welcome}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template (click the edit bar). Templates can get &quot;parameters&quot; to change some of their text, so realy each template is used differently. The templates I've been making are listed on the [[Talk:Maple_Story#Templates|MapleStory talk]] page, and I've been trying to document them... still kinda hard to use/explain. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 12:38, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

== Brace for impact on MapleStory guide==
I'm going to Sleepywood to ask for help on the guide... but just as an FYI, generally 1 or 2 malicious people will come in and try to demolish the guide (if from GFAQS, about 5 of them will come :-/ ). If I'm not on for whatever reason, just know that you can go back to an old &quot;file&quot; in ~4 clicks.
# Click on the &quot;history&quot; on the top of the screen
# click on the date of the last good edit
# click on the edit button
# Click save page

This will save an old version as the &quot;main&quot; page, and thus, undoing whatever the other guys have done. You can go back on *any* history file. Every edit is saved as an edit, and can be undone in this way. (much much easier than combing through the article again). By clicking &quot;last&quot; and &quot;current&quot;, you can see the differences between the last version, and the current version. Pretty easy stuff, but I can see where someone could get confused.

Just know, whatever they do with mouse actions and so forth, you (or anyone) can undo in 4 clicks of a button :) (plus the possibility of being banned from editing, more on that later) Admins , can do it in 1 click, and [[User:Derbeth]] generally gets the obvious vandalisms in an instant (they got a little program that scans all edits).

Of course, only do that when it is obviously a vandal. If they are posting misinformation (aka, they are n00bs who think too much of themselves) then move it into an FAQ section or something. (Like what I've done in the [[Maple_Story/BowmanGuide/Skills#Anti-Builds | Bowmen Anti-Builds]] section. ) If you aren't sure, post it up and the admin will talk to you. They are generally nice about those kinds of things :)

In the case of trying to find who the vandal is, just click on the &quot;last&quot; on the history file. You will see what he edited.

If it is too much, you can ask for Admins to ban a specific IP address or username on the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism_in_progress | Vandalism in Progress]] page.

Also, the admins have an idea of [[Wikibooks:Assume_good_faith]]. Basically, use common sense here. Dont ask someone to be banned because they are doing a newbie test (usually they are in the form of &quot;omfg, are you sure i can edit here?&quot;). But if they do it more than a few times... go ahead and ask them :) --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 13:00, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

Hmm, is this your own opinion or is this agreed by most Sins? Sleepywood guys don't seem to agree that high Endure is better than high Booster. Then again, I'm not a thief so blah.

: Well, I went ahead and tried to make Booster sound better, but still, look it over... I really dont know what I'm talking bout here anyway :) --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:25, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== brilliant ==

whoever wrote this document is a genius. My sincere thanks to you. IT will defenetely change the way i think. May God bless you.


==Recommendations for gender changes,etc.==
I think that the issue of making it gender neutral would defeat the purpose for having the article. It is after all, according to the title, &quot;a guide for getting a girl (for guys)..&quot; That being said, I think that to resolve the issue that there could be similar guides such as attracting women (for women) etc. The problem of removing gender, etc for a dating guide is that it would dramatically weaken the article and make it not much value for anyone, male or female trying to meet a woman. For example, straight men and lesbians almost certainly will have different takes on how to attract a woman, or even, which women they are more likely to try to meet.</text>

== strengthening argument example ==

I've shortened/simplified sentences throughout argument section for easy clarity.  But I'm curious about the example.  The ToDo mentions to strengthen the example.  Can we rewrite the sample argument given by Stephanie Wolf?  Or should we create a new argumentative example?  And if we would rewrite her example, how should we make note that this is her example, but has since been reworked since first posting?  Karl Klint

I think it's okay to rewrite the essay as you see fit. There's already a disclaimer about how the essay has been changed. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 15:10, 3 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''3 types of services'''

==Service started by init==
 1. Configured in /etc/inittab
 2. Typically non-TCP/IP services,
         e.g. dial-in Modems, X windows system, serial ports
 3. Provide respawn capability
 '''4. Changes to inittab can be activated with init q'''

==Services launched by System V startup scripts==

 1. Process are started by System V init script method
 2. Program Name often end in 'd'
 3. Script takes start, stop, restart etc. arguments
 4. two ways to start services
        a. /etc/init.d/ldp start
        b. service ldp start
 5. To start service automatically in a runlevel, we need a start and kill symbolic link in appropriate run level '''/etc/rc.d/rc[0-6].d'''
 
==Service launched by xinetd==

1. unlike inetd xinetd does not require that the services in its configuration file be listed in /etc/services

2. It can do access control on all services based on:
   a. address of remote host
   b. time of access
   c. name of remote host
   d. domain name of remote host

3. It can prevent denial-of-access attacks by

 a. placing limits on the number of servers for each service (avoids process table overflows)
 b. placing an upper bound on the number of processes it will fork
 c. placing limits on the size of log files it creates
 d. placing limits on the number of connection a single host can initiate
 e. place limits on the rate of incoming connections
 f. discontinue services if the load exceeds specified limit

===Controlling access with 'hosts.allow' and 'hosts.deny' ===

'''ACCESS CONTROL FILES'''
 The access control software consults two files. The search stops at the first match:
 1· Access will be granted when a (daemon,client) pair matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.allow file.
 2· Otherwise, access will be denied when a (daemon,client) pair matches an entry in the /etc/hosts.deny file.
 3· Otherwise, access will be granted.
 A  Non-existing  access  control  file is treated as if it were an empty file. 
    Thus, access control can be turned off by providing no access control files.

=='chkconfig' to manager services==

'''Dones not modify current state of System V services'''

'''Changes to services managed my xinetd comes into effict immediatly'''

'''Can also manage xinetd services'''

'''Usage Example'''
 1.  chkconfig --list                                     :lists all services in all runlevels
 2.  chkconfig &lt;service&gt; list                             :lists &lt;service&gt; on/off status in all runlevels
 2.  chkconfig &lt;service&gt; on                               :enables service in runlevel 2,3,4 , and 5
 3.  chkconfig &lt;service&gt; off                              :disables service in runlevel 2,3,4 , and 5
 4.  chkconfig &lt;service&gt; add                              :ensures either a kill or start symbolic link is setup for every runlevel
 5.  chkconfig &lt;service&gt; del                              :removes service from chkconfig management
 6.  chkconfig --level &lt;levels&gt; &lt;service&gt; &lt;on|off|reset&gt;  :turn service on/off in specified levels

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page about DbC focuses on Design by Contract more closely
than its [[w:Design by contract|cousin]]. The reason is that
Eiffel's DbC (and that of very few other languages) provide close integration of
''complete'' DbC with all aspects of the respective language, ''and'' the respective language's
definitions.

__TOC__

== Designing by Contract ==

»Not without my abstract data types.«

First, Design by Contract applies to modules, to the routines in the
modules, to loops in subroutines, and between statements.  Exceptions
are involved, too. That is to say, you cannot have partial
contracts. Contracts involve the whole module at every level of
refinement.

If you set up a module(!) contract, the contract's clauses
apply to an entire module throughout its entire life time.
If you use a module that has a contract, you are obliged
to obey its visible rules.

There are two views of a module, the client's view, and
the supplier's view.  When you write a subroutine, and the subroutine
calls other subroutines contained in some module, then your subroutine
becomes a client of the module. The client sees two parts
of the module's contract:

# the module's invariants and
# the preconditions and the postconditions of the module's subroutines.

The module itself is considered a supplier from the clients point
of view, it supplies subroutines.
The supplier sees more of the module and adds some internal contract clauses,
so to speak. The supplier will have to provide, that is, write

# the module's invariants,
# the preconditions and the postconditions of the module's subroutines,
# loop invariants and loop variants,
# check instructions
# consistent exception handling

All of these are assertions, or, in the case of exceptions, consistent with assertions.

Check the presence of supporting facilities per language here: [[w:Design by contract]].

=== Assertions ===

The purpose of an assertion is twofold: First, it states expected values of (computed) variables and their relations. Second, it facilitates testing that the variables do have the values stated and that the relations are indeed true.  Being part of a program, assertions can be used as run-time checks of variables and their relations. But at the same time, assertions allow reasoning about the program before it is run. You use assertions for showing that a module, subroutine, loop, etc. is correct. 

Each assertion is a Boolean expression, and is either '''True''' or '''False'''.
Example:

 &lt;math&gt;s = 0&lt;/math&gt; '''or else''' &lt;math&gt;g(s) = 2 * t&lt;/math&gt;

There are two relations in the example involving two variables, some values are computed.
The two equality tests are either '''True''' or '''False''', and are connected by '''or else''',
a Boolean operator.

Taken to the module level, assertions can express requirements that a client must satisfy
when calling the module's subroutine. The requirements are stated as preconditions of
a subroutine, that is, assertions involving the subroutine's formal arguments and possibly other features of the module.
In return, a subroutine's postcondition describes what the subroutine will have to offer as a result.
Again, the postcondition is expressed using an assertion involving the subroutine's results and
possibly other features of the module. A typical subroutine description, ''part'' of the module's ''contract''
might look like this:

   pop
         {{Ada/--| remove the topmost item}}
      '''require'''
         has_items: '''not''' is_empty
      '''ensure'''
         one_less: count = '''old''' count - 1

The subroutine &lt;code&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; takes no argument, and it doesn't return anything.
However, it modifies the module, a stack. Therefore the pre- and postconditions
are assertions that refer to other features of the module, &lt;code&gt;is_empty&lt;/code&gt;
and &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt;. Useful names are attached to the assertions for reference.

To complete the contract, another assertion is added at the module level,
the module invariant. The relations of the module invariant inform the client
about the state of the module by saying what is guaranteed between each call of a subroutine
of the module. Example:

  '''invariant'''
     sensible_count: count &gt;= 0

Contract ''violations'' are assertions that evaluate to '''False'''.
Typically, when the program does not live up to its assertions, an exception is raised, because the program is obviously wrong.
The situation is then handled using the exception mechanisms of the language, bridled by the rules that Design by Contract requires.


Extensive program analysis based on assertions can in some cases be performed at compile time.
This amounts in a mechanical proof that certain checks are not necessary.
The checks can then be omitted from the compiled program. See [[w:SPARK programming language]].

----
:'''If an assertion is false, there is a bug in the program!'''
----

The reason is that the program does not produce the results that it must produce
according to the assertions. Here is a list of the possible assertions in Design by Contract
('''C''' means visible to clients (outside the module),
'''S''' means visible to supplier (inside the module)):

; Module Invariants (C, S): Module invariants assert what is true after initialisation of the module. They also assert the same truths before and after any execution of one of its subprograms.
; Preconditions (C, S): A precondition of a subprogram states what must be true before calling the subprogram. Usually, it expresses relations of (computed) module variables and subprogram parameters. Only if the precondition is true can the subprogram execute in order to fulfil its postcondition. 
; Postconditions (C, S): Postconditions state what will be true about (computed) variables and relations when the subprogram has finished successfully.
; (Loop variants) (S): A loop variant is an expression (of type Natural) whose value decreases towards zero on each iteration of the loop. Typically one of the variables of the loop is used to express this property. The loop variant guarantees ''termination''.
; Loop invariants (S): A loop invariant expresses a relation that is true when the loop is entered, or entered once more. The relation will name variables of interest to the loop.
; Checks (S): When a statement has executed, it will likely have changed the value of one or more variables by assignment. A check expresses the programmer's expectation of the relation between these variables after the assignment.

Preconditions P and postconditions Q of a subprogram &lt;tt&gt;S&lt;/tt&gt; frame
the subprogram in the sense of a [[w:Hoare_logic|Hoare triple]]:
&lt;center&gt;
{at least P} S {guarantees Q},
&lt;/center&gt;
''provided'' the module invariant is True before and after
the call! Notice this last requirement. The module must be in a known good state,
because the preconditions and the postconditions may refer to the module's state.

==== Design by contract is not input checking ====

By implication, the rule from above about false assertions means that
assertions are not to be used as replacements for input
validation. When you can't trust your input, use
means provided by your language in a conditional, like the
{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Valid}} attribute in Ada.
For example, calling
Sqrt{{Ada/delimiter|(}}x{{Ada/delimiter|)}} where
x = {{Ada/operator|-}}1{{Ada/delimiter|.}}23
is a bug in using &lt;tt&gt;Sqrt&lt;/tt&gt;, a violation of the contract.
The caller has failed to test x before sending it to
the math routine.

==== Assertions can't replace conditionals ====

Can you pass all kinds of numbers to &lt;tt&gt;Sqrt&lt;/tt&gt; and just prepare to
handle the exception raised when the precondition of &lt;tt&gt;Sqrt&lt;/tt&gt;
evaluates to false? In other words, can you deliberately ignore the
contract? The answer is no, for at least two reasons.

# If a module has been shown to be correct, assertion checking might have been turned off for this module, expecting that clients will fulfil their part of the contract. A contract violation by the caller could then go unnoticed and might produce a vastly erroneous computation.
# If the called subprogram is not &lt;tt&gt;Sqrt&lt;/tt&gt; but controls the speed of a train, you can't just pass invalid input until it doesn't happen to make the speed-control subprogram fail with an exception. Worse, see 1.

=== Example: A Stack ===

(This example is given in very minimal Ada notation, knowing that language support
for DbC is pretty good, in particular in Ada 2005, but limited.
Imagining '''require''', '''ensure''', and '''invariant''' in place of
the comments marked &lt;tt&gt;pre&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;post&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;inv&lt;/tt&gt;
will render the following closer to the Eiffel original. Use the facilities
that your language provides for expressing assertions and exception
handling.)

The exclamation points (`&lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;') below are only a notational device.
They stand for the facilities available with the respective languages.
Their meaning is only informative of the contract.

 {{Ada/keyword|generic}}
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Item {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|private}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | any definite type that permits assignment}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|package}} Stack {{Ada/keyword|is}}
 
    {{Ada/-- | last in first out storage, initially empty}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} is_empty {{Ada/keyword|return}} Boolean{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | is there an element on the stack?}}
    {{Ada/-- | ! post: result &amp;#61; (count &amp;#61; 0)}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} count {{Ada/keyword|return}} Natural{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | number of items currently on the stack}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} top {{Ada/keyword|return}} Item{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | the topmost item}}
    {{Ada/-- | ! pre: not is_empty}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} push{{Ada/delimiter|(}}x{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Item{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/--| add `x` on top of the stack}}
    {{Ada/--| ! post: count &amp;#61; old count + 1}}
    {{Ada/--| ! post: not is_empty}}
    {{Ada/--| ! post: top &amp;#61; x}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} pop{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/-- | remove the topmost item}}
    {{Ada/-- | ! pre: not is_empty}}
    {{Ada/-- | ! post: count &amp;#61; old count - 1}}
 
 
    {{Ada/-- | ! inv: count &gt;&amp;#61; 0}}
    {{Ada/-- | ! inv: (count &amp;#61; 0) &amp;#61; is_empty}}
 
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Stack{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
Notice that up to this point, there is no executable statement in the
module. It's just a package specification with contractual pre- and
postconditions, and a module invariant.  Yet the module's contract is
complete as far as clients of this module are concerned.

The function &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; states as precondition that there
must be an element on the stack, otherwise it cannot succeed.
To express this, it refers to another function of the same
module, &lt;code&gt;is_empty&lt;/code&gt;.
Note that the module invariant does allow an empty stack.
The function &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; has neither precondition nor postcondition,
but is mentioned in a module invariant. This means that clients can still
expect that &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; returns a value &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;= 0&lt;/code&gt;

Now if
is_empty {{Ada/operator|1==}} False
then by
count {{Ada/operator|1=&gt;=}} 0,
count {{Ada/operator|1= &gt;}} 0
must be true because
{{Ada/keyword|not}} is_empty
if and only if
count {{Ada/operator|1=/=}} 0.

----
:'''A software component is correct in the sense of these contracts if you finally prove it, using the assertions and rules from the language definition.'''
----

The internal view of the module, in this case a package body,
shows how assertions can be placed in an program.
It is important to understand that {{Ada/keyword|pragma}} assert
in Ada, '''require''' in Eiffel, etc. are tightly integrated
with the languages' exception handling mechanisms. This is
unlike what you might be guessing if you know C's assert.
(The implementation of the example stack is actually based on Ada.Containers,
similar to how Eiffel's STACK classes are usually implemented. It could also be based on
[[http://www.digitalmars.com/d/dbc.html D]]'s
[[http://www.digitalmars.com/d/arrays.html arrays]], or whatever language you choose.)

 {{Ada/keyword|pragma}} Assertion_Policy{{Ada/delimiter|(}}Check{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   ...
    s{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Vector{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   ...
    {{Ada/keyword|function}} top {{Ada/keyword|return}} Item {{Ada/keyword|is}}
    {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
       {{Ada/keyword|pragma}} assert{{Ada/delimiter|(}}{{Ada/keyword|not}} is_empty{{Ada/delimiter|,}} &quot;stack is empty&quot;{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
       {{Ada/keyword|return}} s{{Ada/delimiter|.}}Last_Element{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
    {{Ada/keyword|end}} top{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
Think about the effects of turning assertion checking
on or off. Assertions express a contract, they do not
handle invalid input.

=== Exceptions and Contracts ===

What if a precondition is true, but some statement from
the executing subprogram raises an exception?
Chances are that the postcondition can no longer be
established by the subprogram. It will fail. However,
what about the state of the module?

The first answer to the question about the state of the module
is given by this rule:

----
:'''When an exception is allowed to propagate from the subprogram, the module invariant must first be established.'''
----

The second answer can be different, depending on the language.
The Eiffel way, for reference, is to retry the routine in case
of an exception:
If the exception is handled, and the subprogram should
retry to fulfil its postcondition, then both its
precondition, and the module invariant must first be established.
(Otherwise the system cannot act like invoking the routine again
without violating the contract.)

Ada, like some other languages, has nested blocks, so
exception handling could start from a block's preconditions.
Hence if you manage to restore the block's preconditions,
you can retry the block. A block may be nested inside a loop,
for example. Then your handler will have to assign
values to variables satisfying the necessary preconditions
of a loop execution.

=== Inheritance ===

TBD

In brief, the preconditions of overridden methods are or-ed,
the post-conditions are and-ed.

For modules built around derived types, it must be possible to
substitute an object of a derived type for an object of the parent
type such that a dispatching call can still rely on the parent's
contract. Likewise, the postconditions of the feature that gets
actually called must imply the postconditions of the parents'
features.

==== A Flaw ====

Given an OO parent type T, together with one of its methods,

  {{Ada/keyword|type}} T {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|tagged}} {{Ada/keyword|private}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
 
  {{Ada/keyword|function}} foo{{Ada/delimiter|(}}x{{Ada/delimiter|:}} T{{Ada/delimiter|;}} n{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Count{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} Natural{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
  {{Ada/-- |! pre: n &gt;&amp;#61; 42}}

and a type derived from T, called D, with the method overridden,

  {{Ada/keyword|type}} D {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|new}} T {{Ada/keyword|with}} {{Ada/keyword|private}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
  
  {{Ada/keyword|overriding}}
  {{Ada/keyword|function}} foo{{Ada/delimiter|(}}x{{Ada/delimiter|:}} D{{Ada/delimiter|;}} n{{Ada/delimiter|:}} Count{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} Natural{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
  {{Ada/-- |! pre: n &gt;&amp;#61; 66}}

imagine a reference to an OO variable of some type
in the T hierarchy. Then

  {{Ada/keyword|declare}}
      x{{Ada/delimiter|:}} {{Ada/keyword|access}} T{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Class}} {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/keyword|new}} D{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
  {{Ada/keyword|begin}}
      x{{Ada/delimiter|.}}foo{{Ada/delimiter|(}}42{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
  {{Ada/keyword|end}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

Who is to blame?

=== Concurrency ===

TBD

One new (to the discussion so far) problem introduced by concurrent execution is this:
Suppose

# a module's routines should do their work on behalf of more than one caller at a time,
# an &amp;ldquo;instance&amp;rdquo; of some routine may be interrupted by another &amp;ldquo;instance&amp;rdquo;

Then for example what was true about the module state when the first call was initiated
might no longer be true after executing the second call has changed the state
of the module. This extends to pre/postcondition checks:
Since the assertions of the routines will likely refer to
their module's state (and to anything visible in general), they can become inconsistent.

A first attempt at a solution is to make the precondition check, the execution
of a routine, and the postcondition check sequential and exclusive.
That is, as long as a caller is served by the routine, other calls to the
routine are made pending until the routine has finished.

But in addition, since the routine's assertions are about ''module'' state,
any service of the module called by any other caller should be put on hold.

interfaces).

== welcome ==

Hello and welcome to Wikibooks. Have you read [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]? Pages you're creating are not linked (every book should be placed in a [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves|bookshelf]]. Every book should also have proper chapter names, as it is written in the naming policy.

If you have any questions, leave me a message. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:53, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

: I think you contribute useful material, the problem is that our visitors should be able to find them. I suggest you put your pages as chapters of [[Guide to UNIX]] (you can consult [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] who planned this book where to put your work). You could also gather your pages into a new book, but I don't think we need two books on the same subject. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:02, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

== subpages ==

I moved the subpages from your user page into your user namespace. If you have any questions, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:47, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

== thank you ==

Thank you for your &quot;[[Cryptography/Notes]]&quot;. It appears someone else thought they were useful enough to use in the [[Cryptography]] Wikibook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The collection of the numerical data is a VERY important aspect of statistics - any mistakes made or bias introduced during collection will be reflected in the analysis and the conclusions subsequently made based upon the data. If the data is not collected properly then at best the analysis will be a waste of time and at worst mislead with serious consequences.


If you collect data about TV-viewing by making a rapid door-to-door survay in your area then you are '''NOT''' obtaining information about the viewing habits in your neighbourhood, you are obtaining information about the viewing habits from the people in your neighbourhood ''who were in, answered the door and answered your questions''.

&lt;h3&gt; Interpretation of statistics &lt;/h3&gt;
One of the first things that students of statistics must recognise is that the results extracted from numbers can be interpreted wrongly, or by (abused) selection deliberately distorted. To avoid errors, it is essential that the statistician:
a) Be extremely careful in selecting informaiton to avoid [[biased]] results.
b) Make only those deductions as are strictly logical.
c) Beware of &quot;third party&quot; sources of correlation.

&lt;h3&gt; Biased sources &lt;/h3&gt;
One of the problems facing a statistician is that the sources of information may be biased. A statistician must always ask questions such as:
a) ''Who'' says this?
b) ''Why'' does he say it?
c) ''What does he/she stand to gain'' from saying it?
d) ''How&quot; does he/she ''know''?
e) Could he/she be ''lying''? Or ''guessing''?
f) Is there ''another explanation''?

== Populations ==
We call the group of people (or items) about which we want to obtain information the ''population''. Defining the population is sometimes tricky, and sometimes the full extent of the population may not be known - for example the number of people with un-diagnosed AIDS is inherently unknown.

== Samples ==
If the population is relatively small and easily surveyed we may examine every item in the population. However usually the population is either too big or too expensive or too inaccessible to survey every item, and so you may have to be satisfied with examining only a part, or ''sample'' of the total population.

=== Sample frame ===
A list of the entire population from which items can be selected to form a sample is called a sample frame.

=== Costs, accuracy and samples ===
Although it may appear better to survey the whole population than rely on a small sample, this is often not so. Firstly it may be expensive, with the costs exceeding the value of the results.
Sometimes sampling only a fraction of the population can result in improved accuracy because very careful attention can be given to a small sample that time limits or the availability of skilled surveyors will not allow for a whole population survey.

== Methods of collection ==
Collection of statistical data is generally achieved by one of (or a combination of) the following methods:
a) Direct measurement
b) Interviewing
c) Abstration of data from published statistics
d) Indirect questionnaire 
f) Solicitation

=== Direct observation ===
This is usually the best method, as it reduces the chance of incorrect data and you have control over the quality of the data being recorded, it is also one of the most expensive. In some cases it is not possible - you cannot observe where people would go on holiday if they had unlimited money.

=== Interviewing ===
Interviews can be an effective technique, but only if considerable care is taken in how the questions are framed and the answers collated. 
The results from interviews can also be misleading because the responder may (a) mis-understand the question, (b) have forgotten some of the information, (c) lie in an attempt to provide the ''right'' answer, (d) lie to hide the truth. 
Different standards in how interviewers record the results can also produce distortion. If the questioner asks &quot;did you watch XYZ on TV last night - yes or no&quot; and gets the response &quot;part of it&quot;, is this a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot;?

=== Abstraction of data from published statistics ===
Data that has been collected by or directly for an investigation is ''primary data'', and the investigator should be fully aware of the conditions and limitations of that data.
Data that is extracted from information that was collected by another investigation is ''secondary data'', and usually the investigator is not fully aware of the conditions and limitations of that data, however often this may be the only practical source of data (e.g. variations in coal production over the past 100 years).
The inherent limits on the investigators knowledge of the data mean that whenever use is to be made of data from published sources, that consideration is given as the purpose of the original data collection - and in particular would that purpose mean that there may be bias if you use the data for your investigation.

=== Indirect questionnaire ===
The indirect questionnaire is typified by the postal questionnaire - it arrives unsolicited, is expected to be completed and then returned by post, although the modern version may also arrive electronically. This is usually the least satisfactory method of data collection for the simple reason that only a few such questionnaires are ever returned (15% would be good), and those that are returned may show strong bias, since the return is done only by those who have a sufficiently strong interest in the subject or by those with an intent to mislead.
There is an exception in most countries - and that is the statutory Census where force of law applies to its completion, although the census authorities still need to use checking interviews to verify the data.

=== Solicitation ===
Solicitation is typified by the &quot;suggestions box&quot;, by the &quot;complaints box&quot;. Data collected is almost worthless. Unfortunately it is a method that is being widely used by some parts of the media in its modern form &quot;SMS this number ...&quot;, with the &quot;results&quot; then given high prominence. This method only produces data from those with sufficiently strong views to be bothered with the time/expense of completing the responses.

== Design of questionnaires ==
Whenever information is sought from people, it is essential that the questions are carefully constructed. The questions should:
a) Be simple to understand.
b) Be unambiguous.
c) Limit the possible responses (tick the pre-printed answer).
d) Be concise and short.
e) Be relevant to the respondent.
f) Align with the goal(s), objective(s)and purpose of the study.
g) Be meaningful to the respondent.
h) Have a clear focus
i) Not suggest the desired answer.
j) Be arranged in a logical sequence.

== Methods of sampling ==

=== Bias revisited ===
When we take a sample from a population, it is generally not advisable to take just the easiest items - we are seeking information about the whole population, and must therefore take our data from across the whole population without allowing any particular set from the population to have undue influence than it really warrants. Unfortunately it is not just suspected or known sources of undue influence that must be avoided, we must also beware of ''unsuspected'' sources of bias.

=== Random samples ===
The possibility of taking a sample with ''unsuspected'' bias may be reduced by taking a random sample. A random sample is a sample that has been selected in such a way that every item in the population has an equal chance of being selected.

Random samples are NOT perfect samples - a random sample (especially if small) is not necessarily a good cross section of the population. A random sample of people living in the UK could result in a sample of people that all live in London. A random sample does NOT guarantee a sample free from bias, it simply guarantees that the ''method of selection is free from bias''.

=== Quota sampling ===
If the population can be divided into different groups then it may be practical to set a quota for each of those different groups, and then randomly select within the groups.

=== Multi-stage sampling ===
Divide the population into groups and then randomly select a number of these groups for the next stage. Each of the selected groups is divided into sub-groups and a number of these sub-groups is randomly selected for the next stage. This process is repeated until the size of the sub-groups is sufficiently small.
This process is commonly used for limiting the travel involved with surveys, with each of the groupings representing different geographical areas.

=== Systematic sampling ===
This is a simple method - if you want a 10% sample of the size of bolts from a production line, then take every 10th bolt produced. This method is commonly used on a production line.

If there is something systematic in the way the production line works that means that there is a periodicity in the bolt manufacture every 10th bolt (the machinest knows that it will be tested), then the result will be biased. 

=== Stratified sampling ===
This is a refinement on quota sampling. If the relative size of each of the different population groups is known then it is possible to set the size of the quota for each of the population groups. If this process is performed well, then the results from stratified sampling usually show less bias than pure random sampling.

=== Convenience Sampling ===
Ths is NOT a scientific/statistical method of sampling but is unfortunately used by companies. Convenience sampling is selecting items based on how easy it is to get a response. For example standing outside a specific grocery store collecting data and then making general judgements on shopping habits. THIS is not true judgements and are biased. You did not collect data about the general shopping habits of the population, you collected data on shoppers who visited that specific store during those specific hours and who took the time to full in your questionnaire. IT is important to know these limitations.

=== Reporting methods used ===
Whatever method has been used to collect your data, it is essential that you document the method, and describe the limitations on that data. If you are using secondary data (i.e. data in a published source) then it is essential that the source of the data is fully documented. Only by taking the care to describe your data sources can the results from, and limitations of, your analysis be understood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hydroboration/oxidation is a two-step reaction that converts alkenes into alcohols with anti-Markovnikov regiochemistry.

First, borane, BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is allowed to react with the alkene. The boron atom will generally react with the less substituted carbon, and it will also donate a proton to the other carbon across the double bond. If there is an excess of the alkene, a trialkylborane will be formed.  That is, one molecule of borane can react with up to three molecules of the alkane if necessary.  Tetrahydrofuran, a cyclic ether, is usually used as a solvent for this first step in the reaction because it can form a complex with the borane that gives the boron atom a complete octet (boron only has 6 valence electrons when it is in pure borane, which makes it highly unstable.)

Now, we have a trialkylborane, which may be fine if that is what one is trying to synthesize, but most chemists are more interested in converting this borane intermediate into 3 alcohol molecules.  The way this is done is to react the trialkylborane with hydrogen peroxide in a basic, aqueous solution. This causes the borane intermediate to be converted into three molecules of an alcohol. B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is also produced, but is probably ignored by most chemists.

The &quot;how to avoid&quot; tips are confusing and not really helpful.  Keep a bent over stance? When? All the time? When fighting someone? Similarly if one is caught in a headlock, doesn't this imply that the aggressor was applying the element of surprise and/or their superior strength to thwart the somewhat obvious &quot;duck out from under their arms&quot; escape?

The escape technique shown could be improved as well.  In the first and third panels the victim is shown with their right arm hanging limply to the side.  It would be much better to use this arm to protect the face from punches.  Secondly the movement of twisting the body to place the shoulder in front of the aggressor is unneccessary and impractical if the aggressor has an especially tight or strong grip.  A better way to proceed is to reach around the back and grab the inside of the aggressor's left elbow with the left hand.  Alternative grips are grabbing the clothing on the back if the aggressor's elbow is not available due to the punching action described above, or if the aggressor is shirtless, reaching up to cup the underside of the left shoulder or reaching around the waist.

Third point of contention: in step three the aggressor is shown splaying his right arm open for apparently no reason.  In reality if an aggressor is serious he will often hold the head grip even after both combatants have landed on the ground.  This article should go on to explain how to properly escape from such a situation.

: The how to avoid the headlock tips are good. Protecting the face is a good tip to add. The images shown could be improved and perhaps replaced with drawings. I disagree with the body twist being uneccessary and impractical, this move is particulary effective vs a bigger, stronger attacker. Its a Ju-jitzu move and in reality I've used it a few times. Maybe the best thing to do is find someone who knows more about Ju-jitzu so it could be categorized properly. If you know more ways just add them, I'll call this the Ju-jitzu way till I learn more. [[User:Chrismo|Chrismo]] 02:50, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

Another point to remember is that when your arm is in front of the aggressors torso try to elbow them in the stomach. I have used this to good effect and it left me on my feet and the aggressor bent over. This is a desirable position to be in as you have the opportunity to run or if need be to strike again.


This page needs more general guidelines to defending against a headlock. (And btw, &quot;How to Defend Against the Headlock&quot; would probably be better than &quot;How To Escape the Headlock&quot; since it encompasses avoiding the headlock in addition to escaping from it, but perhaps I'm being too picky.) Specifically, I was taught in kenpo karate to 1.) be aware of your environment so that you don't end up in headlocks, and 2.) if you're in a headlock, you tuck your chin, regain your posture by stepping forwards and staying low (almost like you're kneeling), and counterstriking fast, at the moment you land if possible (counter-striking being anything from a punch or an elbow to a very effective pinch to the opponent's inner thigh.) I think general guidelines like these would work in more situations than specific movements like the one in the photographs.

In addition, I have an issue with &quot;Keep a stance that is more bent over than straight up.&quot; It's always best to keep better posture than your opponent when fighting, and you can't do that by bending over while your opponent's standing up. I don't doubt it'd make it harder for him to get a headlock on you, but it'd make it easier for him to punch you in the ribs, grab you and pull you in a direction you don't expect, etc. [[User:66.189.116.168|66.189.116.168]] 04:53, 3 September 2006 (UTC) John S.

== Is this a textbook? ==

Well, no need for me to go on my usual rant. :) --[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 16:04, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

:We've already brought this one up for VFD, and the concensus was that this currently is not a textbook, but it is suitable material for a future book on the topic of self-defense. This page currently exists for that sole purpose. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:10, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

This book serves as an introduction to the field of microprocessor design and implementation. It is intended for students in computer science or computer or electrical engineering who are in the third or fourth years of an undergraduate degree. While the focus of this book will be on Microprocessors, many of the concepts will apply to other ASIC design tasks as well.

The reader should have prior knowledge in [[Digital Circuits]] and possibly some background in [[Semiconductors]] although it isn't strictly necessary. The reader also should know at least one [[Subject:Assembly languages|Assembly Language]]. Knowledge of higher-level languages such as [[C Programming|C]] or [[C++]] may be useful as well, but are not required. Sections about soft-core design will require prior knowledge of [[Programmable Logic]], and a prior knowledge of at least one HDL.

{{merge to | Using Wikibooks/Print versions and PDFs }}

[[Image:Exquisite-print_printer.png|64px|right]]

The aim of Wikibooks is to create useful books. Sometimes people want to print a book. This is not easy because books at Wikibooks are divided into chapters on separate pages. However, anyone knowing how to use templates can easily create a print version of a book by automatically including all contents of a book onto a single page. Furthermore, with all content of a book on a single page, it is easier to create a PDF version of this book. This can be done automatically, for example using [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] or the &quot;Print to file&quot; feature of your browser (either to a pdf or PostScript file &amp;mdash; the ps is easily converted to pdf later).

Not every book needs a print version &amp;mdash; lots of books here are useful only online. But if you feel one might need to get a book printed &amp;mdash; '''be bold''' and create it. See '''[[:Category:Books with print version]]''' for a list of books that already have a single page version for continuous reading. Many of these may also be available as PDF Files.

== How to create print version ==
Generally, it is a good solution to learn from examples. See [[Python Programming/Print version]] and read these quick guidelines.

=== Preparing a book ===
No navigational templates used in a book should be printed. Check this using the &quot;Print preview&quot; function of your browser. To prevent a block of text from being printed, cover it with &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. Use &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;notice&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;class=&quot;notice metadata&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; for cleanup templates like {{tlx|stub}}, {{tlx|cleanup}}; or &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt; ... &lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Similarly, if you want some content to be displayed only in the print version but not at normal reading, use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; ... &lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Note that text inside this tag won't be visible in the page preview during editing, so you may want to copy it to [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]], edit it there and copy it back.

=== Creating separate page for print version ===
In brief:
# Create the page &lt;!--''Book:Print version'' or --&gt;''Book/Print version'' (for a book called ''Book'') and link to it from the TOC
# Insert the {{tlx|print version notice|Book|Book/Print_version}} template to the top of the book's Print version page.
# Copy the TOC as an ordered list
# Insert every chapter like a template, preceded by the chapter's title. Remember to include a chapter with the list of authors.
#: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; = Chapter name = &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
#: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; {{:Book/Chapter name}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

'''Do not cut-and-paste any text from a book to its print version (except TOC).'''

=== Linking from the book ===
{{Print version}}

Make a visible link to the print version from the book's cover or table of contents. You can simply insert the {{tl|print version}} template in the page ''Book'' if the page of the printed version is ''Book/Print version'' to create a box like the one shown. If you make your own links, it's a good practice to have a direct link to the edit page for the print version. Then people who want to change something in the print version won't have to wait until the whole book is loaded to click the &quot;edit&quot; button.
Some books have multiple printable versions; link to each of them from the book's table of contents -- see [[Help:Local manuals of style#Print versions]].

=== Lengthy print versions ===
Sometimes print versions become too lengthy&amp;mdash;in such cases, you should divide it into parts: ''Book/Print version/Part 1'', ''Book/Print version/Part 2''.

=== Copyright problems ===
Using [[w:fair use|fair use]] images in a book may mean that it can't be printed in many countries that don't have a ''fair use'' copyright law, and even in countries that do, books printed with fair use images may have restrictions placed upon them.  For example, there may be restrictions upon commercial sale of the book (for profit or not).  Because of this, '''always avoid fair use images''' if possible and try to replace them by free ones (you might try to search [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]). 

If you have to include fair use images, consider excluding them from print versions of the book. For example, you can exclude images with the &lt;tt&gt;noprint&lt;/tt&gt; markup as explained above.

Note that many &quot;free&quot; images require an attribution to their authors. In online wikibooks this requirement is fulfilled by the link from each image to its description page. In printed books, however, you have to add an explicit attribution for these images. In fact, it's a good practice to include an attribution for all images.

== Use of printed books ==
You can freely use, copy and sell printed Wikibooks. You don't have to get authors' agreements or share profit with them (see [[Wikibooks:Copyrights#Use in hardcopy|details]]).  Remember that Wikibooks has copyrighted content, and the copyright is owned by the contributors, not the Wikimedia Foundation. You can freely copy and use this copyrighted content because the authors have already given you permission to use it under the terms of the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]] and [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]].  Please read that license carefully if you plan on distributing Wikibooks content for the terms of use.  

If you want to have the content available under different terms, you have to contact all of the contributors to the Wikibook for permission, which may present some problems if you can't get ahold of some of them.  A very few Wikibooks are also available under a dual-licensing arrangement subject to different terms as well.  This should be clearly marked and noted on the front page of the Wikibook.

== PDF versions ==
===Simple rudimentary pdf ===
It's easy to create a rudimentary PDF file from a print version. You can use freely available software like [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] or [[w:PDFCreator|PDFCreator]], and proprietary software such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat.

Unfortunately the &quot;print versions&quot; do not contain proper pagination. Pagination, paginated tables of contents and indexes are added by editing the print version with a word processor and creating a PDF File.

===Pdf with pagination ===
Steps:
* Use your web browser to open and save the print version to your own computer as &quot;web page complete&quot; 
* use the HTML-compatible word processor of your choice to open the html file, convert html to a format the word processor, and add paginate the book. 
** In Microsoft Word, this can done by
*** opening the saved HTML file
*** saving it to a word file
*** adding table of content by selecting ''Insert &gt; Field &gt; Index and Tables &gt; TOC'' or ''Preferences-&gt; Table of contents'' for Word 2012 or later. 
*** adding page numbers to the footer
*** save it to a pdf file

The word-processed document can then be converted to PDF using [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]] or [[w:PDFCreator|PDFCreator]].

:'''Tips''': cut the book into numerous small HTML files using 'Wordpad' as a text editor if it will not convert to your word processor format. This allows you to locate offending sections etc. Small books can be copied to the clipboard and then pasted into your word processor. (see Talk for more tips).

Also a ready to publish &quot;print version&quot; takes as much effort as creating the book in the first place. There is an entire field out there, including Typesetting and Desktop Publishing, that deals with the subject. And there are dedicated programs like Adobe InDesign, Scribus, and LaTeX/TeX that are specifically made for the task of typesetting. Microsoft Word is suitable for the task, but anyone who plans on doing it in the long term will appreciate the advanced features like kerning, ligatures, word stretching and automatic quality justification algorithms that these programs offer. For example, LaTeX automatically generates Table of Contents and Indices for you.

=== MediaWiki to LaTeX ===
More than 75 % of books with PDF version currently available on the English Wikibooks have got a PDF version created with [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf MediaWiki to LaTeX]. Thanks to [[LaTeX]] the quality is comparable to professionally printed books.

===Upload and Link the pdf files ===
PDF files can be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons just like images. But remember: don't link to PDF like this: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:File.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. This causes the ''entire'' PDF to be downloaded when loading the page. Use &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:File:File.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; this will link to the PDF's description page &amp;mdash; or &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Media:File.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; for a direct download link. Remember to tag the file as GFDL and include the edition number in the comment. Also remember not to use a simple URL link to download the PDF, because the PDF will be shown in [[Special:Unusedimages|unused images list]]. Instead, use Media: link (for instance:  &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Media:Special_Relativity.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;). 

PDF files could previously be uploaded to Wikibooks but new files are now uploaded to Commons. If there is an existing PDF file in Wikibooks, this can be updated by the creator but not other users. If a different user wants to update a PDF file, the existing Wikibooks version will need to be deleted by an administrator for &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:File:file.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to point to the new version. Alternatively, the new PDF file can be given a different name.

A collection of a book's pages can be downloaded on-demand as a PDF file as well.  See [[Help:Collections]] for details.


To add a link to your wikibook page, insert 
&lt;pre&gt;
{{PDF version|pdf file name without .pdf|size kb, number pages|description}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
For example
&lt;pre&gt;
{{PDF version|Ada Programming|2,663 kb, 243 pages|Ada Programming}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Tips on PDF versions ===
Some lingo first of all. 12 points to a pica, 6 pica to an inch. Points usually measure vertical distance, pica usually measure horizontal distance. For example, the height of fonts are measured in points. Size 12 Roman font is about 12 points high. The width of columns are usually measured in pica.

* Golden Rule: Rules in layout and art ain't rules. If it looks good, then do it. Think of these as guidelines if you don't know where to start.
* Keep things consistent. Use templates in GUI based programs like Word or InDesign, or use macros in LaTeX to keep pages as a whole consistent. 
** Keep consistent spacing between lines. Usually 120% of the size of the font is used for paragraph reading. For example, size 12 font is spaced by ~14 points. Size 14 font would be spaced by ~16 points. Headlines, nameplates, and so forth don't follow this rule. Only body-text.
** When there is a picture, make sure the space between the words and the start of the picture is consistent. If it is inlined with the text, make sure all 3 or 4 sides of the picture are consistently spaced from the text. If the picture has its own space, say, centered with a caption, make sure the caption is consistently placed, along with the spaces away from the text above the picture as well as below.
* Don't do full justification unless it looks good! When you do full justification with an inadequate program, you easily can get &quot;rivers&quot; of whitespace that is distracting for the reader. Programs with better justification algorithms, like LaTeX or InDesign may still mess up if the columns are too narrow. The best solution is usually to change the wording of the paragraph, but switching to ragged right or increasing the column width helps as well.
* Hyphenation should only occur in full justification (both left side and right side lined up). Hyphenation in ragged right looks strange, and thoughts and words can get lost as the reader looks for the next line.
* Don't bold too many things. '''Bold''' can get '''in''' the '''way''' of your '''text''' in ''ways'' that ''softer'' italic ''emphasis'' doesn't. It is fine to bold headlines or other attention grabbers, but in the body text, try with soft italics first.
* If doing a complicated layout, try the 5 column layout (don't actually use 5 columns. Maybe merge the right 3, and merge the 2 left side columns for notes. Or merge 3 columns to inline a picture in the middle of the page), or the artists rule of 3 to create a layout.
* Know the difference between the hyphen, endash, and emdash. Emdash is the longest, and is used in as a punctuation mark. Endash is used as &quot;to&quot; between numbers. Hyphens are usually the shortest and connect words between lines and compound words.
* Finally: Read the PDF when you are done! Frequent trouble spots are tables, pictures, and the text around large headings. Keep an eye out for widows and orphans, or words on their own lines, or on the next page when a paragraph ends. Don't be afraid to change the words of a paragraph to fit the layout, in fact, it has to be done frequently.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Select the cell that the formula result is going to be displayed in. The formula can be constructed in the formula bar. Always need to put the ''='' sign before a formula. That is how Excel recognizes what you are entering as a formula. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Sign||Operation||Example
|-
| +||Addition||=A1+B1+C1+D1
|-
| -||Subtraction||=A1-A2
|-
|*||Multiplication||=C4*C5
|-
|/||Division||=C4/D4
|-
|(…)||Combination||=A1*(B1+C1)
|}

Click on the '''green checkmark''' to enter the formula, the '''red x''' to cancel the formula. 

==Autofill==
Autofill helps you fill in formulas quickly once you have constructed one in a cell. In order to Autofill, select the cell with the formula. Place your cursor so the small black cross appears in the lower right corner of the cell ('''+'''). Once that cursor is visible, simply drag your formula down the column (or across the row as the case may be). Autofill will change the cell references accordingly.  

''Note that cell references can also change automatically when you copy and paste a formula using the clipboard, unless you use an absolute cell reference (see below).''

E.g.: If the formula in A3 is &lt;tt&gt;=A1+A2&lt;/tt&gt;, when you drag that formula over to B3 then the formula becomes &lt;tt&gt;=B1+B2&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Cell References==
*''Relative Cell References'': cell references that change when the formula is autofilled into different cells, as in the example above.
*''Absolute Cell References:'' if you don't want a certain part of your cell reference to change when you copy the formula to a new cell, you need to put a $ in front of the row and/or column part of the reference (see example below).

E.g.: If the formula in A3 is &lt;tt&gt;=$A$1+A2&lt;/tt&gt;, when you drag that formula over to B3 the formula becomes &lt;tt&gt;=$A$1+B2&lt;/tt&gt;.

To quickly add the dollar symbols use the F4 key, which toggles four ways.  First press gives both row and column absolute, &lt;tt&gt;$A$1&lt;/tt&gt;, second press gives row absolute, &lt;tt&gt;A$1&lt;/tt&gt;, third press gives column absolute, &lt;tt&gt;$A1&lt;/tt&gt; and finally fourth press returns to fully relative, &lt;tt&gt;A1&lt;/tt&gt;.

==AutoSum==
The AutoSum button on the standard toolbar allows you to quickly insert the '''SUM''' function. Select the cell where you want to put the total and then click on the AutoSum button ( ). Excel will insert the '''SUM''' function and take a guess as to what cell range you’d like to sum. Check to make sure the cell range is correct, then press enter to accept the function.

==Functions==
[[Image:excel_formula.gif|right|The formula listed here is: (B4+25)/SUM(D5:F5) . B4 is a cell reference. 25 is a numeric constant. The slash is a division operator. SUM is a function. D5:F5 is a range reference.]]
Excel has created hundreds of functions that prevent you from having to write out complex or repetitive formulas yourself. The cells that you want to perform the function on are either listed, separated by commas, or included in a range of numbers, indicated by a colon in between the first number in the range and the last number in the range. 

Functions can be inserted by using the '''Insert''' menu, by clicking on the '''Paste Function''' icon on the Standard toolbar, or by typing &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; in the formula bar and choosing the function from the drop down list on the left. 

Functions can also be 'nested'; that is, inserted into larger functions, by using the appropriate amount of brackets.  
&lt;tt&gt;=AVERAGE(SUM(B2:F2), SUM(B3:F3)) &lt;/tt&gt;

==The Function Wizard==
You can quickly generate valid functions using the function wizard.  To open it, click the function wizard button in the formula toolbar ( ). It provides a description of the function you select (in this case '''AVERAGE'''), a space for you to enter in the range or numbers (in Number1) and previews the Formula Result. You can select a range from your sheet rather than typing it in manually by clicking on the little button with the red arrow to the right of the Value box.

[[Image:excel_average.gif|center|frame|The function wizard allows you to build custom functions to suit your specialized needs. It also offers many built in functions which you can utilize.]]

==AutoCalculate==
Excel will automatically perform calculation on a set of cells that you select and display the results on the status bar. The default calculation is the SUM function, but you can change the calculation by right-clicking (Win) or '''Command + clicking''' (Mac) on the '''AutoCalculate '''result.

You state:
:it no longer naturally overflows with abundant resources, 
I think that this is a questionable statement.
and:
:and a population of six billion can only be sustained using the products of modern technology.
This is simply untrue.  The bulk of the world's six billion ihabitants ''is'' sustained without modern technology.  Only the less than a billion who inhabit North America and Europe are so dependent and even that is arguable.  Please don't take it that I disagree with the general point that I think you are making, that we live on a planet that is under increasing population pressure and that the eco-system is becoming more and more fragile.  However facile statements that cannot be backed up by hard facts simply play into the hands of the very extremists you hope to discourage.  Take a look at BP's world report on enrgy production and consumption, use the applet to chart all the world's primary energy equivalent consumption and the uncheck North America and Europe so that you can see how small a proportion the rest of the world uses. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 20:31, 15 December 2005 (UTC)


Hello Kwhitefoot. I've looked for the references that I used but can't find them. (I'll blame moving and discarding, but maybe they will turn up sometime.)

I wrote this: “The world is not what it used to be—it no longer naturally overflows with abundant resources, and a population of six billion can only be sustained using the products of modern technology”

But, IMHO, this statement is true, regardless of what BP’s research finds.

1. Surely we have greatly reduced—not eliminated, but on the way—much of the world’s oil and coal stores, fish and numerous animal/insect species, rain-forests, and endangered much else with our pollutants, perhaps making some dangerous to consume.

2. And how many of the 6 billion could live if everyone sought what might be produced without fertilisers, machinery to grow and transport food, etc?

3. And would everyone live as the very poor do in China, Africa, India? Wouldn't the world's average lifestyle be reduced to that?

I not only think that modern technology sustains us, I think that it adds greatly to our mental outlook. It certainly gives me more opportunities to find a “better life.”  It means that I can live in a healthy environment, enjoy modern media, travel, and even think that the world might oneday become a “better place” for everyone.  Wouldn’t you agree?

However, maybe the world could sustain 6 billion people without modern technology. (But, if  everyone had the same standard of living, I would hate to live in such a place! How about you, would you like to live in such a place?)

: Hello Kwhitefoot.
: I haven't been able to find the original references, but Global Footprints was part of it. Here is their site:  http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/rio/focus/report/english/footprint/
: And here are some quotes:
: “Accepting 12 percent as the magic number for biodiversity preservation, one can calculate that from the approximately 2 hectares per capita of biologically productive area that exists on our planet, only 1.7 hectares per capita are available for human use.”  http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/rio/focus/report/english/footprint/benchmark.htm
: and, “Footprints are too large. Most countries presented in this report live on footprints larger than what their own ecosystems can support. On a global basis and even by conservative measures, humanity’s footprint has overshot global capacities by over 35 percent.”
: “Population versus consumption. The numbers show the impact of both consumption and population. Clearly, the high levels of consumption in industrialized countries take the biggest share of the planet’s bounty. But with ever larger populations it becomes progressively less likely that a reasonable quality of life can be secured for everybody. Particularly the rapidly growing populations will lose their prospects even faster.” from http://www.ecouncil.ac.cr/rio/focus/report/english/footprint/numbers.htm

: It is more than energy use I was referring to. I know that this site is only one of many differing points of view. That’s one of the discussion points this book might raise, I guess. (But not one I anticipated!)  [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 14:29, 5 January 2006 (UTC)


== Linking Endnotes ==

When I started to read this module I found it annoying that I couldn't easily navigate to the end notes so as an example I have linked them to the endnote page.  You can see what I did by looking at the history and comparing the versions.  I think that the book needs to be 'wikified' if it is to be pleasant to read online.  It would be easier to read if each page had links to the next and previous pages as well as to the contents page.  Look at [Programming:Visual Basic Classic/Case Studies] or [Programming:Python Functions] for example. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 21:36, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

Yes, you are right. I am starting to do this--see Part One. I never seem to have enought time!!! [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 19:25, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

Oh! Now I see what you have done and I like that method. I'll make changes. David

== Why make universal if you have diversity ==
If the richness of today is diversity why make one universal religion? One might even argue that there is no universial way of life just alot point of vieuw's.

Also, making a universal religion implies that you will turn all religious texts into one book. If thats true, than that soundslike a collosal (impossible) work to me.

Maybe these 2 elements should be added to this chapter.


*But I think that I have done this. The last two paragraphs of this section state:

''&quot;Humanity needs, I think, a collective purpose. This would be in addition to our many individual and religious purposes. Under such a unified objective, individual moral behaviour not harmful to the collective good would properly remain individual choice, accruing concomitant rewards as believed to come before or after that individual’s death. However, the world’s collective guidance is a different matter. It should be obtained from a purpose positioned far beyond any one individual’s reach. This purpose should shine as a beacon to nations, guiding many generations. And its rewards should accrue to the living, not the dead, enriching the lives of all.''

''&quot;While no one should be expected to abandon their inherited or chosen religion, none should be prevented from adopting an additional universal purpose to guide their moral behaviour. No one should be asked to change what they have come to believe about themselves and their ultimate individual destiny, or to deny the god they worship. But an overarching universal purpose, used to guide humanity’s collective behaviour should also exist—something that clearly helps ensure our species’ and life’s well-being and continuance.&quot;''

And I have tried to present a rationale for doing this in several earlier sections. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 12:51, 14 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

==The Variable &quot;y&quot;==

I have also used the variable &quot;y&quot; to represent AD.  Such as in the GDP of the U.S. is &lt;br&gt;
y=c+i+g+x-m&lt;br&gt;
If someone else can validate this, perhaps we can add this as another alternative to the &quot;AE&quot; expression also noted.

==Net Exports==

It should probably be noted somewhere that X - M is sometimes refered to as Net Exports or &quot;NX&quot;. -[[User:Chapium|Chapium]] 00:39, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Eroyce. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Eroyce~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This page is going to serve as a basic FAQ for people who are new to assembly language programming.

== How Does the Computer Read/Understand Assembly? ==

The computer doesn't really &quot;read&quot; or &quot;understand&quot; anything ''per se'', since a computer has no awareness nor consciousness, but that's beside the point. The fact is that the computer cannot read the assembly language that you write. Your assembler will convert the assembly language into a form of binary information called &quot;machine code&quot; that your computer uses to perform its operations. If you don't assemble the code, it's complete gibberish to the computer.

That said, assembly is important because each assembly instruction usually relates to just a single machine code, and it is possible for &quot;mere mortals&quot; to do this task directly with nothing but a blank sheet of paper, a pencil, and an assembly instruction reference book.  Indeed, in the early days of computers this was a common task and even required in some instances &quot;hand assembling&quot; machine instructions for some basic computer programs.  A classical example of this was done by [[w:Steve Wozniak|Steve Wozniak]], when he hand assembled the entire Integer BASIC interpreter into 6502 machine code for use on his initial [[w:Apple I|Apple I]] computer. It should be noted, however, that such tasks done for commercially distributed software are so rare that they deserve special mention from that fact alone.  Very, very few programmers have actually done this for more than a few instructions, and even then only for a classroom assignment.

== Is it the Same On Windows/DOS/Linux? ==

The answers to this question are yes and no. The basic x86 machine code is dependent only on the processor. The x86 versions of Windows and Linux are obviously built on the x86 machine code. There are a few differences between Linux and Windows programming in x86 Assembly:

#On a Linux computer, the most popular assemblers are the GAS assembler, which uses the AT&amp;T syntax for writing code, and the Netwide Assembler, also known as NASM, which uses a syntax similar to MASM.
#On a Windows computer, the most popular assembler is MASM, which uses the Intel syntax but also, a lot of Windows Users use NASM.
#The available software interrupts, and their functions, are different on Windows and Linux.
#The available code libraries are different on Windows and Linux.

Using the same assembler, the basic assembly code written on each Operating System is basically the same, except you interact with Windows differently than you interact with Linux.

== Which Assembler is Best? ==

The short answer is that none of the assemblers is better than any other; it's a matter of personal preference.

The long answer is that different assemblers have different capabilities, drawbacks, etc. If you only know GAS syntax, then you will probably want to use GAS. If you know Intel syntax and are working on a Windows machine, you might want to use MASM. If you don't like some of the quirks or complexities of MASM and GAS, you might want to try FASM or NASM. We will cover the differences between the different assemblers in section 2.

== Do I Need to Know Assembly? ==

You don't ''need'' to know assembly for most computer tasks, but it can definitely be useful. Learning assembly is not about learning a new programming language. If you are going to start a new programming project (unless that project is a bootloader, a device driver, or a kernel), then you will probably want to avoid assembly like the plague. An exception to this could be if you absolutely need to squeeze the last bits of performance out of a congested inner loop and your compiler is producing suboptimal code. Keep in mind, though, that premature optimization is the root of all evil, although some computing-intense realtime tasks can only be optimized sufficiently if optimization techniques are understood and planned for from the start.

However, learning assembly gives you a particular insight into how your computer works on the inside. When you program in a higher-level language like C or Ada, all your code will eventually need to be converted into machine code instructions so your computer can execute them. Understanding the limits of exactly what the processor can do, at the most basic level, will also help when programming a higher-level language.

== How Should I Format my Code? ==

Most assemblers require that assembly code instructions each appear on their own line and are separated by a carriage return. Most assemblers also allow for whitespace to appear between instructions, operands, etc. Exactly how you format code is up to you, although there are some common ways:

One way keeps everything lined up:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
Label1:
mov ax, bx
add ax, bx
jmp Label3
Label2:
mov ax, cx
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way keeps all the labels in one column and all the instructions in another column:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
Label1: mov ax, bx
        add ax, bx
        jmp Label3
Label2: mov ax, cx
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way puts labels on their own lines and indents instructions slightly:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
Label1:
   mov ax, bx
   add ax, bx
   jmp Label3
Label2:
   mov ax, cx
...
&lt;/source&gt;

Yet another way separates labels and instructions into separate columns AND keeps labels on their own lines:

&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;
Label1:
        mov ax, bx
        add ax, bx
        jmp Label3
Label2:
        mov ax, cx
...
&lt;/source&gt;

So there are different ways to do it, but there are some general rules that assembly programmers generally follow:

#Make your labels obvious, so other programmers can see where they are.
#More structure (indents) will make your code easier to read.
#Use comments to explain what you are doing. The meaning of a piece of assembly code can often not be immediately clear.

== Comments ==

When writing code, it is very helpful to use some comments explaining what is going on. A comment is a section of regular text that the assembler ignores when turning the assembly code into the machine code. In assembly comments are usually denoted with a semicolon &quot;;&quot;, although GAS uses &quot;#&quot; for single line comments and &quot;/* ... */&quot; for multi-line comments.

Here is an example:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
Label1:
   mov ax, bx    ;move contents of bx into ax
   add ax, bx    ;add the contents of bx into ax
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Everything after the semicolon, on the same line, is ignored. Let's show another example:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
Label1:
   mov ax, bx
   ;mov cx, ax
   ...
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, the assembler never sees the second instruction &quot;mov cx, ax&quot;, because it ignores everything after the semicolon. When someone reads the code in the future they will find the comments and hopefully try to figure out what the programmer intended.

== HLA Comments ==

The [[X86 Assembly/HLA Syntax|HLA assembler]] also has the ability to write comments in C or [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code|C++ style]], but we can't use the semicolons. This is because in HLA, the semicolons are used at the end of every instruction:
&lt;source lang=asm&gt;
mov(ax, bx); //This is a C++ comment.
/*mov(cx, ax);  everything between the slash-stars is commented out. 
                This is a C comment*/
&lt;/source&gt;
[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions#Comments|C++ comments]] go all the way to the end of the line, but C comments go on for many lines from the &quot;/*&quot; all the way until the &quot;*/&quot;. For a better understanding of C and C++ comments in HLA, see [[Programming:C]] or the [[C++|C++ Wikibooks]].

I assume that you mean America when you say, ''the West''.  I suspect that most North Western Europeans abandoned such ideas long ago, especially the limitless expansion part. Misattribution of opinions weakens arguments.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 21:53, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Salviadivinorum-healthy.jpg|right|thumb|A ''Salvia divinorum'' plant.]]

Salvia (Sage) is a common perennial herb that grows throughout the world. The plant grows to be several feet tall and has large light-green leaves. Salvia is a member of the mint family, and is considered a common garden plant. Most common forms of Salvia can be found in plant nurseries. They are not hallucinogenic and will only give users a headache if smoked.

Diviner's Sage, ''Salvia divinorum'' - commonly refered to as &quot;salvia&quot; - is one of the hundreds of species of the Salvia genus. It is not native to any place, although it is commonly grown in some parts of Mexico, and now grows wild in some parts of the Sierra Mazatec region.

==General==
Although some users take salvia recreationally at a very low dosage, it is not a &quot;party drug.&quot; Daniel Siebert, ethnobotanist and salvia advocate, remarks, &quot;...salvia is not 'fun' in the way that alcohol or cannabis can be. If you try to party with salvia, you will probably not have a good experience.&quot; He recommends that it be used for meditation, or other spiritual pursuits. [http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/438/salviabans.shtml]

The active chemical - salvinorin A - is the strongest naturally occurring psychoactive known to date. It has been used by natives for thousands of years to seek divine spiritual insight. The internet brought the plants psychoactive qualities to wider attention. In recent years several countries have introduced legislation to make prepared forms of the plant illegal. It remains legal in most of North America because of the lack of media attention, and the very small abuse potential. (See legality section below.)

There is no known lethal dosage of ''Salvia divinorum''. However, '''it is very strongly recommended that a trip sitter be present'''. Because of its short-lasting effects (when smoked), users can take turns being a sitter.

'''Before setting forth to explore the potential of this substance, please read this entire page!'''

==Legality==
{{Wikipediapar||Legal status of Salvia divinorum}}
This substance is illegal in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Germany and Belgium.[http://www.sagewisdom.org/legalstatus.html] It is legal in many other countries, including Austria, France, the United States, except for Kansas, Delaware, Florida, Tennessee, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana[http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/mtcode/50/32/2/50-32-222], North Dakota, Dallas Fort Worth, and Oklahoma

==Methods of Ingestion==
[[File:Salvia_divinorum_drug.jpg|right|thumb|Dried salvia leaves.]]
Salvia can be ingested in several ways that produce varying effects. A large amount of leaves can be chewed thoroughly to produce light but long lasting effects. More common is to smoke prepared extracts where the salvinorin A has been concentrated to several (Five to twenty-five times) the natural amount by weight. A butane torch is recommended to vaporize all of the salvinorin A, but a regular lighter is sufficient and will vaporize most of the salvinorin A. Most users find a regular lighter to be sufficient and the resulting smoke easier to keep in the lungs due to the lower temperature. 

Unlike some other substances such as marijuana and tobacco, the salvinorin A doesn't become absorbed immediately, so the smoker must hold the smoke in the lungs for a short period if he or she wants to absorb all of the salvinorin A, a generally accepted time frame to hold salvia smoke in is 20-40 seconds, or however long the smoker can hold in the smoke.

Generally salvia leaves and extracts are smoked using the same paraphernalia as [[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Marijuana|Cannabis]]. Bongs are considered best because the hits are bigger than any other widely used method of smoking. Furthermore, the water cools the smoke and makes it smoother, making the smoke easier to hold in. This in turn allows for optimum absorption of the salvinorin A.  

In order to vaporize the most salvinorin A, the flame from the lighter must be held on the salvia for the duration of the inhalation, because salvinorin A has a higher vaporization temperature than, for example, THC does in the case of cannabis.

Glass pipes are also used and a &quot;second best&quot; to bongs, mainly due to the fact that that they allow the lighter to be held on the salvia for the duration of the hit.  Pipes are ineffective in that, due to a smaller chamber, less smoke is able to be absorbed for each hit, and the smoke is hotter and more harsh than with the bong method due to lack of water filtration.  It is a rule of thumb that in order to receive the same level of intoxication, one must smoke three hits of a pipe to every one hit from a bong, although experienced pipe users might argue it is also a matter of technique.

Cigarettes will work, but not to an extent where they are considered efficient, this is because it is not common practice nor is it practical to hold a flame a cigarette, by the method's very nature.  Some effects will come from smoking it in a cigarette, and there is a clear period where effects peak, but they will be much milder than the other methods of smoking, and is likely only to produce either very mild hallucinations or visual distortions, or none at all.  It is possible to have psychedelic substance induced '''closed eye visuals''' that can come as a fantasy (commonly referred to as a &quot;trip&quot;) when smoking a salvia cigarette, but it is not common except in those with a high sensitivity to salvia.  It is also interesting to note that the peak of effects, although milder, is notably a few minutes longer than with other smoking methods, but this may be simply because the period where effects are in their peak starts before the smoker has finished his cigarette, and continue until the normal time has passed upon completion of the cigarette.  Salvia cigarettes are best when only raw dried leaves are used, as extracts are costly and seem to be less effective in cigarette form than the raw leaf.

Raw dried leaves can be smoked, but, except in users with low tolerance to salvinorin A, the full effect will not be achieved unless large amounts of leaf are smoked. The smoke is a bit harsh, and unlike most other substances, salvinorin A does not have a cumulative dosage effect - if the dosage is not completely consumed within one to two minutes, smoking further will do little to increase the effects.

Smoking salvia produces the most profound, but also the shortest lived effects.  The come on starts while the smoke is in the lungs, and can last any time from 10 seconds to a minute. This seems to vary on dose and user.  The come on feels like a rapid build of pressure and vibrations in the head and sometimes the body, and the speed of this pressure build can catch some users off guard and send them off on a bad &quot;trip&quot;. It is therefore important to prepare mentally for this before smoking salvia. The peak can last anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, depending on the dosage as well as the users own response to the substance.  Higher doses will typically yield longer peaks.  During the peak, a user who received a full strength dose can experience numerous powerful effects, including: visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, hallucinations of touch, smell, and taste, visual distortion, disassociation, synaesthesia (seeing music, tasting colors), anesthetic effects, loss of memory (forgetting things like you took a substance or where you were before the trip began), introspective thinking, regression to childhood, ego death (which, contrary to some rumors, only lasts for the duration of the peak), becoming objects, the impression of seeing through walls, stimulation, intensely skewed sense of time, and a spiritual sensation of witnessing, being near, being watched by, or merging with a mysterious good or evil force greater than yourself.  

All these potential effects are why some people find salvia to be too intense and do not choose to use it more than once.  The after effects are much gentler and consist basically of slowly and gently coming away from the peak back into sobriety.  The effects persist for about an hour and consist of initial dizziness that quickly wears off, euphoria, stimulation, a mild head buzz. Some people report artistic inclinations, a feeling of being at one with nature, and headaches.  All the after effects slowly and gradually wear off as the hour progresses. Because of this it is hard to know exactly when the effects wear off completely and when they become mild to the point of being imperceptible - perhaps rather too subtle a distinction.

Traditionally, the leaves are sublingually ingested.  The most common way for this to be done is what is called the quid method.  This entails of wrapping 6-20 fresh leaves together in a stick form, and slowly chewing on more and more of the quid, over the period of a half hour, eventually having the whole quid in your mouth, without swallowing it.  Swallowing salvia is ineffective since for all practical purposes, stomach acid breaks down salvinorin A, and you would have to swallow enormous amounts in order to receive significant effects.  Sublingual absorption generally produces milder effects than smoking and requires much larger doses in order to match the intensity experienced with smoking, but produces much longer lasting effects.  The come on period starts after 5 minutes and lasts 20-40 minutes; the peak lasts 40 minutes to an hour and a half, and the after effects last 3-6 hours.  Sublingual absorption is also said to have more of a euphoric effect both during and after the peak.  Extracts, although they can be quite costly, can also be used this way in order to cut down on the amount of bitter plant material that has to be held in the mouth. Doses for extracts can be 1.5-2 grams of 5x, 0.75-1 gram of 10x, 0.35-0.5 grams of 20x, in proportion to the strength of the extract.

==Effects==
Salvia is an extremely potent drug. Its effects are considered unsettling by some people, and as such, it is important to spend time preparing the setting of the use and your mindset before you use salvia. The first effects are what can be described as a building of pressure in the head, and sometimes of the body, this is sometimes accompanied by a sensation of vibration of the eyes.  This is known as the 'coming on' stage, and it can last anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute, and roughly 10-20 seconds after initial inhalation or last 20-40 minutes and start after 5 minutes if sublingually ingested.

The peak can last anywhere from 30 seconds (which is rare) to 15 minutes when smoked, and can last 40 minutes to an hour and a half when sublingually ingested, and can include the following profound effects: visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, hallucinations of touch, smell, and taste, visual distortion, disassociation, synaesthesia (seeing music, tasting colors), anesthetic effects, loss of memory (forgetting things like you took a substance or where you were before the trip began), introspective thinking, regression to childhood, ego death (which, contrary to some rumors, only lasts for the duration of the peak), becoming objects, the impression of seeing through walls, stimulation, intensely skewed sense of time, and a spiritual sensation of witnessing, being near, being watched by, or merging with a mysterious good or evil force greater than yourself. Another effect that occurs in the peak is bouts of laughter.  These laughing fits are usually labeled as involuntary, but some users claim have separated them from the other effects to submit that while they do seem to happen at random to the observer, the user will vouch that these laughing fits are almost always a response to the unusual images and scenes salvia hallucinations produce, and although this may be a knee jerk reaction, it is not what may be considered truly involuntary.  Depending on the mindset and setting going into the experience, salvia's peak can be a beautiful and fun experience, or a frightening and undesirable experience.  Salvia tends to be a psychotherapeutic substance in that it can bring past traumas, repressed memories, or regrets to the surface.  These traumas, repressed memories, or regrets can manifest in very blatant, or very vague ways, and salvia may bring up issues of the past that you are not ready to deal with at this point in time, if there is anything like this in your past and you are not at a place where you can deal with it, salvia is not something you should use, even if in the ideal mindset and setting.  If you do not have such issues unresolved in your past, and you are in the correct mindset and setting, salvia may be used as a pleasant and powerful tool for exploring your consciousness, and developing a base of insight for you to refine at a later time.  In a partial-dose (a dose that is incapable of completely removing you from reality), salvia can be a great recreational psychedelic/stimulant.  Although not ideal for large parties, salvia may be smoked for fun by a small group of friends. It is important to remember that '''salvia only works as a recreational drug in limited doses, and doses that produce a complete fantasy/trip effect would become unpleasant and potentially frightening in a recreational atmosphere, and those high doses are only good for personal exploration and insight!'''

The afterglow effect lasts for 30 minutes to an hour if smoked, and 3-6 hours if sublingually absorbed.  It starts as initial dizziness, which leads to gently tapering off euphoria, stimulation, visual distortion, a mild head buzz. Sometimes random, short lived hallucinations occur (usually only in high doses) and some people report feeling connected with nature, artistic inclinations. Headache has been reported as an occasional undesirable after-effect.

==Other important facts==

*Although the raw herb ''Salvia divinorum'' itself isn't especially potent, its psychoactive constituent salvinorin A is very potent, reaching threshold effects at 200 micrograms (0.0002 grams)

*Salvia is non-toxic:  Although it is unknown what the lethal dose (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of salvinorin A is, it is known that there has never been a death directly attributable to salvia or salvinorin A toxicity This is especially reassuring because most doses do not exceed 25 milligrams, though doses of 2 grams of salvinorin A have been recorded.

*The closest thing to a death ever being attributed to ''Salvia divinorum'' is the death of Brett Chidester of Delaware, was depressed and was using salvia.  His parents claim that salvia was causing his depression, and point to the fact that he smoked salvia a few hours before he committed suicide as evidence of the link.  However, salvia has never been known to cause people to manifest depression, and has never been known to since.  It is far more likely that he was depressed prior to his use with salvia, and was attracted to it by the unsubstantiated claims that salvinorin A had promising anti-depressant effects that were going around at the time.  If salvia played any part, it may have played a sort of catalyst role in reinforcing his depression, as mindset greatly affects experiences with salvia: if you go in to an experience depressed, it will very likely focus on depressing things. Thus it is extremely unlikely that salvia placed any thought into Brett's mind that was not already present in some form. This is a classic (and unfortunately tragic) case of why it is always said &lt;u&gt;''not to do salvia if you have some sort of issue''&lt;/u&gt;. If gone unchecked as it had been for months, the end of Brett's tale probably would have been the same even if salvia hadn't been introduced.  Brett's mother got a law passed in Delaware making ''Salvia divinorum'' an illegal drug there based on her son's suicide. It is a shame that a substance can get banned because of purely circumstantial connections to an event that, based on knowledge of the substance, it didn't really have. 

*Another reported salvia-related death was that of 21-year-old Ryan Santanna of Roosevelt Island. According to reports in March 2011, he &quot;dissolved into a fit of laughter about 2 minutes after smoking salvia[...] He made animal noises, looked at [his former girlfriend] as if he couldn't see her, pushed her inside the apartment, and then ran and jumped over the balcony. [...][Carolynn Santanna] says her 21-year-old brother would have never committed suicide. Yet, without warning, he jumped off his 15th floor balcony.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;1. Family says Ryan Santanna smoked salvia before leaping to his death on Roosevelt Island|http://7online.com/archive/8001683/&lt;/ref&gt;

*Salvia exhibits a reverse-tolerance effect - the effects of the substance become stronger with each use. It may take several uses before a user &quot;breaks through&quot; into the full effects of the substance.

*If you experience no effects from smoking the substances, there are at least four explanations. The first is that you did not hold in the smoke long enough. The longer, the better. The second is that salvia has no effects on you. 5-10% of the population will not be affected by salvia at all. The third is that you did not hold the flame onto the foliage long enough and the active chemicals were not vaporized. The fourth is that you overheated the herb and destroyed too great a proportion of the salvinorin.

*Make sure you '''keep''' the flame on the salvia and inhale as much as possible with one hit. Salvinorin A requires a lot of heat to vaporize, and if you don't supply it you are smoking plant. Conversely, it could be argued that excessive heat will incinerate the herb so thoroughly that the major portion of any salvinorin A present will be destroyed.

*Most users report that any strength of extract over '20x' is uncomfortably too intense. The answer to this, of course, is to ''smoke less'', preferably using a milligram scale to weigh out your doses.

*Salvia extracts use a measurement of &quot;x's&quot; to label strength in comparison to the raw leaf starting material, the &quot;x&quot; in this system is meant to represent the multiplication &quot;times&quot; symbol in math, and it means literally how it reads, if it reads &quot;10x&quot; that means &quot;10 times [the raw leaf]&quot;. This would be achieved by reapplying a solution of salvia extract to one tenth of the mass of extracted leaf compared to the amount of leaf from which it was originally extracted, thus giving ten times (&quot;10x&quot;) the original concentration of salvinorin A.

*Raw salvia leaf is on average 0.25% salvinorin A, therefore on the standardized scale for extract, pure salvinorin A would be 400x

*Raw ''Salvia divinorum'' leaf can vary in potency based on many factors, this means that different companies have different strength starting material to produce salvia extract, as a result, one producer's 10x extract may be unbelievably strong while another's 50x may be shamefully weak, is is important to find a supplier whose extracts remain consistent than to play a guessing game with potency. Also, it may be wise to order that company's raw leaf material and check its potency yourself to know how strong to expect that company's extracts.  This illustrates how the 'nX' system of assessing salvia potency is of limited usefulness and at times may be unhelpful, misleading or even dangerous.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Students, as you do know, the reason why heat exists is because it is merely just another form of energy. When you say, that you would rather avoid the heat, than get out of this universe! Without the existance of heat, many things would simply not be able to exist in the real world. Heat is what makes those brownies crisp. Heat is also what makes that ice melt.&quot;

Concepts:
-The 3 laws of thermodynamics.
-Entropy and enthalpy.

Problems
-the the stable temperature when combining hot and cold water.

application: cooking.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Physical intuition is best defined as the prediction of movement in which we humans usually can predict from common experience. New methods to take away the common confusion that students are frustrated by is by taking this to mind: 

                              &quot;nature before math.&quot;

What this means is that students commonly are taught in the &quot;cook book approach.&quot; The difference is that you will engage yourself in an immersive, interactive way which makes you think about the relationships of the derived laws.

Learning just basic physical intuition we can reasonably and logically conclude if the movement of the physical system seems to be right. By using a combination of physical laws, physical intuition, and diagrams, most if not all problems of classical physics can be solved. Another helpful skill is &quot;physical perspectives&quot; which can be used to analyze what the answer should look like.

We will employ the &quot;more, less, and contrast&quot; method to compare various situations. 

In order to build up skills of such intuition, observe the following experiences.

==Steps to developing excellent physical intuition ==

-Consults the equation and recognize the types of units involved in it.
-From common experience, See what would typically occur.
 Common experiences include:
 Geometry (the shape of things)
 Sports and forces (how things are related to sports) 
-Connect the equation and common experience together to get a better understanding
of the subject.
-Contruct diagrams and &quot;deconstruct&quot; the aesthetic diagram into a physical diagram.
-Make sense of the reasonableness of the numbers.
-Make the final prediction of what will happen.

== Sports: ==
-Parabolic motion-the position of the ball.
-Tennis: Spin, speed, angle-the motion of the ball
-Vectors-the amount of force in certain direction to produce such motion
-Vibration of sports instruments.
-Football: the pass
-Skating:Conservation of motion
-Friction


==Food ==
-kinetic and potential energy.
-Sugars,Carbohydrates, and Fats.

==Transportation ==
-the relationship of mass and speed/energy.

it is generally known that usually more massive things tend to accelerate slower. the example is the difference between driving a loaded car and an unloaded car.

-the difference between a loaded car and a unloaded car
-drag forces: the relationship of volume and speed.
-closed and open windows in a transportation vehicle
-Positions in bicycle riding that promote better speed.
-Carnot engines and general efficiency
-elastic and inelastic collisions.

''concepts appear more complex than they should be.''

I agree that far too much stuff is taught in a way that makes it sound far more complicated than it really is. I do what I can to untangle overly complicated &quot;explanations&quot;.
I think you might enjoy reading some people who are even more militant about keeping things as simple as possible:
* http://amasci.com/ by Bill Beaty (I hear he's starting to edit Wikipedia, and that can only be a good thing.) In particular, http://amasci.com/amateur/physerm1.html .
* the book [[w:QED (book)|QED]] by [[w:Richard Feynman]]
* the people at the [http://wiki.43folders.com/ 43 folders wiki].

Thank you for making Wikibooks easier to understand.

in actuality, what type of physics book are you trying to overhaul? anyways i'm sure it won't be to hard just to categorize the physics page by level of understanding.

also, you may notice that their are many books which are in the &quot;construction phase&quot;

should you try to note what books that you think in general are best suited for a general area?

:I was referring to the Physics C (mechanics) book -- the last time I checked, all that existed was a sort of cheat-sheet of equations, but I have some interest in renovating it to provide explanation behind the concepts, laws and equations.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called LockeShocke. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name LockeShocke~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Vista ==

When Windows Vista comes out, this book is going to need to be either extensively modified, or a number of additions are going to need to be made. Many parts of the API are expected to change, and the new Vista driver model implements user-mode drivers. Any suggestions on how to adapt to the changes? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Windows Programming|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:34, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

*I'm the guy mentioning Pelle's C under the Anonymous IP. Since I'm at the beginner stage in Windows Programming, I can't tell it's too relevant due to people's slow adoption of anything new. It's probably OK to just make a section or two, the way Hart's Windows System Programming book was updated to &quot;handle&quot; XP, 2003 and Win64. His 64-bit section goes more or less like: ''Current Status, Model, data types, API changes, migrating code and compiler issues.'' To tell the truth, I'm not happy OS's change so much and break compatibility. I'm a legacy guy who just patched windows 2000 machines for USA Daylight Savings this past weekends, and am darn proud :) --[[User:66.108.164.77|66.108.164.77]] 04:17, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

== UNICODE.... ==

I dont understant why unicode was removed from wikisource to be part of wikibooks/Windows Programming. Why &quot;windows programming&quot;? must i remake UNICODE table for other languages???? [[User:Sspecter|Sspecter]] 04:38, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:To the best of my knowledge it wasn't wanted on wikisource, and they were going to delete it. Instead of deleting the material, it was moved here to the [[Windows Programming]] book. There are two options:
:#Create a [[Unicode]] book, and link to that book from every other book that needs to discuss unicode in more detail
:#Add unicode material to every book that needs it. 
:Which ever you feel like doing is perfectly fine. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:32, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
::I would prefer much better to create a [[Unicode]] book. Can I move it? [[User:Sspecter|Sspecter]] 06:24, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
:::Go right ahead. If an editor doesn't like the change, he'll either take it to the talk page or revert it. But I think it'll be fine. :) Cheers, --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:29, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
The reason i want to change is that it was (for me) very hard to find this codes hidden between the mediawiki projects. Other people are having the same problem, proven by [[wikipedia:|the weird biggest article in wikipedia, about &quot;HTML decimal character references&quot;]] (wich is, in fact, a very ugly mistagged uncomplete unicode reference), voted 3 times for deletion and maintained. Check it out. [[User:Sspecter|Sspecter]] 06:37, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
:Hi. I tried to follow the link but it seems to have been removed. A second part is up, according to a search for '''decimal character references''' and is [[w:List_of_HTML_decimal_character_references%2C_Part_2|available via this link]]. I'm one guy (probably the ''only'' one besides Whiteknight but I don't know all my IP addresses) that recently added info to the [[Windows_Programming/Programming_Windows_with_OSS_Tools|OSS/Cygwin portion]] of this Wikibook. I should try and see if there's a unified ID for wikieverything accounts or create a new account for here.
:BTW, thanks, Whiteknight --this wikibook's first chapters are the glue that helped me fill gaps from books and web tutorials on Win32 for C++... &quot;Hello world&quot; teachers out there should spend more time defining what those new windows.h types and weird capitalized strings are about. I'll update the OSS section to add at least a mention to LCC-WIN32 and (non-open source?) Pelle's C, since they have GUI support that can substitute the need Visual Studio tools for simple projects. --[[User:198.83.125.201|198.83.125.201]] 00:37, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

== Assignments? ==

How about assignments to go along with the text?

: Personally, I usually ignore assignments.  How about examples that build a more complete application using many of the tasks discussed in the chapter?  For example, now that the reader's gone through the [[Windows Programming/Window Creation]] chapter and has read about menus, take them through building a simple program that invokes menus.

== Disappointed ==

I took a course on C programming in college, and since then have programmed recreationally in several languages. I'm only now starting to take interest in creating graphical programs, and I'm strongly disappointed in this Wikibook. I'm certain that if I already knew how to use the Win32 API this would make a fine reference, but as a teaching tool it falls short. If this is only intended for reference, could you include a warning stating so in the first paragraph? If this is intended to educate novices to GUI programming, I think significant rewriting is in order.

:In place of adding a warning why not contribute with the missing information :)  It is up for the book contributors to add or not the warning but placing it will be limiting the scope of the book and will make it very improbable that anyone will add or rewrite it to cover that subject.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:11, 22 February 2008 (UTC)

::First, because I am a beginner to the subject and cannot myself supply the imformation I believe this &quot;book&quot; needs. Second, because when non-established wiki users come and make significant changes to existing articles, Internet fights ensue.

:::Because you are a beginner is not an objection. You are not required to show any IDs or other cards here, so you should by default consider anyone a beginner (on the other hand no one is allowed to intentionally lie). If you are reading from other resources you can contribute without doing an exact copy (or even doing an exact copy if license allows it), this is a collaboration effort if you add something that is incorrect others will correct it later (we hope). Fights will only be created if contributors divergences can't be accommodated and then there are correct ways of handling them...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:13, 22 February 2008 (UTC)

:This whole website is a volunteer effort, and it doesnt make sense to be criticizing the intermittant efforts of our volunteers. I've written the vast majority of this book so far, but real-life obligations, and other projects, have prevented me from contributing much to this book recently. It's also good to remember that this book, and all other books here on this site, should be considered &quot;works in progress&quot;, not finished books. This book is certainly not in it's &quot;final&quot; condition, and it will improve when people take the time to improve it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:12, 22 February 2008 (UTC)

:All free windows GUI programming documents tend to be terrible. Microsoft just doesn't care (their gdi examples don't even compile), and the only good documentation is from books you have to pay for. Here or anywhere else on the web will just be abysmal. I hope this post saves many people valuable time. --[[User:V2os|V2os]] ([[User talk:V2os|talk]]) 02:24, 11 October 2008 (UTC)

== Windows programming in C++ for kids ==

Well I am giving this topic because I am a kid.And I have burning desire to program.I've found some useless books on C++ online that
teaches only console programming.Hell that Hello World console program.


include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() 

{        

        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World\n&quot;; 
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Press enter to continue...&quot;;
        cin.get();

}

I hate this program now.I am bored.But I like this book very much.So I
suggest that you create a usefull (not useless) books for kids like me.I am only 10 years old.But I know a little about programming.So,This is the reason

      <text xml:space="preserve">Who posted the information contained here so far?  I mean no offense since it does seem like a sincere and honest effort to accurately and concisely state the principles of law mentioned.  Still, I must say it seems EXTREMELY elementary.  It seems as though this is written by a 2L who learned out of an Emmanuel's outline and would not be able to argue the policies and principles behind the law and WHY a judge might chose to use a particular argument over another.

For instance, the parol evidence rule is not nearly so simple as it is stated here.  The Emmanuel's summary outline may make it that simple, but there are several well established exceptions to the parol evidence rule and none were mentioned here.  There are complex policy considerations that are behind the decision to allow oral testimony and the judge's personal philosophy about what role the courts should play and what role the judge herself should play will have a great influence on the decision.

I hope to make additions to this wikibook when I find the time, but I just wanted to point out for those who might consult this as a good source that things are far more complex than this makes it appear. ''unsigned comment by [[User:24.45.199.241|24.45.199.241]] at 04:44, 16 December 2005''

      <comment>Re-arrange everything, add a decent intro. Need to add an example musical stave notation.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Drum music is written down in one of two forms: as tablature, or in musical notation. The two forms are basically the same, and are fairly easily interchangable. The major difference is that in musical notation, rest symbols are used to denote timing, while in tabs, the spacing is used. In both, each individual instrument is written on own line, although sometimes multiple similar instruments, like cymbals, are written on the same line with different symbols. Most instruments can have multiple symbols denoting different ways to play them (for instance, on the hi-hat line, &quot;o&quot; commonly means open, which &quot;x&quot; means closed). 

Since Wikibooks doesn't support a musical stave feature, most lessons  in this book will be written in tabs. 

An example would be as follows
 HH|x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|
 Sn|----o-------o---|----o-------o---|

The above is a basic 4/4 drum beat, with the bass on counts one and three, the snare on counts two and four, the hi-hat on counts one, two, three, and four, and a hi-hat accent on the &quot;and&quot; of count four.

== Instruments ==
Different tab authors use different symbols for notation. You just have to be careful to read the specs at the start. And if you're playing a song you know, listen!

The symbols commonly used in this book are as follows:
 Cymbal = X
 Closed hi-hat (HH) = x 
 Open hi-hat (HH) = o
 Tom 1 (T1) = o
 Snare (Sn) = o
 Tom 2 (T2) = o
 Tom 3 (T3) = o
 Bass Drum (BD) = o

There are many types of cymbal, common notation will include
 Crash (Cr) = X
 Ride (Rd) = ^

== Other notation ==

If there are letters like &quot;R&quot; or &quot;L&quot; below the tab it is to indicate which hand to use on the note above it.

== Timing ==


A good way to learn timing is to count as you play. For standard rock beats, you are playing 4 beats (quarter notes) per bar. You count on these notes. You may also be playing 8th notes in between, as in the first example. For 8ths, you usually count &quot;and&quot;. Here's the first example again, with counting:
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp;
 HH|x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|
 Sn|----o-------o---|----o-------o---|
 BD|o-------o-------|o-------o-------|

You can also count 16ths in between the quarters and 8ths. You'd usually count this like &quot;one-ee-and-ah-two-ee-and-ah...&quot;, or &quot;1e&amp;a2e&amp;a3e&amp;a4e&amp;a&quot;. For some styles, you'll be playing 3/4, in which case you will only could to 3 in each bar: &quot;1 and 2 and 3 and 1...&quot;. For others, you'll be playing 4/4, but instead of playing 8ths, you'll play triplets (or 12ths). You can count 12ths like &quot;One and ah Two and ah Three and ah Four and ah&quot;, or &quot;1&amp;a2&amp;a3&amp;a4&amp;a&quot;.

You can play along with a metronome to keep good timing. Timing is an extremely key factor in playing drums. To help build speed, play each lesson at a comfortable tempo until you are become proficient, and then increase the speed of the metronome by an amount that is somewhat challenging. For endurance, play at a moderately slow tempo (for example, 16ths at 100bpm) for a set amount of time. Discipline is also a key factor. 

When learning beats, breaks down each part of the beat and plays it separately, for example playing only the hi-hat, then only the snare, then only the bass drum, and then bringing in another part, for example both hi-hat and snare, or hi-hat and bass drum, or only snare and bass drum, and then all the parts together.

== [[Ada Programming/All Chapters]] ==

I have tryied an ''All Chapters'' view like they have for C++ and Computer Science - however it does not work for our page layout :-(. And I am unshure if it is worth changing - there would be a lot of work involved for little gain. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:33, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

=== Can't view ===

I'm unable to view the page. Don't know whether is a problem of Wikibooks  or a problem with my connection. Nevertheless I can edit the page and have added 1st level titles to improve the TOC. At least in the Spanish Wikibook this tip was very useful ([[:es:Programación en Ada / Texto completo]]). Are there other layout problems? The page headers, the Lady image... Those ones might be corrected changing the template, if regarded necessary. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:47, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

=== Probably the &lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; ===

Main problem - I think - is the use '''&lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' - I hope to rectify that with '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''. Also the page might just be to big - after adding the keywords it stoped working.

=== Works now ===

But only with less chapters and use of &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. You can quickly find out about any missing by looking for the first '''&quot;Contents [hide]&quot;''' - if there is more then one '''&quot;[hide]&quot;''' then there is more then one '''&lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' on the page.

:Congratulations. I didn't know of this noinclude feature, it's useful. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 17:21, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

I am a high school science teacher, though my background is in chemistry. I figured that this would be a good place to share the resources I have created. Any clues on how to integrate premade activities/labs and very short summary notes in to what is already here? I can certainly come up with good mneumonics on the topics I have taught. Let me know. Please. --[[User:Purpill|Purpill]] 22:19, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

Posted by Darren Baird (physics teacher with the TDSB), Toronto, ON, July 26, 2007...

I am concerned with a number of issues with this module. 

1. Much of the language is very awkward. In most cases this just slows down the read, but in some places, it obfuscates the meaning in a way which hinders understanding. If you claim to be a teacher posting material to help, then fix you spelling errors and straighten up your language. If you are not a native english speaker, I understand, so hard feelings... but the criticism stands... if you expect your students to gain clarity from your work, then your work should be clear!

2. Where are the promised diagrams?

You have some kernals of good ideas here, but they are typically half formed ideas... you don't explicitly express any ideas... you allude to them then immediately move on... this more resembles my teaching notebook (intended for my eyes only) than anything I would allow in front of my students.

I am concerned with my borderline students stumbling accross this, reading the nonsense and becoming increasingly frustrated because they can't understand what is written. They would then blame themselves instead of the poor writing.

I will give specific comments, then make the edit... (be a part of the solution)

suggestions for rewrite for your intro paragraph as:

This book, Physics for highschoolers, will educate high school students upon the concepts of 
&quot;in&quot; not &quot;upon&quot;

physics, and how they apply to a regular high school students life. Likewise, this book will be similar to Hewitts conceptual physics approach which associates hard concepts to very 
&quot;with&quot; not &quot;to&quot;

manageable ways to understand life. This wikibooks is situated for people who would like to 
&quot;wikibooks&quot; should not be pluralized, 
&quot;situated&quot; is not correct word choice... &quot;designed&quot; or &quot;written&quot;. Actually until everything is cleaned up, I would say... &quot;will be designed for...&quot;

understand the hard concepts by observing an easy to read style, helpful diagrams, and hopefully get a laugh when learning about the true things in life.
word choice... &quot;nature&quot; not &quot;true things in life&quot;

Once again... are you a native English speaker?

----

I would like to reiterate the concerns and criticisms of the above user. As a high school student, who is genuinely interested in becoming a physicist, I find this book very hard to read.

I don't agree with the amount of time spent on creating small, imaginative stories in order to explain a concept, or to introduce a subject. Evidently, I intrepret the need to relate science to something else, as an indication that you may not fully understand the actual material enough to explain it thoroughly.

This book essentially needs more work from my honest opinion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Design patterns are used where the same set of needs comes up over and over again. They are standard and well-tested approaches to designing models, and you can build up a library of patterns to make it easier to design professional solutions.

Please note that the names of the patterns below are not official names, because Excel has no generally accepted patterns, but they have been created for the purposes of this book. You may not find these names used anywhere else.

== Tabular pattern ==

The tabular pattern below is one all spreadsheet users are familiar with.

This is the simplest and most obvious way to build models, and it is used for most business spreadsheets. 

It has two main problems:

1. the formulae must be copied down correctly in each column – this is a common error

2. it can be hard to check formulae, when they are crammed into successive columns. There is little room for any explanation, users can only see one formula at a time (unless they turn on the formula view, and then you can't see the values), and users can only see a few columns at a time. This means that as a model gets more complex, this pattern can become very difficult to follow, and even unworkable.

== Block pattern ==

In more complex models, it may be difficult to fit everything into one sheet using the tabular pattern above. 

The model can be divided into sections such as tax, depreciation, revenue cashflows, etc., and each of these can be put into a separate &quot;block&quot;, usually on a separate sheet. The results are then consolidated in a summary sheet.

This is a pattern commonly used in large finance models, e.g. for toll roads, power stations, etc., where a large number of cashflows are projected forward in time, and where the model can be broken up into logical chunks. The models can get very big, e.g. 15 meg, with 3,000-4,000 unique formulae.

[[Image:Blocks.GIF]]

The advantage is that each sheet can be checked independently, and each sheet is on a particular topic. When a problem is complex, it helps if you can check it a piece at a time.
   
'''More on project financing'''

While this approach helps break up a complex problem into bite-size chunks, it is important to check the connections between the chunks and ensure they link up properly, as large models can become very confusing. You also need to design the model very carefully because it will be very difficult to rearrange later.


== Merge pattern ==

The following approach is a powerful alternative to the tabular pattern. It works well where you have to carry out a series of calculations for many rows of data.

You first build a calculation sheet based on a single record of data, 
* showing that data at the top of the sheet, 
* listing any assumptions you need (explaining as you go), and then 
* setting out the calculations down the sheet, as spread out as you like.

The result is that, given any [[one]] of the data records (i.e. rows), you can produce the correct results clearly and accurately for that single row.

This has obvious benefits in making the calculations much easier to check than when they are crammed into columns on a single row, next to the data. Of course, there is no free lunch, and the disadvantage is that you can only do one row at a time, which is clumsy.

The next step is to use a dozen lines of VBA code to load each data record in turn into this sheet, calculate, and export the results for each record into a separate row on an output sheet. You end up with an output sheet with a row of results for each data record.

There are several advantages to this:
* you use a single set of worksheet calculations for all records – there is no need to copy them down all the rows for each record
* the calculations are much easier to check than the tabular pattern, because you can spread them out across an entire sheet, and you can pull any data record in to look at it in detail
* all the business logic is in the worksheet, not in VBA, which simply automates the process
* the data and results sheets are completely separate from the calculations sheet, and they have no formulae that can be messed up - this separation is a very important design principle
* if you want to print individual results for each record (e.g. you want to send out letters to each person), VBA can print a specially formatted output sheet for each record as it loops through them all

This approach requires more skill to build than the tabular approach, but the code can be made generic, so it does not require any changes, removing the need for programming skills.

An example will demonstrate best: click on this 
[[Image:Calculate one at a time.xls]], 
(then when the image page comes up, right click the link to the XLS file and &quot;Save As&quot; to download it).


== VBA pattern ==

VBA can be used to read in the data and assumptions, carry out all the calculations, and then put the results back in the sheet.

This is a very powerful approach where there are large amounts of data, or where a worksheet would be very slow, because 
* VBA can process data extremely quickly, and 
* it can read from and write to data files, databases and websites,
* and it is very compact, because all its calculations are done in memory and are discarded once the results are put back in a sheet

The power comes at a significant price, because 
* VBA requires sound programming skills
* it can be difficult to adapt later if it needs to change
* it can be very difficult to check, although one solution is to produce a test worksheet with selected outputs to make it easier to see what is happening

Generally, VBA should be used for complex models involving a lot of data, like a simulation or a very large datafile.

                16. So to get C^2, i just add up A^2 and B^2 and thats equal to 25. So the answer is 25 and the &quot;turnip root&quot; of 25

Joey Newton recent got into trouble by his parents. His parents, knowing that Joey was a strong kid with 9 Newtons of force, placed a 1 Kg bowling ball to his foot to prevent him from running away. To make things worse, Johnny has a really strong &quot;anti-Escape&quot; fan that exerts 3n on his foot.

From the following Problem, Figure out the answer given the following concepts:

A. What is the Force? (chapter 1:Force)
B. What is the Acceleration? (chapter 2: Acceleration)
A. W = Mass X gravity (chapter 4: Energy)


B. What is the net force of the problem, assuming his leg is &quot;actually&quot; the bowling ball.


The doodle/Diagram:
Basically its there to visualize problems and see how the concepts and the picture is related. One of the best concepts in which can
be gained by drawing out the diagrams is a better understanding of the materials. Usually by drawing such diagrams, the math to it
can be vastly simplified.

To aid in solving a problem, always assign the numbers which are given with their respective value.

Keywords for solving physics problems
The general keywords that usually appear in problems in
&quot;the object starts at rest&quot; = The initual velocity (Vo) is 0
&quot;the object stops at rest&quot;  = The final velocity (Vf) is 0
&quot;goes faster&quot; =Add  &quot;goes slower&quot; = Subtract
Distance, Displacement, Movement = the change from the final distance from the starting position.
&quot;north&quot; &quot;South&quot; -They either want you to use the pythagorean theorem or use vector diagrams 
elongates, stretches = gets bigger

{{BookCat}}
Also, try to imagine the 'physical situation' as given in the problem. for ex, if in the problem it is given that the 'wheel is rolling without slpping' try to imagine it in your head, and then go about solving the problems. Especially in mechanics it helps a lot.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergefrom|Linux For Newbies/Command Line}}

== Introduction ==
The command line interface (CLI or terminal) may seem intimidating at first, but it's important to remember that the command line is really, truly your friend. An army of tools are at your disposal that can take what would be a tedious and lengthy job (like removing the last four characters from every line of a lengthy file) and turn it into a two minute job.

For every Linux distribution the command line prompt will look a little different. For example, on one system you might see your username, the '@' symbol, the machine name, your current directory and the prompt.

        user@linux ~/$ 

This is a very common prompt. You may also see your username, a space, the fully qualified domain name of the computer, the full path to your present working directory followed by the prompt. In the example above 'user' is the username and 'linux' is the name of the host(computer) you are logged on.

        user linux.box.com /home/user$ 

The prompt varies from system to system based on a number of things. For example, it may be the default configuration set by the creators of your particular Linux distribution. It could also have been configured by the person who administors the computer. Maybe you, yourself, configured how you wanted your prompt to look.

The way you configure the look of your command prompt depends on what shell you use and the shell is the piece that most people commonly refer to as &quot;the command line&quot; when, in reality, it is simply a piece of software that provides an interface to the services of a kernel. The distinction between a 'shell' and the 'command line' is simply that a '''shell''' refers to a ''specific piece of software'' (e.g BASH, Tch, ksh, etc) that provides a '''command line interface'''. Most modern Linux systems use BASH (Bourne Again SHell) as the default shell.

=== A Little History ===
The commands used at the command line may seem a little cryptic due to their tendency to be very short. This is because the roots of the Linux command line are from systems where a single letter entry could take a significant amount of time to travel from a terminal, to a central server and back to the terminal where it was printed onto a roll of paper. In those old systems, the shorter the input was, the better as it meant less time waiting to issue your command and receive output. The best thing you can do to remember what commands stand for is to find out what word the command is an abbreviation for. This can go a long way to remembering the command later.

== Some Useful Terminal Commands ==

==== Summary of Common Commands ====
* ls - This command '''l'''ist'''s''' the contents of your present working directory.
* pwd - Shows you what your '''p'''resent '''w'''orking '''d'''irectory is.
* cd - Lets you '''c'''hange '''d'''irectories.
* rm - '''R'''e'''m'''oves one or more files.
* rmdir - '''R'''e'''m'''ove an empty '''dir'''ectory.
* mkdir - '''M'''a'''k'''e a '''dir'''ectory.
* ps - Provides a list of currently running '''p'''rocesse'''s'''.
* cp - '''C'''o'''p'''y a file.
* mv - '''M'''o'''v'''e a file (this is also used to rename a file, &quot;moving&quot; it from one file name to another.)
* grep - The '''g'''lobal '''r'''egular '''e'''xpression '''p'''rint program lets you search through a file or output of another program.
* find - Find a file on the filesystem
* man - Displays the '''man'''ual for most commands (including 'man').

; TIP: For help about a command, try ''man &lt;command&gt;'' which will bring up the manual for it. Note that some commands are built into your shell and do not have a man page, use your interpreter internal command (should be ''help &lt;command&gt;'').

==== Using Common Commands ====
===== Using ls =====
        user@linux ~/$ ls
        Afilez  Report.doc  aFilea  finances.xls  myPic.jpg  report1.doc  vacation pictures

You may notice from the example, default output of 'ls' that the files are not in strict alphabetical order. This is because the output is sorted on the numeric ASCII value of each letter. Because upper case letters have a lower ASCII value than lowercase letters, the returned result will always be files starting with upper case letters first. For example, if we add the file AZTRIP to the directory we will get 'AZTRIP' as the file listed first followed by 'Afilez' because the ASCII value of 'Z' is numerically lower than the ASCII value of 'f'.

If the ASCII values of letters has you confused, the important thing to remember here is that uppercase letters trump lowercase letters and will appear first in listings. The result is that files are first sorted by case and sorted alphabetically second.

The default output of ls isn't as useful as it could be. For example, given the output in the example, we don't know what are files and what are directories. We can likely guess that &quot;Afilez&quot;, &quot;aFilea&quot; and &quot;vacation pictures&quot; are all directories as they don't have an extension after the file name. To confirm this, we can pass the 'l' parameter to 'ls' to get &quot;long listing format&quot; output.

        user@linux ~/$ ls -l
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 163328 Jul 24 11:42 AZTRIP
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  11264 Jul 24 11:42 Afilez
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  22528 Jul 24 11:43 Report.doc
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  24576 Jul 24 11:42 aFilea
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 300032 Jul 24 11:43 finances.xls
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  47104 Jul 24 11:41 myPic.jpg
        -rw-r--r-- 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d  17920 Jul 24 11:43 report1.doc
        drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d      0 Jul 24 11:24 vacation pictures

The first character in the output above indicates the file type; where a dash indicates a file and the letter 'd' indicates a directory. From this output we see that the only directory is &quot;vacation pictures&quot;

; NOTE: Most systems have an alias on the ls command to include the '--color' flag so that the command highlights different file types with different colors. Directories are commonly shown in blue. If the output of your 'ls' command is always the same color, try &quot;ls --color&quot;.

; TIP: Another common parameter (also known as an &quot;argument&quot;) to the ls command is 'a' which shows all files including any hidden files and folders that start with a period. Arguments may also be combined together in a single block of letters. For example, &quot;ls -l -a&quot; can also be expressed as &quot;ls -la&quot;.

===== Using cd =====
The cd command lets you navigate from directory to directory on your system. The first thing you may need to know when using the cd command is that, unlike windows, Linux does not use the concept of drive letters. Instead, everything is somewhere within the root directory, '/', including other disk drives.

There's a couple ways to use cd to navigate to the directory you want. These are known as &quot;full path&quot; and &quot;relative path&quot;.

Full path always begins with the root directory '/'. For example, if we're in our home directory '/home/user' and we want to navigate to the 'vacation pictures' directory, we would issue the following command.

        user@linux ~/$ cd /home/user/vacation\ pictures
        user@linux vacation pictures/$ 

You may note that our prompt changed a little to indicate the directory we're currently in. This will be the case on most systems, but as previously discussed, this depends on how your shell is configured. You may also note the backslash between &quot;vacation&quot; and &quot; pictures&quot;. This backslash is known as the &quot;escape character&quot; and tells the cd command that the space is part of the directory name. If we omitted the backslash, the cd command would error and tell us that it could not find the directory &quot;vacation&quot;. If you don't like typing backslash or have a directory name with many spaces in it, you can use quotation marks around the path.

Relative path can start a number of ways, but always describes how to get to a specific directory from the directory you're currently in. To do this, we need to know how to move to directories that immediately surround the directory. These directories are parent directories and sub-directories

A sub-directory is any directory that is contained within the directory we're currently. Given the output below of &quot;ls -l&quot;, we see that chicago, florida and &quot;new york&quot; are all sub-directories to the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; directory.

        user@linux vacation pictures/$ ls -l
        drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 0 Jul 24 12:44 chicago
        drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 0 Jul 24 12:44 florida
        drwxr-xr-x 1 adrong mkgroup-l-d 0 Jul 24 12:44 new york

A parent directory is the directory that contains the folder that we are in. This makes the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; folder the parent of the &quot;chicago&quot;, &quot;florida&quot; and &quot;new york&quot; directories.

To cd to a sub-directory, you can start the path name with &quot;./&quot; which indicates the directory we're already in, or you can immediately start with the name of the sub-directory. For example, both of the following commands will change you to the &quot;florida&quot; directory.

        user@linux vacation pictures/$ cd ./florida
        user@linux florida/$ 

        user@linux vacation pictures/$ cd florida
        user@linux florida/$ 

To cd to a parent directory, you always specify &quot;../&quot;. The following command will return us to the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; directory.

        user@linux florida/$ cd ../
        user@linux vacation pictures/$ 

If we are already in the &quot;chicago&quot; directory and want to cd to &quot;new york&quot;, we must first tell the system we want to go up one level to the parent directory and then to the &quot;new york&quot; directory. We can do this by saying &quot;cd ../&quot; and then &quot;cd new\ york&quot; or we can do it as one step using the command below.

        user@linux chicago/$ cd &quot;../new york&quot;
        user@linux new york/$ 

; NOTE: Notice how we used quotation marks around the path to cd to the &quot;new york&quot; directory. We could have, instead used the backslash before the space and omitted the quotes to get the same result.

Similar to &quot;./&quot; and &quot;../&quot;, there's also &quot;~/&quot; which indicates the home directory of the user we're logged in as. If we wanted to cd to the &quot;vacation pictures&quot; folder while in the &quot;/usr/lib&quot; directory, we could do this with any of the following commands.

        user@linux lib/$ cd ~/vacation\ pictures
        user@linux lib/$ cd &quot;/home/user/vacation pictures&quot;
        user@linux lib/$ cd ../../home/user/vacation\ pictures

; TIP: Using the cd command without specifying a directory will return you to your home directory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The SI Unit System ==
If physical quantities are measured using different systems of units, the magnitudes would be different. It would become inconvenient and difficult to compare results. It has been also observed that the units of some physical quantities related to heat, light, current electricity, etc. have complicated relations with some basic physical quantities and can be expressed using them. The resulting units are therefore impractical. Taking these problems into account, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures recommended a new system of units, '''International System of Units'''(SI). SI units provide and international standard of measurement and are used widely.

So, there are seven base SI units.

==Base units==
;Meters (Distance)
:Describes the space between two locations. Think of the length of a highway or the distance between two cities. The definition of the meter has changed in the last few years. The meter was originally defined as one ten millionth of the distance from one of the Earth's poles to the equator.  The meter is now defined as the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.

;Kilograms (Mass)
:Describes how much matter an object has. Think of the difference between a small female gymnast and large male football player. The two athletes' bodies move differently because of their difference in mass. The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram. 

;Seconds (Time)
:Describes the passage of time or aging of the universe.The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom. 

;Kelvin (Thermodynamic temperature)
:The kelvin is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.

;Mole (Amount of substance mole)
:1. The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon 12; its symbol is &quot;mol.&quot; 
:2. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or specified groups of such particles. 

;Ampere (Electric current)
:The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 x 10^-7 newton per meter of length. 

;Candela (Luminous intensity)
:The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 x 1012 hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.

==Derived units==
;Force (N)
:The Newton is a product of Mass with Acceleration, representing a force. 
:1.0 N = 0.24 lbs of force, defining lbs using Earth's value of gravity

;Velocity (m/s)
:The motion of an object based on time, with a direction. Velocity is always specified with a direction, such as “12 miles per hour north”. 
:If the direction is not specified, it is called Speed.

;Acceleration (m/s^2)
:The rate at which an object is changing Velocity. 

;Momentum (kg m/s)
:The product of weight with speed. Note that heavy or fast objects have high momentums.

== Conversions ==
Though best learned in chemistry, conversion are simply ways in which you can represent a relative quantity.

Nano-10^-9
milli-10^-3
centi-10^-2
Kilo-10^3

Desktop environments and window managers are not the same. A desktop environment includes all the software needed for a desktop, including a window manager, but a window manager only manages the windows and does not include any other software. Sometimes window managers provide extra features, such as a pager.

=== Desktop environments ===
;[http://www.gnome.org GNOME][[File:JauntyGUI.png|thumb|Ubuntu 9.04 uses the GNOME desktop environment]]
:GNOME (pronounced /ɡəˈnoʊm/) is a desktop environment composed entirely of free and open source software. It is an international project that includes creating software development frameworks, selecting application software for the desktop, and working on the programs which manage application launching, file handling, and window and task management.
:GNOME is part of the GNU Project and can be used with various Unix-like operating systems, most notably those built on top of the Linux kernel and the GNU userland, and as part of the Java Desktop System in Solaris.
:See [[Using GNOME]]
{{-}}
;[http://www.kde.org KDE][[File:KDE 4.png|thumb|The K Desktop Environment]]
:KDE (pronounced /ˌkeɪdiːˈiː/) is a free software project based around its flagship product, a cross-platform desktop environment designed to run on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X systems. The goal of the project is to provide basic desktop functions and applications for daily needs as well as tools and documentation for developers to write stand-alone applications for the system. In this regard, the KDE project serves as an umbrella project for many standalone applications and smaller projects that are based on KDE technology. KDE software is based on the Qt toolkit. The original GPL version of this toolkit only existed for the X11 platform, but with the release of Qt 4, GPL versions are available for all platforms. This allows KDE software based on Qt 4 to also be distributed to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.
:See [[Using KDE]]
{{-}}
;[http://www.xfce.org/ XFCE][[File:Xfce-4.2.2.png|thumb|The lightweight XFCE desktop environment]]
:Xfce (pronounced as four individual letters) is a free software desktop environment for Unix and other Unix-like platforms, such as Linux, Solaris and BSD. It aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually appealing and easy to use.
:The current version, 4.6, is modular and reusable. It consists of separately packaged components that together provide the full functionality of the desktop environment, but which can be selected in subsets to create the user's preferred personal working environment. Xfce is mainly used for its ability to run a modern desktop environment on relatively modest hardware.
:It is based on the GTK+ 2 toolkit (the same as GNOME). It uses the Xfwm window manager. Its configuration is entirely mouse-driven, and the configuration files are hidden from the casual user.
{{-}}
&lt;div class=&quot;messagebox&quot; style=&quot;clear:all;&quot;&gt;Note: Both GNOME and KDE use comparatively higher system resources than XFCE and Fluxbox. So if you are on a old PC (eg., Pentium 200 MHz, or have less than 128 MB RAM) you should seriously consider XFCE and Fluxbox over the heavyweights. Same apply if you find KDE or GNOME somehow slow on your high end workstation. IceWM, though minimalist, is fast, reliable, themable, and less resource intensive than the others.&lt;/div&gt;

=== Window managers ===
;[http://www.compiz.org/ Compiz][[File:Xgl window switching.png|thumb|Compiz uses compositing and transparency to achieve attractive and useful effect, like window-switching, shown here.]][[File:Fedora-Core-6-AIGLX.png|thumb|Compiz's famous rotating desktop cube.]]
:Compiz is one of the first compositing window managers for the X Window System that uses 3D graphics hardware to create fast compositing desktop effects for window management. The effects, such as a minimization effect and a cube workspace are implemented as loadable plugins. Because it conforms to the Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual standard, Compiz can substitute for the default Metacity in GNOME or KWin in KDE.
:Compiz plugins include the famous cube effect (example to the right), Alt-Tab application-switching with live previews or icons, and a feature similar to Exposé.
{{-}}
;[http://www.enlightenment.org Enlightenment]
:Enlightenment, also known simply as E, is a stacking window manager for the X Window System which can be used alone or in conjunction with a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE. Enlightenment is often used as a substitute for a full desktop environment.
{{-}}
;[http://fluxbox.sf.net/ FLUXBOX][[File:Adesklets.jpg|thumb]][[File:Fluxbox.png|thumb]]
:Fluxbox is a stacking window manager for the X Window System with the aim to be lightweight. Its user interface has only a taskbar, a pop-up menu accessible by right-clicking on the desktop, and minimal support for graphical icons. All basic configurations are controlled by text files, including the construction of menus and the mapping of keybindings. Fluxbox has high compliance to the Extended Window Manager Hints specification.
:Fluxbox can show some eye candy: colors, gradients, borders, and several other basic appearance attributes can be specified. Recent versions support rounded corners and graphical elements.
:Because of its small memory footprint and quick loading time, Fluxbox is popular in many Live CDs such as Knoppix STD and GParted.
{{-}}
;[http://fvwm.org/ FVWM][[File:Fvwm wiki screen.png|thumb]]
:The F Virtual Window Manager is a virtual window manager for the X Window system. Originally a twm derivative, FVWM has evolved into a powerful and highly configurable environment for UNIX systems.
{{-}}
;[http://www.icewm.org/ IceWM][[File:Icewm1220.png|thumb]]
:IceWM is a stacking window manager for the X Window System graphical infrastructure. It is relatively lightweight in terms of memory and CPU usage, and comes with themes that allow it to imitate the GUI of Windows 95, OS/2, Motif, and other graphical user interfaces. IceWM is meant to excel in look and feel while being lightweight and customizable.
:IceWM can be configured from plain text files stored in a user's home directory, making it easy to customize and copy settings. IceWM has an optional, built-in taskbar with menu, tasks display, network and CPU meters, mail check and configurable clock. Official support for GNOME and KDE menus was previously available as a separate package. In recent IceWM versions, support for them is embedded. External graphical programs for editing configuration and menu exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''distribution''' is a type of Linux. Linux comes in a large number of distributions, some of which are designed for everyday use, and others designed with a specific task or device in mind. We'll discuss some of those differences below.

Most Linux distributions have a special type of CD, called a '''live CD'''. If you insert this CD and then restart your computer, the live CD will run Linux on the computer while avoiding changing anything on your computer as much as possible. For example it won't normally install any files on your PC, but run only from the CD. You can give the operating system a try to see if you like it without the risk of installing anything on your hard drive. You should remember that linux typically runs very fast - if the system seems slow, it is because it is running off your CD drive, not your hard drive.

==Choosing A Distro==
There are dozens of different Linux distributions. Here are some ways to help you narrow down the options to a short list.

;How do you intend to use the system?
:Desktop or server? This distinction is probably the most important. Distributions for the desktop will have a [[w:graphical user interface|graphical user interface]], while server distributions won't.
;Specific hardware requirements
:Try out a few LiveCDs of different distributions. Does it recognize and work properly with your hardware?
:If you intend to install Linux on a low-end specification computer, or you have other peculiar hardware compatibility problems or requirements, your choice might be influenced by this need. Most linux distributions should run fine on all but the lowest end of the spectrum.
;Application support
:Which applications or desktop environment are important to you?
:Does a given distribution install those programs by default or is it easy to install and integrate them with the rest or your system?
:Does the distribution have a good package management system, and suitable software repositories?
;Support
:What options will be available for getting support? Is commercial (paid) support available? Is there free community support? If the distribution has a small user base, you will have a harder time getting distribution-specific support, as compared to a more widely-used distribution.
;Desktop environment
:For desktop systems, you'll need to feel at home. Check out [[../Desktop environments]] for information on some common ones. GNOME and KDE are the two most popular.

Try a distro chooser, like http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/. Often several different distributions will meet all your requirements. Your final choice from the short list may be based on whim or personal taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
'''Welcome to the world of free and open source software!'''

Welcome to [[w:Linux|Linux]]! GNU/Linux is descended from the [[w:UNIX|UNIX]] operating system, but is [[w:open source|open source]] software, which means that you can view its source code and change it to suit your needs. Of course since this book is geared to those new to Linux, we stay away from very technical issues that are more suited to Linux veterans. This book is going to try to be geared toward the person who has heard about Linux and might be considering trying it out or perhaps the person who has already &quot;taken the plunge&quot; and is looking for more information or wondering where to start now that they have Linux installed. But first, a little history lesson.

The name &quot;Linux&quot; technically refers to an operating system &quot;kernel&quot;, a single but key component of a complete operating system. In everyday use, the term &quot;Linux&quot; is frequently used to refer to a complete operating system which consists of the kernel and some of the thousands of other programs required to make an operating system useful. Much of the important system software that is typically installed on a Linux system comes from [http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html The GNU Project], a project to build an operating system made entirely of free software. 

The first Linux kernel was created by [[w:Linus Torvalds|Linus Torvalds]]. It was first released on 5 Oct 1991. It was started as an x86-only, single-processor operating system, but grew to become one of the most ported pieces of software. Other parts of a complete GNU/Linux system come from other projects such as the GNU project, and are integrated into a complete GNU/Linux OS by your supplier. Usually your supplier will assign their own version number to the integrated whole.

The GNU Project is overseen by the [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]], founded by [[w:Richard Stallman|Richard Stallman]], who believes that the people should use the term &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; to refer to such an operating system, because so many of the required programs were in fact, written as part of the GNU Project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Starting Linux (Booting)==
When a computer is turned on, it normally begins the process of &quot;booting&quot; by reading software from the system's hard disk (or other [[w:non-volatile storage|non-volatile storage]] medium), and loading it into memory and then executing it. In this process the kernel is loaded and then various other system programs may be loaded.

A Linux system can be configured to boot up to one of several available &quot;run levels&quot;:
&lt;!--These don't apply to all distros - do we even need to talk about this now? runlevels are fairly advanced--&gt;
 0     Halt the system.
 1     Single-user mode (for special administration).
 2     Single User Mode with Networking
 3     Multi-User Mode - boot up in text mode
 4     Not yet Defined
 5     Multi-User Mode - boot up in X Windows
 6     Reboot.

===Debian===
The following quote from ''The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ'' explains how to add a custom procedure to a Debian or Debian based system boot:

''Suppose a system needs to execute script foo on start-up, or on entry to a particular (System V) runlevel. Then the system administrator should:

* ''Enter the script foo into the directory /etc/init.d/.''
* ''Run the Debian command update-rc.d with appropriate arguments, to set up links between the (command-line-specified) directories rc?.d and /etc/init.d/foo. Here, '?' is a number from 0 through 6 and corresponds to each of the System V runlevels.''
* ''Reboot the system.''

''The command update-rc.d will set up links between files in the directories rc?.d and the script in /etc/init.d/. Each link will begin with a 'S' or a 'K', followed by a number, followed by the name of the script. Scripts beginning with 'S' in /etc/rcN.d/ are executed when runlevel N is entered. Scripts beginning with a 'K' are executed when leaving runlevel N.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Representation of data==

Data that is presented in a systematic manner is much easier to understand. Consequently the next step after data collection is to lay the information out in an orderly way - usually as a table.

A well constructed table must have a) A clear, comprehensive, explanatory title b) Be systematically formated c) Identify the source of the data d) All units of measurment must be clearly stated (sometimes in the headings of the columns or rows) e) The headings to all columns and rows must be unambiguous - if it would be too long, then use a short title PLUS a footnote.

Systematic formating is the hard bit. Here you must ask yourself what is the purpose of the table: a) To present the data collected in an orderly manner b) To show distinct patterns in the data c) To summarise the data In most cases, good layout is obtained by first asking what data must be presented adjacent to each other and then asking supplementary questions such as should totals be shown, should percentages or other derived statistics be shown, or would they just clutter up the table.

== Combinations and Permutations ==
Permutation - The total number of ways of arranging ''r'' objects from ''n'', where order is important, e.g. choosing a school football team and positions, where anyone can play any position

Combination - The total number of ways of choosing ''r'' objects from ''n'', where order is not important, e.g. choosing three cards from a deck, so that you gain a 2, a 3 and a 4 '''in no particular order'''

Combinations - Use the button marked nCr on a calculator, or the formula
&lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}&lt;/math&gt;

Permutations - Use the button marked nPr on a calculator, or the formula
&lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}&lt;/math&gt;

== Probability ==
Syllabus Extract: 

(a) understand the terms permutation and combination;
(b) solve problems about selections, e.g. finding the number of ways in which a team of 3 men and
2 women can be selected from a group of 6 men and 5 women;
(c) solve problems about arrangements of objects in a line, including those involving
(i) repetition (e.g. the number of ways of arranging the letters of the word ‘NEEDLESS’),
(ii) restriction (e.g. the number of ways several people can stand in a line if 2 particular people
must — or must not — stand next to each other);
(d) evaluate probabilities in simple cases by means of enumeration of elementary events (e.g. for
the total score when two fair dice are thrown) or by calculation using permutations and
combinations;
(e) use addition and multiplication of probabilities, as appropriate, in simple cases;
(f) understand informally the meaning of exclusive and independent events, and calculate and use
conditional probabilities in simple cases, e.g. situations that can be represented by means of a
tree diagram.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{bicycles}}

'''Lights''' are an essential cycling accessory and any cyclist that intends to ride in dim lighting conditions, or poor weather such as fog or rain should not consider riding without lights.

==Why use lights?==

Although bikes sold for use on the roads are required to be supplied with reflectors, these really should not be relied on to keep you visible on the roads [http://sheldonbrown.com/reflectors.html]. Cyclists should be responsible for their own safety and acknowledge that not only are proper lights a common courtesy to other road users, they are one of the ways to promote your safety on the roads.
Darkness and bad weather can make cyclists almost invisible to other road users. A light may be the only thing that makes a driver or pedestrian realize that the faint shadow up ahead is actually a cyclist.

==Types of Lighting==

There is a wide selection of bicycle lights available, all with their own characteristics. It is definitely worth discussing your needs and cycling habits with the staff in the store you intend to buy your lights from.

There are generally three types of lighting used for bicycles, based around either Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), Halogen filament bulbs or High-Intensity Discharge (HID) bulbs. It is very rare to see lights based around other light sources, so unless they are expressly recommended by an expert they should be treated with caution when buying. 
Bicycle lights can also be powered by different means. The most common are ordinary batteries, rechargeable batteries, &quot;bottle&quot; dynamos and Hub dynamos.

==LED lighting systems==

LED lights are very popular amongst cyclists and have a number of excellent characteristics. They are lightweight, relatively cheap, bright, compact and reliable. They require very little maintenance- LEDs have a very long lifespan and don't need to be replaced like bulbs. LEDs are generally battery powered and give excellent battery life. Many LED lighting systems are also demountable; you can detach the lights and take them with you if you are going to leave your bike locked up in public. 

LED lights often come with the option of a variety of flashing modes, as well as a steady beam. While you are required by law to have lights attached to the frame that emit a steady beam, many cyclists also attach additional lights to their bike or clothing that are set to flash. Flashing lights tend to attract the attention of drivers and increase battery life although with LED there is little need to increase the battery life, especially if using rechargable batteries, and flashing lights can be distracting to other road users or cause you to be in more danger because it is more difficult to judge the distance of a flashing light.

One issue with LEDs is that they emit quite a narrow beam that appears weaker the further you move from the optimum viewing angle. All LED lights should have a light diffuser which will increase their effectiveness.

In 2014, modern high power white LEDs can be very bright, currently up to slightly over 1000 lumens from a single emitter and can completely replace older lighting systems under all conditions. 

===Halogen lighting systems===

Most cyclists find that LEDs do not provide a powerful enough beam to illuminate the road. This means that while they work very well as a tail light in all conditions and as a headlight in areas with street lighting they will not provide illumination of the way ahead like a car's headlights might. Cyclists that need to cycle down unlit roads often choose a Halogen light for their headlight. Halogen lights give a very bright beam for relatively low power consumption, although they are more power hungry than LED systems. They tend to be available with more power source options than LED lights, such as rechargeable batteries and dynamos. Because they use more batteries and produce more heat than LEDs, halogen lights also tend to be very slightly bigger and heavier than LEDs, the trade off being their superior performance for specialist use.

==Power Sources==

Bicycle lights are normally powered by either batteries or dynamos. The Key difference between batteries and dynamos is that, by using a dynamo you generate your own electricity to power the lights on your bike and by using batteries you get power from a disposable (and environmentally harmful) source. Both the lights and the generators for Dynamo systems are initially more expensive than battery powered lights, however this can be offset over the lifespan of the product by the fact that you are not paying to recharge or replace batteries. While most battery powered lights attach to the bike by a simple clip mechanism, meaning they can be removed to prevent theft, most dynamo lights have to remain clipped to the frame due to the wiring that connects them to the Dynamo.

==Battery power===

LED systems tend to run off battery power, as it provides a steady, constant, compact and lightweight source of power that suits the characteristics of LED systems. LEDs don't use battery power very quickly and are a very economical form of bicycle lighting. You can use your own rechargeable batteries but they tend not to come as standard



==Increasing your visibility==
Wear light coloured clothing and reflective or illuminated materials.
Make sure that the reflectors fitted to your bicycle are still attached. In the UK it is a legal requirement to have pedal reflectors and a rear reflector in addition to a white front light and a red rear light.
Many cyclists are struck by vehicles emerging from side streets so consider fitting additional reflectors that work from the sides. Reflectors are available that fit to the wheels or onto spokes.
Try to use lights that emit some light sideways as well as just forwards and backwards.
Use your lights in low visibility conditions, for example if it is raining heavily or foggy, or if you are cycling when the sun is low in the sky and could dazzle other road users.
Make sure that your lights are clean and that the batteries are in good condition.
If you do not have suitable lighting or are caught out by nightfall, walk your bike instead of riding home you are better of late than _the_ late.

==Tips==

Always check that the lights you buy are weatherproof. You will need them in the rain!

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Kundash. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Kundash~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Thank you for your work on the last Anti-Vandalism patrol.  Any help to revert damage is always appreciated, particularly when it can be so offensive.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:01, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

:Yep, thanks for the reversion of my talk page. Cheers. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:35, 17 December 2005 (UTC)


==A-Level Math C1==
Both these websites state some intergration is on the C1 exam.

Is there something that I'm missing? Did the exam change? [[User:Keytotime|Keytotime]] 19:47, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

Understood and will follow [[User:Keytotime|Keytotime]] 19:03, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Current environmental science major at san diego state university, i have always loved the idea of doing physical experiments. Possibly, i want to become a physics teacher in the future that can make students realize that physics is relevant and that their are many opportunities in science that students can and should realize.


----


Noticing a trend that not as many students are pursuing sciences and engineering in general, i want to make them realize that regardless of what they may become, science can and should be applied to life in general.

e-mail: compatta(at)yahoo.com 


== My interests include: ==
#-physics
#-Cognitive learning models of physics (educational technology)
#-Integrating fun things with the ever complext curriculum in schools.
#-the general &quot;tricks&quot; that students can use to learn algebra and math in general easier  to understand. Citing methods from around the world to figure out math (such as the mehtod to multiply extremely large numbers). Make complext areas of calculus that typically have the &quot;academic brow&quot; which tends to make cocnepts more complex than they should be.
#-Making texts in general more interesting for students. Not merely the study as my english teacher always said, &quot;the study of dead white men's work.&quot;



----

My heroes include:
#-Hewitt, the person who conveyed that complex ideas can be represented in simple explanations and diagrams.
#-stallman, open source father.
#writer of &quot;algebra for gansters&quot;</text>

Is it worth having some pictures/videos of how to grip sticks/beat the drum, etc? It always helps me to see it being done.  What's your thought?  I could do some basic picture taking/recording and then upload that. [[User:Kayvan.walker|Kayvan.walker]] 16:04, 6 August 2007 (UTC)

This is cool, I'll try to add to this page too, I think there should also be a section on playing different styles [Gio] 12/03/09

== musical notation ==

Isn't that difficult, using something like musescore, and exporting to SVG. Can we do that too?</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called InsayneWrapper. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name InsayneWrapper~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

   title=El Dedo|

   pronunciation=El dAY-do|
   summary=[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3yusJNVslo video (Media Noche)]. Right-to-right, follower turns right, left, leader turns right, [[Rueda de Casino/Enchufa|Enchufa]] then [[Rueda de Casino/Dile Que No|Dile Que No]].|
   related=[[Rueda de Casino/En Loji|En Loji]], [[Rueda de Casino/Montaña|Montaña]]
}}
&lt;noinclude&gt;
From [[Rueda de Casino/Guapea|Guapea]], instead of pushing, the leader changes to a right-to-right hold, and turns the follower to her right, then an [[Rueda de Casino/Enchufa|Enchufa]], still right-to-right.

He then turns himself to the left, turning his back on the follower, changing hands behind his back, so that he has left-to-right.
He then does an [[Rueda de Casino/Enchufa|Enchufa]] and [[Rueda de Casino/Dile Que No|Dile Que No]].

Throughout the first two turns, the leader is moving clockwise around the follower.

Hand Signal: Raise the little finger of the right hand.

There are some variations:

* Some leaders will keep right-to-right throughout, taking their right arm above their head.
* Some leaders will reach to the middle with their right hand, after changing to left-to-right, and all push away from each other in the middle.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

When using x86 assembly, it is important to consider the differences between architectures that are 16, 32, and 64 bits. This page will talk about some of the basic differences between architectures with different bit widths.

== The 8086 Registers ==

The 8086 registers are the following: AX, BX, CX, DX, BP, SP, DI, SI, CS, SS, ES, DS, IP and FLAGS. They are all 16 bits wide.

On any Windows-based system (except 64 bit versions), you can run a very handy program called &quot;debug.exe&quot; from a DOS shell, which is very useful for learning about 8086. If you are using DOSBox or FreeDOS, you can use &quot;debug.exe&quot; [http://www.freedos.org/software/?prog=debug as provided by FreeDOS.]

;AX, BX, CX, DX: These general purpose registers can also be addressed as 8-bit registers. So AX = AH (high 8-bit) and AL (low 8-bit).

;SI, DI: These registers are usually used as offsets into data space. By default, SI is offset from the DS data segment, DI is offset from the ES extra segment, but either or both of these can be overridden.

;SP: This is the stack pointer, offset usually from the stack segment SS. Data is pushed onto the stack for temporary storage, and popped off the stack when it is needed again.

;BP: The stack frame, usually treated as an offset from the stack segment SS. Parameters for subroutines are commonly pushed onto the stack when the subroutine is called, and BP is set to the value of SP when a subroutine starts. BP can then be used to find the parameters on the stack, no matter how much the stack is used in the meanwhile.

;CS, DS, ES, SS: The segment pointers. These are the offset in memory of the current code segment, data segment, extra segment, and stack segment respectively.

;IP: The instruction pointer. Offset from the code segment CS, this points at the instruction currently being executed.

;FLAGS (F): A number of single-bit flags that indicate (or sometimes set) the current status of the processor.

The original 8086 only had registers that were 16 bits in size, effectively allowing to store one value of the range [0 - (2^16 - 1)] (or simpler: it could address up to 65536 different bytes, or 64 Kilobytes) - but the address bus (the connection to the memory controller, which receives addresses, then loads the content from the given address, and returns the data back on the data bus to the CPU) was 20 bits in size, effectively allowing to address up to 1 Mebibyte of memory. That means that all registers by themselves were not large enough to make use of the entire width of the address bus. leaving 4 bits unused, scaling down the size of usable addresses by 16 (1024 Kilobytes / 64 Kilobytes = 16).

The problem was this: how can a 20-bit address space be referred to by the 16-bit registers? To solve this problem, the engineers of Intel came up with segment registers CS (Code Segment), DS (Data Segment), ES (Extra Segment), and SS (Stack Segment). To convert from 20-bit address, one would first divide it by 16 and place the quotient in the segment register and remainder in the offset register. This was represented as CS:IP (this means, CS is the segment and IP is the offset). Likewise, when an address is written SS:SP it means SS is the segment and SP is the offset.

This works also the reversed way. If one was, instead of convert from, to create a 20 bit address, it would be done by taking the 16-bit value of a segment register and put it on the address bus, but shifted 4 times to the left (thus effectively multiplying the register by 16), and then by adding the offset from another register untouched to the value on the bus, thus creating a full a 20-bit address.

=== Example ===

If CS = 0x258C and IP = 0x0012 (the &quot;0x&quot; prefix denotes hexadecimal notation), then CS:IP will point to a 20 bit address equivalent to &quot;CS * 16 + IP&quot; which will be = 0x258C * 0x10 + 0x0012 = 0x258C0 + 0x0012 = 0x258D2 (Remember: 16 decimal = 0x10). The 20-bit address is known as an absolute (or linear) address and the Segment:Offset representation (CS:IP) is known as a segmented address. This separation was necessary, as the register itself could not hold values that required more than 16 bits encoding. When programming in protected mode on a 32-bit or 64-bit processor, the registers are big enough to fill the address bus entirely, thus eliminating segmented addresses - only linear/logical addresses are generally used in this &quot;flat addressing&quot; mode, although the segment:offset architecture is still supported for backwards compatibility.

It is important to note that there is not a one-to-one mapping of physical addresses to segmented addresses; for any physical address, there is more than one possible segmented address.  For example: consider the segmented representations B000:8000 and B200:6000. Evaluated, they both map to physical address B8000 (B000:8000 = B000x10+8000 = B0000+8000 = B8000 and B200:6000 = B200x10+6000 = B2000+6000 = B8000). However, using an appropriate mapping scheme avoids this problem: such a map applies a linear transformation to the physical addresses to create precisely one segmented address for each.  To reverse the translation, the map [f(x)] is simply inverted.&lt;p&gt;

For example, if the segment portion is equal to the physical address divided by 0x10 and the offset is equal to the remainder, only one segmented address will be generated. (No offset will be greater than 0x0f.) Physical address B8000 maps to (B8000/10):(B8000%10) or B800:0. This segmented representation is given a special name: such addresses are said to be &quot;normalized Addresses&quot;.&lt;p&gt;

CS:IP (Code Segment: Instruction Pointer) represents the 20 bit address of the physical memory from where the next instruction for execution will be picked up. Likewise, SS:SP (Stack Segment: Stack Pointer) points to a 20 bit absolute address which will be treated as stack top (8086 uses this for pushing/popping values)

=== Protected Mode ===

As ugly as this may seem, it was in fact a step towards the protected addressing scheme used in later chips. The 80286 had a protected mode of operation, in which all 24 of its address lines were available, allowing for addressing of up to 16MB of memory. In protected mode, the CS, DS, ES, and SS registers were not segments but selectors, pointing into a table that provided information about the blocks of physical memory that the program was then using. In this mode, the pointer value CS:IP = 0x0010:2400 is used as follows:

The CS value 0x0010 is an offset into the selector table, pointing at a specific selector. This selector would have a 24-bit value to indicate the start of a memory block, a 16-bit value to indicate how long the block is, and flags to specify whether the block can be written, whether it is currently physically in memory, and other information. Let's say that the memory block pointed to actually starts at the 24-bit address 0x164400, the actual address referred to then is 0x164400 + 0x2400 = 0x166800. If the selector also includes information that the block is 0x2400 bytes long, the reference would be to the byte immediately following that block, which would cause an exception: the operating system should not allow a program to read memory that it does not own. And if the block is marked as read-only, which code segment memory should be so that programs don't overwrite themselves, an attempt to write to that address would similarly cause an exception.

With CS and IP being expanded to 32 bits in the 386, this scheme became unnecessary; with a selector pointing at physical address 0x00000000, a 32-bit register could address up to 4GB of memory. However, selectors are still used to protect memory from rogue programs. If a program in Windows tries to read or write memory that it doesn't own, for instance, it will violate the rules set by the selectors, triggering an exception, and Windows will shut it down with the &quot;General protection fault&quot; message.

=== 32-bit registers === 

With the chips beginning to support a 32-bit data bus, the registers needed to be updated to support the larger registers. The names for the 32-bit registers are simply the 16-bit names with an 'E' prepended.

;EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX : These are the 32-bit versions of the registers shown above.

=== 64-bit registers ===
The names of the 64-bit registers are the same of those of the 16-bit registers, except beginning with an 'R'.

;RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI, RBP, RSP : These are the 64-bit versions of the registers shown above.
;RIP: This is the full instruction pointer and should be used instead of EIP (which will be inaccurate if the address space is larger than 4 GiB, which may happen even with 4 GiB or less of RAM).

;R8~15 : These are new extra registers for 64-bit. They are counted as if the registers above are registers zero through seven, inclusively, rather than one through eight.

=== 128-bit registers ===
64-bit x86 includes [[X86 Assembly/SSE|SSE2]] (an extension to 32-bit x86), which provides 128-bit registers for specific instructions.

;XMM0~7 : SSE2 and newer.
;XMM8~15 : SSE3 and newer and AMD (but not Intel) SSE2.

Most CPUs made since 2008 also have AVX, a further extension that lengthens these registers to 256 bits.

== The A20 Gate Saga ==

As was said earlier, the 8086 processor had 20 address lines (from A0 to A19), so the total memory addressable by it was 1 MB (or &quot;2 to the power 20&quot;). But since it had only 16 bit registers, they came up with segment:offset scheme or else using a single 16-bit register they couldn't have possibly accessed more than 64 KB (or 2 to the power 16) of memory. So this made it possible for a program to access the whole of 1 MB of memory.

But with this segmentation scheme also came a side effect. Not only could your code refer to the whole of 1 MB with this scheme, but actually a little more than that. Let's see how...

Let's keep in mind how we convert from a Segment:Offset representation to Linear 20 bit representation.

The conversion:

    Segment:Offset = Segment x 16 + Offset

Now to see the maximum amount of memory that can be addressed, let's fill in both Segment and Offset to their maximum values and then convert that value to its 20-bit absolute physical address.

So, max value for Segment = FFFF
and max value for Offset  = FFFF

Now, let's convert FFFF:FFFF into its 20-bit linear address, bearing in mind 16 is represented as 10 in hexadecimal :-

So we get, FFFF:FFFF = FFFF x 10h + FFFF = FFFF0 + FFFF = FFFF0 + (FFF0 + F) = FFFFF + FFF0 = 1 MB + FFF0 

*Note: '''FFFFF is hexadecimal and is equal to 1 MB''' (one megabyte) and '''FFF0 is equal to 64 KB minus 16 bytes.'''


'''Moral of the story:''' From Real mode a program can actually refer to (1 MB + 64 KB - 16) bytes of memory.

Notice the use of the word &quot;refer&quot; and not &quot;access&quot;. Program can refer to this much memory but whether it can access it or not is dependent on the number of address lines actually present. So with the 8086 this was definitely not possible because when programs made references to 1 MB plus memory, the address that was put on the address lines was actually more than 20-bits, and this resulted in wrapping around of the addresses.

For example, if a code is referring to 1 MB, this will get wrapped around and point to location 0 in memory, likewise 1 MB + 1 will wrap around to address 1 (or 0000:0001).

Now there were some super funky programmers around that time who manipulated this feature in their code, that the addresses get wrapped around and made their code a little faster and a fewer bytes shorter. Using this technique it was possible for them to access 32 KB of top memory area (that is 32 KB touching 1 MB boundary) and 32 KB memory of the bottom memory area, without actually reloading their segment registers!

Simple maths you see, if in Segment:Offset representation you make Segment constant, then since Offset is a 16-bit value therefore you can roam around in a 64 KB (or 2 to the power 16) area of memory. Now if you make your segment register point to 32 KB below the 1 MB mark you can access 32 KB upwards to touch 1 MB boundary and then 32 KB further which will ultimately get wrapped to the bottom most 32 KB.

Now these super funky programmers overlooked the fact that processors with more address lines would be created. (Note: Bill Gates has been attributed with saying, &quot;Who would need more than 640 KB memory?&quot;, these programmers were probably thinking similarly). In 1982, just 2 years after 8086, Intel released the 80286 processor with 24 address lines. Though it was theoretically backward compatible with legacy 8086 programs, since it also supported Real Mode, many 8086 programs did not function correctly because they depended on out-of-bounds addresses getting wrapped around to lower memory segments. So for the sake of compatibility IBM engineers routed the A20 address line (8086 had lines A0 - A19) through the Keyboard controller and provided a mechanism to enable/disable the A20 compatibility mode. Now if you are wondering why the keyboard controller, the answer is that it had an unused pin. Since the 80286 would have been marketed as having complete compatibility with the 8086 (that wasn't even yet out very long), upgraded customers would be furious if the 80286 was not bug-for-bug compatible such that code designed for the 8086 would operate just as well on the 80286, but faster.

== 32-Bit Addressing ==

32-bit addresses can cover memory up to 4 GB in size. This means that we don't need to use offset addresses in 32-bit processors. Instead, we use what is called the &quot;Flat addressing&quot; scheme, where the address in the register directly points to a physical memory location. The segment registers are used to define different segments, so that programs don't try to execute the stack section, and they don't try to perform stack operations on the data section accidentally.

== Davs in formal conversation ==

I don't believe &quot;davs&quot; (&quot;hello&quot; ) is used formally – on the contrary it is a very informal greeting (but since spoken Danish is almost always very informal it doesn't actually matter very much). It is also falling out of use, and many young people would probably consider it archaic.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mjjohansen. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mjjohansen~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

:the book is certainly not finished.  Page numbers would be a good idea, but I am not sure if it is possible [[User:Juliusross|Juliusross]] 00:34, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

== thanks ==

is this book finished now? thanks to all for writing, but a quick note; i dont know if it can be fixed, but when i go print preview some of the math on the bottom of the pages is cut off and won't show up properly on print-out, could this be because of use of mozilla or??

== Major sections and page breaks ==

I started adding page breaks between major sections so that when the printed version is previewed or printed, sections that are logically separate are physically separated.  The highest level sections (e.g. Precalculus, Limits, Differentiation, etc) I have on their own page.  It looks pretty sparse currently.  What I envision is a page with the name of the major section (maybe in an artful font), maybe a graphic illustrating something relevant to the section, and maybe a brief introduction to the topics covered in that section.  Unfortunately I don't have time to implement that currently.  Maybe someone who has more time can work on it, or maybe if I get time later I can come back and work on it.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 16:50, 21 May 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Haiku? ==

In short, Haiku is an open-source re-creation of the operating system BeOS. In 1990, a company called [[Wikipedia:Be Incorporated|Be Incorporated]] was found in California, USA, by ex-Apple employees [[Wikipedia:Jean-Louis Gassée|Jean-Louis Gassée]] and [[Wikipedia:Steve Sakoman|Steve Sakoman]]. Be, Inc. had a vision: to create a powerful, elegant, media-oriented, and friendly computer with a matching operating system. They did create one. The computer was called the [[Wikipedia:BeBox|BeBox]], and it and its operating system, the [[Wikipedia:BeOS|BeOS]], were first presented at [[Wikipedia:Agenda 95|Agenda 95]] in October, 1995. It made the audience go wild.

The BeBox was ahead of its time in many ways. In the middle of the 1990s, it was unheard of that a consumer PC would have more than one CPU. The BeBox had two CPU's; originally AT&amp;T Hobbits, and from 1995 onwards PowerPC. The operating system, BeOS, had pervasive multithreading, pre-emptive multitasking, 64-bit journalling, database-like filesystem, very low latency in audio and video tasks, and a clean, slick user interface. It was, in a word, an operating system you could almost fall in love with.

Sadly, as things go, Be had to quit hardware due to financial and hardware supply problems, and they ported BeOS to PowerPC in 1997 and later, in 1998, to Intel compatible systems. Although the operating system had many enthusiastic users and developers, it never gained a significant market share. Lack of applications was one thing, as BeOS was developed from scratch and had only partial POSIX compatibility. In 2000, Be released the BeOS version 5.0, called the Personal Edition, for free (as in freeware) on the Internet &amp;ndash; which undermined the sales of the Pro edition, increasing Be's financial difficulties. The company shifted its focus to Internet appliances, which eroded the credibility of BeOS as a viable alternative to Windows or Linux. Be, Inc. went bankrupt in 2001.

Be left a legacy: a free of charge version of the BeOS. Although the operating system's future looked bleak, many still wanted to use it daily. From that want rose several projects to re-implement the BeOS experience in open source. Haiku is one of them.

Haiku is Japanese and means a short poem of a certain type. Originally, when the project was started in late 2001, it was called OpenBeOS; later, it was renamed Haiku. Haiku poems are simple and elegant, and that is what the Haiku Operating System also strives to be. The goal of Haiku is to be source and binary compatible to BeOS 5.0, and then extend it further to new areas. Because of the modularity of BeOS and because a free of charge, usable version was available, it was not an impossible task to start recreating the operating system.

At the time of writing this introduction (Dec 2005), Haiku has advanced slowly but steadily. The first working, alpha version seems to be just around the corner.

== Purpose of this book ==

What you are reading now is the Unofficial Haiku Handbook &amp;ndash; a user manual. This book will guide you in installing and using Haiku, configuring it, installing software, connecting to other computers, playing media files, and managing your files efficiently. Although it is written more from the beginner's perspective, many old, advanced BeOS users will no doubt find useful hints. Haiku R1 is very similar to BeOS 5.0.

FIXME: Add description of chapters once the table of contents has been fixed.

== Differentiation is NOT in C1 ==

Sorry to all you guys that have put this here, but I have just checked the OCR syllabus, there is no mention of Differentiation at all.

It's deff in the Edexcel syllabus...

--
It's DEFINITELY in the OCR syllabus. We just did about 2 weeks of it and it's in my OCR book. [[Special:Contributions/82.20.215.203|82.20.215.203]] ([[User talk:82.20.215.203|talk]]) 17:37, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

== From Talk:A-level Mathematics/C2/Differentiation ==

Hi, I've just added quite a bit on differentiation.  It could probably do with some editing and probably re-writing.  This is my first real addition to wikibooks so sorry if it isn't that good ^^.
Anyway, there is still more that is required based...However it appears in C1 I believe, not C2, so perhaps someone could move this page unless I am mistaken.  I was also wondering...would it be possible to add multiple index pages so that this book could cover multiple syllabuses, since that basic differentiation is also what I did on AQA for P1 as I recall. Anyway, hope what I put is at least some use as a foundation, bye for now. [[User:Robb3h|Robb3h]] 19:10, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

No problems, im fairly new to wikibooks myself. I just checked my textbook and it appears in chapter 8 under a C2 tab, i had previously moved it from C1 to here. I thought the textbook I have covers all examining bodies. P1 is a mix of C1 and C2. The alternative index pages seem like a good idea, that only leaves the question of which index page will be the main one. [[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 13:45 29 July 2005

I'm in the second year of my OCR Maths A-level, and last year differentiation was definitely C1 (and still is, I hasten to add). I don't want to move anything without some consensus, but it would seem it should be under C1... [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 00:48, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

Differentiation definately under C1 - doing AS and covered it very recently. However I think there is more differentiation under C2 - perhaps a seperate topic for that.

:Take a look at my [[User_talk:Krackpipe#A-level_Mathematics|talk page]], this issue has been resolved, and differentiation is in fact in C1. I moved it by accident because I confused two different, but similarly named, specifications from the same examining group.--[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 19:49, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

== Related Rates ==

The solution to the moving ladder problem uses implicit differentiation (not covered until C4?) and seems too complicated for C1. I can't see a way to solve this problem using only C1 differentiation, so perhaps it should be changed/removed. [[User:Aleksev|Aleksev]] 18:18, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

This still needs  a LOT of work.  There is absolutly NO explanation of what exactly a derivative ''is''.  The module jumps right to the power rule, bypassing the basis of derivatives, which are really the '''limit of a secant line.'''  Pictures wouldn't hurt either.--[[User:Crucible Guardian|Crucible Guardian]] 21:09, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== A Suggestion ==

I am not familiar with A-Level Mathematics, so of course, I cannot do this myself.  However, it would be nice if a proof for the different rules was shown alongside the rules, unless they are postulates.  Which I assume they cannot be.

== bath tub example. ==

i think the bath tub example is probably a bad one. the maths is sound, but the example is confusing because a bath would never fill at such a rate. unless you have very odd plumbing the bath will almost certainly fill at a constant rate. something like the acceleration of a car makes much more sense and would be easier to understand.

Good Idea Fixed. [[User:Keytotime|Keytotime]] 18:09, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

== Differentiation IS in C1 ==

look at page 8 in the spec 
[http://www.ocr.org.uk/Data/publications/key_documents/AS_A_Level86696.pdf]



== Afraid not... ==
Look at the date on that spec. I'm doing C1 / 2 now and I know for a fact that C1 has been done and dusted for a month and only now are we doing Differentiation. It is in C2</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Once upon a time, their were two types of people. The people of toaster town and the people of Glove town.
Every so while, a person from each town would observe each others differences, perhaps wanting to move to
live a lifestyle which is good for them. People from toaster town observed that people in glove town typically &quot;had no energy.&quot; The people of the town were very slow moving and conservative. They tended to resist the advances in Toaster town because they thought &quot;Energy will destroy the very meaning of our life.&quot; Thus, they enacted the &quot;no moving electrons&quot; law and thus all the people in the town stayed at home, preferring to abundantly stare at the wall.

Similarly, the people from Glove town observed that people in Toaster town tended to have &quot;lots of energy.&quot; Being liberal, they embraced the concept of &quot;energy&quot; and typically have places called &quot;Energy bucks&quot; to give them energy to live their fast placed life. Everybody tended to walk very fast and seemed to work as delivery people, giving &quot;current&quot; to others and living their own happy lives.

&lt;math&gt;Ohms Law: R = E/I&lt;/math&gt;
*(higher) resistances, (Less) current
*(lower) resistances, (higher) current

Similarly, the people of both the towns are there to represent a key point in electrical circuits: Ohm Law. What basically Ohms law says is that if the resistance is higher, than the current will be lower. Conversely, if resistance is lower, than the current will be higher. As you you can see, there are generally two types (in actuality there are more, but for the sake of learning) Inductors and conductors. Inductors, as represented as &quot;glove&quot; town, tend to have very high resistances and don't tend to pass too much electrons from one point to another. Conductors, as represented as &quot;Toaster&quot; town, tend to have lower resistances and pass electrons of current easier easier.


Atomic Representation of Inductors.

(ex) Heavy metal Concerts: no passes

Inductors are basically molecular &quot;bouncers&quot; that don't tend to accept electrons from one point to another.

Atomic Represenation of COnductotors.

(ex)Heavy Metal Concerts: with passes

Conductors are like the young, rich, electrons that pass freely through the metal gates and thus enjoy the concert freely.

Just in case you didn't know:
Don't touch the inside of your computer without touching metal!!


The most apparent form of electricity for a majority of mankind has been this force called &quot;static electricity.&quot; As young children, we used have fun and rub our feet over the carpet and thus shock our friends which this intense shock (though, not enough to harm you). As you have grown older, likely you would have gotten this shock when touching your car door. Here is an experiment in which you want to consider.

FEET (hippy like conductors)
Try this experiment with no shoes and rub your feet across a carpeted area. Feel the shock!

Shoes (for conservative inductors)

Try this experiment with rubber boots. Now, rub your feet across the carpeted and feel....well nothing.

== Incredibly verbose, does not get to the point ==
I am new to Blender and this wall of text provides so much of a challenge to get past I cannot get past it. Really, a n00b does not need to know everything that is happening. Just show with just the text needed in incremental steps how the process is done. As it stands now it is more confusing than anything. I don't even know where to start from a reference point of view either.

== Can I write this chapter ==
Does anyone mind if I write this chapter? If not where can I put screen shots.
After watching the Video I had a better idea of how to do UV Mapping but I still had a hard time unwraping a simple box. I imagine that other noobs like me would have the same problem so I just wanted to write a small one that shows how to map a box.

:::Yes.  For technical reasons related to 'homogeneous coordinates' you need four numbers to describe a 3D vertex.  Hence, 3D graphics people use X,Y,Z and W for 3D coordinates.  In the early days of texture mapping, U and V were the logical choice because they are the immediately previous letters in the alphabet before W.  However, blender is a bit behind the times because with modern hardware you can have 3D textures - which means you need another letter (and with 'homogeneous texture coordinates', two more letters).  In modern shader languages (Cg, GLSL, HLSL) S,T,P and Q are used for texture coordinates (R is not used because it gets confused with the 'R' in RGBA.  Hence, the 'modern' nomenclature ought to be 'ST' or 'STP' mapping...but many engineers and almost all artists still talk about &quot;UV mapping&quot; out of habit.

As a new user to Blender, I have been using 2.45 up until quite recently. Perhaps a mention of what to expect? From 2.45 to 2.48a.

== Rectangular UV Map ==
You can also use a normal rectangular pic of the earth and unwrap it. I started with a satellite image of the earth from maps.google.com, without labels. I opened it in the UV Image editor, and unwrapped. Then I took the two polygons and moved some of the pixels, pushing them into the center and into the corners to fill completely the rectangular picture. This wraps and renders quite nicely, with a bit of fiddling of the pixels, and happens to be better than the supplied images in this tutorial which are not complete halves of the earth, but approximately thirds, so are missing most of the southern hemisphere. You can also photoshop the rectangular image and remove the Google text so it doesn't show up on your rendered earth.

== Page Layout ==

With Blender 2.49b being standard and 2.5x nearing completion, shouldn't the &quot;2.49b&quot; section be moved to the top and renamed, followed by sections dealing with versions prior to the 2.49b release?

I agree. At the risk of complication and server space it might even be worthwhile to have two chapters addressing the same subject.  The first should have a title making it clear it is for versions before 2.45.  The other's title should explicitly say it is for version 2.49 (and later).  I have 2.49.  The video on UV mapping is very well presented and everything works logically with great facility.  Unfortunately, in my case, the commands no longer are in version 2.49.[[User:WindsorSpring|WindsorSpring]] ([[User talk:WindsorSpring|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/WindsorSpring|contribs]]) 15:20, 20 February 2011 (UTC)

== wraparound to use the whole picture ==

In the alternative method, one does not want the UVs to go out of bounds vertically. 
However, it is actually desirable to go out of bounds horizontally and wrap around, specifically to have as much out of bounds on the left at each vertical position as the mesh falls short on the right, and vice versa. That way the whole map is used.
The mistake is evident in the final screenshot in the fact that Russia crashes so completely into Alaska, because the edges simply aren't used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
The original browser of choice among Mac OS X users was Microsoft's Internet Explorer for Mac. However, after Internet Explorer rose to dominate the market, Microsoft grew complacent and stopped updating it. By 2002, Internet Explorer was no longer a modern browser, and Apple began work on its own web browser to replace it. 

In January of 2003, Apple's CEO Steve Jobs announced Safari, an all-new, Apple-designed web browser that was designed to replace Internet Explorer for Mac.

Since then, Safari has evolved into a browser to be reckoned with - with the greatest standards compliance of any browser (Mac or Windows), fast performance, and a crop of advanced features like tabbed browsing, RSS, and AutoFill. It's the third most popular browser in the world and the single most popular browser available for Mac OS X.


{{Info|'''NOTE:''' Just as this wikibook assumes moderate computer experience, this chapter assumes you're a proficient internet user. If none of these words mean anything to you, seek out a book on the web for beginners: link, form, account, inbox, address, and Google.}}

=The Safari Interface=
This section looks at Safari's interface and explains how to use it to browse the web. &lt;font style=&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: FFFF66&quot;&gt;Safari is unique in that it actually has ''two'' toolbars (called the &quot;Address Bar&quot; and the &quot;Bookmarks Bar&quot;).&lt;/font&gt; Both can be toggled on and off independantly in the View menu. In addition, you can use the view menu to opt for a &quot;status bar&quot; to appear along the bottom of the window. This bar will display page loading progress and will tell you where links lead to if you roll your cursor over them.

Note that there's a third toolbar in Safari, called the &quot;Tab Bar&quot;. You'll use it only if you turn on tabbed browsing, which is discussed later on in this chapter.

==The Address Bar==
This brushed metal toolbar houses all of Safari's basic web browsing controls. Like most toolbars in Mac OS X, the Address Bar is totally customizable. The default, factory-fresh toolbar has the following buttons and fields on it:

*Back/Forward - These two conjoined buttons let you go back to the previous page you viewed, or reverse the action of pressing the back button and return to the page you went back from.
*Stop/Reload - These two Web Browsing mainstays have been combined into one button: when a page is loading, this button halts the page-loading process. When Safari isn't loading anything, the button '''re'''loads the current page, in case it changed since you last loaded it or didn't load properly the first time around.{{Info|'''NOTE:''' Many other browsers refer to the reload button as &quot;Refresh&quot;, so if a website tells you to refresh the page, reload instead.}}
*Add Bookmark - This essential button, marked with a plus sign, lets you add the page you're looking at to your bookmark collection. Bookmarks are covered later on in this sub-chapter, along with exactly how this button works.
*Address and Search - These two text fields are probably the most important items in the Address Bar, and browsing without them would be very difficult indeed. The Address Field lets you type a web address (aka &quot;URL&quot;), and one press of the Return key later, takes you directly to it. It even doubles as a progress bar, filling up with a blue color as a page loads. The Search field, which is pill-shaped and marked with a magnifying glass, lets you perform a Google Web search right from your Safari toolbar. Clicking the tiny arrow next to the magnifying glass lets you review searches you have previously made.{{Mac Trick Box|You can proportion the two text fields by dragging the small dot between them.}}{{Yellow_Warning|'''WARNING:''' Don't confuse the Address Bar and the Address Field! The Address Bar is the entire toolbar that the Address Field resides in, along with the other items described here.}}


If you want to, you can add other buttons to the toolbar to help improve your web-browsing experience. You know the toolbar customization drill: right-click the toolbar and choose &quot;Customize Toolbar&quot;.

The other buttons availible are:
*Home - Safari lets you set a &quot;Home Page&quot;, which is the first page you'll see when you open Safari. This button takes you there.

*AutoFill - AutoFill, a supremely useful Safari feature, is covered later on in this sub-chapter.

*Print - The print button does the same thing as the File &gt; Print command or the ⌘P keystroke: it opens the standard Mac OS X print box and offers to print a hard copy of a web page for you.

*Report Bug - These days, Safari's standards compliance is legendary. It was the first broswer ever to pass the &quot;Acid2&quot; test, a modern benchmark for browser compatibility. But back in the day, when Safari was still in beta (geek-speak for &quot;released for testing&quot;) and Apple was just learning the ropes, the Report Bug button let Safari users complain to Apple about websites that didn't work correctly. It still works today, in case you find a site that disagrees with Safari.

==The Bookmarks Bar==
The thin metal strip of words under the Address Bar is the Bookmarks Bar. It's discussed in the Bookmarks section of this sub-chapter.

=Browsing Around=
==Setting a Home Page==

==Downloading Files==
==Blocking Pop-Ups==
==Saving and eMailing==
==PDF Files==
==Spell Checking==
Safari, like most applications that use Apple's standard Programming API, has access to OS X's built-in spell check service. It can be used several ways. The first, and easiest to use way, is to have OS X check spelling as you type. This method can be activated by first clicking in any web page's entry field, then going to Edit &gt; Spelling then select 'Check Spelling as You Type.' This feature will then underline misspelled words in red and allow you to correct the word from its suggestions by Control-Clicking (Right-clicking with a two-button mouse) the word. If you know you spelled the word right you can have OS X add it to the spelling dictionary by selecting 'Learn Spelling' from the Control-Click menu. This setting may only be active for that session of Safari but once activated only the red underlining may go away on relaunch. Spelling options will still be a Control-Click/Right-click away and easily re-enabled.

Alternatively you can check the spelling of an entire text area by pressing ⌘; or by using the Edit&gt;Spelling&gt;Check Spelling menu command. If you only want to check one word using this method simply select the word you wish to check and then pressing ⌘; or use Edit&gt;Spelling&gt;Check Spelling. Preferences for how spelling is checked can be changed, including what dictionary to use, by using the Edit&gt;Spelling&gt;Spelling… menu command.

Note spell checking will not pick up Roman numerals. (try to spell check cdcdc ). Spell checking must also be enabled per application even though it is a shared program (so [[Mac OS X Tiger/Meet the Applications/TextEdit]], [[Mac OS X Tiger/Meet the Applications/Mail]], and others need their own enabling of spell check.

If a spelling error is added it is put in a file at '~/Library/Spelling/en' if the entry is in English. There is syntax in the file so be wary editing it.

=Bookmarks and History=
As you browse the web, you may find it convenient to keep certain web addresses handy for easy access. Safari includes many places to keep these stored addresses, called bookmarks.

The first place is the Bookmarks Bar. This brushed-metal strip directly below the Address Bar is something like a Dock for bookmarks: it keeps your ''very'' favorite websites within easy reach. To add a bookmark to this bar, navigate to the page you want to add. Click on the &quot;Add Bookmark&quot; button in the Address Bar, type a short name for the bookmark, and choose &quot;Bookmarks Bar&quot; from the pop-up menu. Then click &quot;OK&quot;. 

The bookmark now appears directly in the Bookmarks Bar. You can now visit the site you bookmarked simply by clicking the name that you chose.


{{Mac Trick Box|You can reorder bookmarks in the Bookmarks Bar by dragging them horizontally.}}


If the Bookmarks Bar fills up, an &gt;&gt; icon appears at the end. Clicking this shows a menu that contains all the bookmarks that didn't fit. However, this is hardly an ideal solution. For bookmarks that you use semi-frequently but do not want on your Bookmarks Bar, you can use the Bookmarks Menu instead.

This menu works just like the Bookmarks Bar. To add a page, navigate to the page you want to add, click on the &quot;Add Bookmark&quot; button, type a name, but this time choose &quot;Bookmarks Menu&quot; from the pop-up menu. Then click &quot;OK&quot;. The page now appears in the Bookmarks menu.

==Bookmarks Manager==
===Folders===
Once you start accumulating bookmarks, you'll want to organize them into folders. To do this, you'll use a part of Safari called the Bookmarks Manager. You can get to the Bookmarks Manager by clicking the little book icon in the left side of the Bookmarks Bar. The website you were viewing will be temporarily covered up by the Bookmarks Manager. This screen lets you organize your bookmarks and delete ones you don't want anymore.

The sidebar on the left contains collections of bookmarks. You'll notice that two of these collections are named Bookmarks Bar and Bookmarks Menu. These contain the bookmarks that appear in the Bookmarks Bar and Bookmarks Menu. Click one of these in the sidebar, and the contents pane to the right will display the bookmarks inside.

Let's say you want to add a folder inside the Bookmarks Menu collection. To do this, click the ''second plus button from the left'' at the bottom of the screen. The folder appears in the contents pane, ready to be named. Once you have finished typing a name, press the return key. You can then put the bookmarks inside the folder by dragging them onto the folder's icon. Folders like these are great for grouping websites with similar subjects; you could create a folder called &quot;Macintosh&quot; that contains all of your Mac-related websites. 

Folders appear in the Bookmarks Bar as pop-up menus, and in the Bookmarks Menu as sub-menus. 

If you want to delete a bookmark or folder of bookmarks, find it in the Bookmarks Manager, select it in the contents pane and pressing the delete key on your keyboard.

===Collections===
There are some other collections in the sidebar besides &quot;Bookmarks Bar&quot; and &quot;Bookmarks Manager&quot;. These contain bookmarks that appear in neither the Bookmarks Bar nor the Bookmarks Menu. You actually have to open the Bookmarks Manager and double-click on them when you want to access the site they point to. This is rather inconvenient, so these folders are for bookmarks that you use infrequently. 

You can create a collection with the '''plus button at the the far left'''. Apple gives you a bunch of these collections already stocked with bookmarks to help you discover some websites. But if you don't want them gunking up your sidebar, you can delete them by clicking on their name and pressing the delete key on your keyboard.

{{Mac Trick Box|You can do a Spotlight search for your bookmarks with the search field at the bottom of the Bookmarks Manager.}}

===History===
=Tabbed Browsing=
==Basics==
Tabbed Browsing is a productivity feature in Safari that lets you view multiple web pages in the same window. It vastly streamlines the browsing experience, and it's a great idea to learn how to use it.

The first thing you have to do is turn Tabbed Browsing on. To do this, you'll need to visit Safari Preferences. Just like every other application, Safari's preferences can found in the application menu, or can be accessed by pressing ⌘-comma.  Once you're inside Safari Preferences, click on &quot;Tabs&quot;. The pane that appears contains three checkboxes. The top one is the one you're looking for; the master switch that turns on Tabbed Browsing. However, don't expect anything magical to happen when you check the box. You can now close Safari Preferences.

The magic happens when you create a tab. To do this, press ⌘T. A few things happen. First of all, the third toolbar mentioned at the beginning of this sub-chapter magically appears below the Bookmarks Bar. This is called the Tab Bar. You'll notice it contains two tabs. Try clicking them and watch what happens. One of the tabs contains the web page you were just viewing; the other one is the one you just created, which is blank.

Each tab is now a totally separate entity. You can browse the web in one tab, then click on the other and find it totally undisturbed. If you're in the middle of editing a Wikibook and want to quickly check on Mac news, you can create a second tab for the Mac news site, browse around a bit, and then go right back to your Wikibook editing. Depending on how you browse the web, you might find it convenient to open three, four, or even ten tabs at the same time.

You can close any tab by clicking on the little &quot;X&quot; button inside it.

==Tips and Tricks==
A few tabbed browsing pointers:
*You can opt to have the tab bar displayed even with only one site open by checking &quot;Always show tab bar&quot; in the Tabs pane of Safari Preferences.
*You can still open multiple windows when tabbed browsing is turned on. Each window can have a different set of tabs inside.
*The keyboard shortcuts used for tabbed browsing change depending on settings. Check the Tabs pane of Safari Preferences for a list of keyboard shorcuts that apply to your current settings.

=RSS=
RSS stands for &quot;Really Simple Syndication&quot;. It's an emerging web standard that lets website creators make special pages for their websites called &quot;feeds&quot;. Feeds have no visuals or layout; they simply provide a list of links with descriptions. It's up to an RSS reader application like Safari to display the links in a feed in a visually appealing way.

Feeds are taking the web by a storm, and you're lucky to have Safari; its RSS functionality is often considered the best of any browser. As you will see if you read this section, there are many unique uses for feeds.

==Finding a Feed==
Finding a feed is pretty easy. Start by hopping on over to [http://www.apple.com apple.com]. 

{{Mac Note Box|Remember to hold down ⌘ as you click the link. Doing so will cause it to open in a new window or new tab (depending on settings), so you can continue to read this wikibook while trying out the feed.}}

This is the beginning point for what will become a '''Contradancers Guide to Successfully Beginning Scottish Country Dance'''.  For now, I'm going to throw in a big disorganized mass of text, and hope that I can get some help in putting the thing together in a way that will be coherent and usable.

It should be noted that, while the main audience for this text are experienced contradancers, the text should be useful to other beginners at SCD.  


== Introduction ==

Contradance (Contra) and Scottish Country Dance (SCD) are related forms who trace their histories through English Country Dance (ECD).  Contra derives from localized variants of ECD in the Eastern United States from the time of English colonization that were revived with the popularization of folk music in the 1960s and have been adapted, modified and expanded over the decades since.  SCD was  known as “English Country Dance as Danced in Scotland” until the Second World War. 

From these similar origins, some substantial differences have developed.  Contra is a relatively relaxed and open form. Contra is done to a walking step, while SCD is done with a number of precisely defined and executed steps.  In SCD, there is a strong connection between the specific dances and the music they are danced to, while most Contra dances have no particular association to given pieces of music.  Minimum competency can be achieved in Contra with a short workshop before a dance, and intermediate status can be achieved after a few nights of dancing.  In SCD, minimum competency comes after a month or more of weekly classes, and intermediate status takes six months to a year of weekly classes to achieve.  

This last part is very important for the contradancer attempting to learn SCD to keep in mind – it is going to take a lot longer to know what you're doing with SCD than it did to learn Contra.  While you are struggling to learn footwork, pas-de-basque and how to tie them together into figures and formations, you will be finding others with more experience who seem to be doing all of those things with little thought or effort.  If you are patient with yourself and patient with others during your months of steep learning curve, you will find that you will soon be doing those things with as little thought and effort as the others, and that you're having quite a good time.  You will also find rather quickly that your Contra experience gives you a leg up on the beginner with no background in country dance.  

You may also find that you have developed a number of bad habits in Contra that SCD will make painfully obvious (and painful).  Correcting those habits will improve your Contra experience (and the experience of those you dance with as well).  

==Is SCD for you?==

It's not for everybody, not even every contradancer.  The only way to know for sure is to show up and try some classes and talk to your instructor about whether you're picking it up or not.  However, the following might give you an idea if you're apt to find this a good fit.

# Do you count the bars while dancing contra?
# Do you enjoy proper dances?
# Do you enjoy dances done in three and four couple sets, rather than long-line sets?
# Do you like dancing with people who try to dance their figures correctly and on the correct count?
# Would you enjoy Contra a bit more if it was a bit more formal or elegant sometimes?
# Do you like being around people in traditional Scottish dress on occasion?
# Do you have an affinity for traditional Scottish things?


== Helpful Hints ==

=== 1.  Commit to giving SCD a fair try ===


This is an important principle in Contra as well, as you've likely noticed beginners that show up after the beginner's workshop, stick with their beginner friends, never quite seem to get the hang of any of the dances, and leave (perhaps early) that night and never come back.  This is an even larger issue in SCD, where the learning curve is much steeper and longer than that of Contra.  A fair try in Contra would be two or three dances, to take into account differences in callers, partners, and bands, any of which could be a tough fit for the beginner.  A fair try in SCD would be three to six months of weekly classes and as many evenings of dancing as occur.  This will give you time to learn enough of the basics well enough that you can begin to get the sense of a dance so that you can not only remember the figure you're doing right this second, but also remember the next figure that's coming and how to flow from the one to the other.  The first time this happens is a rather magic moment, and, until you've experienced it, you won't really understand what SCD is all about.  Having (hopefully) reached this point with Contra already, you can appreciate this all the more when it happens in SCD.

=== 2.  Get involved with the classes ===

This is very different from Contra, and is worthy of a lot of emphasis.  SCD requires classes -- only the very most talented dancers will be able to pick up a minimal understanding of SCD from attending dances, and it will take them a period of years to get to that point.  By far the best way is to attend classes where you can be taught the basic steps, figures, some dances and etiquette.  

=== 3.  Come to the dances. ===


This should be less of a problem with Contradancers than with beginners that don't have a background in dance, because the dances are all there is to Contra.  However, many beginners think that they aren't good enough dancers to come to a dance, and this is just wrong.  The dance floor is a large space, and a good dance program should have a number of easy, beginner-friendly dances on it.  Come to the dance and you will get to meet and dance with dancers that don't attend your classes.  Dances are a very valuable place to learn what dancing is all about and how it works.  You will doubtless hear many times that SCD is social dance, and the place where SCD is social is at the dances.  There is an etiquette to learn that will make what you see done at dances make more sense.

== Before your first class ==


Before you show up for a class, it's not a bad idea to consider buying a good pair of dancing shoes (if you don't already have one).  Most male SCDers will be wearing ghillies or jazz shoes, and female SCDers will wear either of those or ballet shoes (not toe-shoes).  The soft-soles these have are easier on the floors you are dancing on, and will give you a better balance between sticking to the floor and sliding than most street-shoes.  Over time, maintaining traction on these shoe surfaces will be an issue, and you can get tips from experienced dancers on how to address it.

It's also not a bad idea to make contact with the instructor of the beginners class to verify the time and place information you've got, to introduce yourself, and to begin to get a feel for how the instructor operates.  They can also let you know about the local dance opportunities, the cost of the class, etc.  Ask about how beginner-tolerant the intermediate or experienced dance class is.


== At your first class ==


It's a good idea to show up a little early at your first class.  This will give you time to change into your dancing shoes, meet the instructor, and maybe chat with some of the other dancers.  You can also get a good warm-up prior to the class if you'd like.  

Something you should know by now is that dancing with beginners is very hard.  Learning SCD in an all-beginner environment is tricky because you not only need to learn how to dance your part --  you also need to learn enough of what your partner is to do that you can help prompt your partner from time to time.  This is an reason why going to dances is important while you're learning -- you will be able to dance with more dancers with more experience at the dances than you will in a beginners class.

==Things your teachers will teach you in class==

Yes, these are things your teachers will teach you, but you might find that the additional modality of reading will help you understand what they're saying.  
===Hands===
There are some phrases and words used in SCD that have specialized meaning.  For example, you will be told that any time you take hands in a figure, you should use a “hand-shake hold”.  This does not mean the same grip that two American businessmen would use in a meeting, and trying to use that grip will lead to confusion and awkward dancing.  “Hand-shake hold” means a hold where the gripping is done with the fingers and thumb, and what is held is the fingers – the palm of the hand is not involved.  This is usually done with the gentleman holding his hand out with his fingers horizontal, and the lady placing her hand on top of his.

When taking hands on the side of the dance, there are a number of systems as to how this should be done.  One is that, if there is an odd number of folks taking hands, the person in the middle will keep their palms up, with those on each side putting their palms down.  Another is that hands should be held with the left palm down and the right palm up so that everybody has their thumbs pointing to the right.  Clearly, these two systems are mutually exclusive, and adherents to either system, on the very rare occasion the subject comes up for open conversation between experienced dancers will result in disagreement about which method is proper.  In practice, the system that seems to happen the most is that hands are put out for gripping purposes without being looked at.  If the hands are lined up for an easy grip, that grip is taken.  If not, one or both parties will quickly switch their hand position until a grip can be taken.  In time, as you become familiar with the people you are dancing with (and, most of the time, you will be dancing with the same group of people), you can learn who takes which approach, if they have one, and adjust accordingly.

===Feet===
====Positions====
SCD uses foot positions taken from ballet.  For those not familiar with them, this guide might be helpful:

*'''First position''' is with the heels together, toes apart, so the feet form a right angle.

*'''Second position''' is like first position, but with the feet one step apart (heels more or less under the shoulders).

*'''Third position''' has the heel of the front foot resting in the instep of the other foot, forming a T.

*'''Fourth position''' is similar to third, only, again, the front foot is about a step further from the other foot, but the feet still form a right angle.

For all of these positions, even while resting, the weight should be on the balls of the feet and the toes, not the heels.  Having the heels off of the ground is a good thing.  

====Traveling Steps====

When dancing to a jig or a reel, the traveling step will be the '''skip change of step''' usually referred to as &quot;skip-change.&quot;  Skip-change begins from first position with the right foot going forward into fourth position, the left foot closing into third position, and the right food going forward again to fourth position, then the left foot moving forward into fourth, the right closing into third, and the left returning to fourth, then repeating with the right foot going back into fourth.  Once through this pattern takes two bars of music, with the right foot going forward on all odd-numbered bars, and the left foot going forward on all even-numbered bars.

When dancing the slower '''strathspey''' (which all instructors should tell you is unique to SCD), the step is actually similar in terms of what has been described here -- it starts in first position, the right foot goes forward to fourth, the left closes into third, etc.  However, this is done more slowly (as the music is more slow), the weight remains on the back foot in strathspey (it is on the front foot in skip-change), and there is a small hop as you switch from having the right foot forward in fourth to the left foot forward in fourth (and vice versa) to allow the back foot to go forward.  Those who have seen or done Irish Step Dance may want to lift their knees up during the hop, but this should be resisted willfully.  SCD tends to prefer straight legs as much as possible.  Also, on the first step, since the weight is on the back foot, the front leg stretches into fourth while the back knee bends, ready to spring straight for the push to move the weight to the front foot when it's time to close to third.  

Both steps are easier to do than these descriptions make them sound.  They can be about as difficult to learn as these descriptions indicate, so, if you're not getting them the first time you try them, don't be discouraged.  While you're dancing, watch others feet, not your own, and you'll find that you'll soon be doing them correctly.  

For circling, and a few other figures, we use '''slip step''' in which you start in first position, extend the left (or right) foot into second position, then bring the right (or left) foot to close back into first position.  Two of these open-close combinations go into one bar of music, rather than two bars for each right-left combinations in the other steps, so &quot;two bars of slip step&quot; is actually four slip step steps.  Beginners rarely have trouble learning slip step.

If you're ever too tired to do these steps properly, or if your legs or knees aren't up to the strain, a prompt walking step can cover the same ground in the same time.  

====Setting Steps====

Setting steps keep your feet and body moving without moving you across the floor very much or at all.  
=====Pas de basque=====
In jigs and reels, the setting step is the '''pas de basque''', which, for as common a step as it is, can be quite tricky to learn -- many experienced dancers do not do the pas de basque in a manner close to what is described here or in the instructions from the RSCDS.  This is a matter to apply as much patience as you need to.

The pas de basque begins (usually) in first position by moving the right foot into second position, then moving the left foot in front into third position, then raising up on the left foot for a beat, lowering to the right foot for a beat, then moving the left foot into second position, bringing the right foot in front into third position, raising up on the right foot for a beat, lowering to the left foot for a beat, then repeating.  This right-then-left combination will take two bars of music, and should have a definite movement of the body to the right and then left, and also a definite change of weight on the parts where you are raising up on the front foot that's in third position.  

The right-to-left movement should center on the place where you're dancing, so that your net movement is no movement at all.  

=====Strathspey=====

The setting set in strathspey time is much easier to learn and do than pas de basque.  It begins from first position, stepping the right foot into second position, closing into third position ''behind the right'' with the left, then stepping into second again with the right and bringing the left foot up to the side of the right leg during the hop, then returning the left foot to second, stepping into third ''behind with the right'', the back into second with the left and bringing the right foot up to the side of the left leg during the hop.  

=====Highland Schottishe Setting=====
This is a rather tricky variant of the strathspey setting step where you raise your right hand and bend your elbow so that your hand is above your head while you hop on your left foot once while moving your right foot out to second position, hop on your left again while bringing your right foot up behind your left leg (so the foot is in line with the leg, toes down), hop on your left again while bringing your right foot back out to second, hop on your left again while bringing your right foot up in front of your left leg (again, so the foot is in line with the leg, does down), then bringing your hand down and doing the rightward-moving portion of the strathspey setting step.  Half-way done now.  Then you reverse the process, putting your left hand above your head, and hopping once on the right while bringing your left foot out into second, hopping again on the right whle bringing your left foot behind the right leg, hopping again on the right while bringing your left foot into second again, hopping yet once more while bringing your left foot up in front of your right leg, and then dropping your hand while doing the leftward portion of the strathspey setting step.  

This means that one time-through of Highland Schottishe Setting will take four bars of music.  

If your instructor has you trying this before you've been in class for a year, it is okay to give them a suspicious or accusing look.  

====Petronella====

Petronella is actually a figure, but, since it's a close variant of setting, it's usually presented with setting, so it's being presented here with setting.  This does not refer to the petronella turn you learned in Contra -- they're derived from the same figure, but you'll need to do each a while to see how they're related. 

A petronella is done just like a regular pas de basque or strathspey setting step, with the same foot-to-beat pattern going on as the setting step, only it begins with the right foot going forward into fourth position rather than second position, the weight-shift portions accompanied by a pulling-back of the right shoulder, then the left foot going back into fourth position behind, continuing the pulling-back of the right shoulder such that, when you've finished, you're now half-way across the dance, facing to the left of where you started the petronella.  If repeated (which it often is) from that ending position, the second petronella will put you on the side opposite where you started.

== At your first dance ==

Your first dance can be a rather scary thing.  It's very easy to psych yourself out because you don't think you're good enough to go around experienced dancers.  However, most experienced dancers are happy to see new faces and will offer support and encouragement to new dancers.  

Your dance program should be available well ahead of time, and should include a mix of easier dances and more challenging dances, and those difficulty levels should be indicated in some fashion on the dance program.  It is a good idea to look the program over ahead of time with your instructor and decide which dances you'll be dancing, and, perhaps, to go over the dance descriptions shortly prior to the dance.  It's a good idea to pick a more experienced partner for dances that you're less certain about, so that you will have more support should you need it.

===Briefing v Walk-throughs===
It's a very good idea to ask whether the dances will be introduced by being briefed or whether there will be walk-throughs.  If you're going to do so, however, you should know a little history of the controversy you will be edging into.

In the old days, when people generally lived their lives and died within a few hours walking distance of where they were born, and the number of dances to know was much smaller, each community would have its set of dances that everybody learned and knew.  From this the tradition was that you should already know how to do a dance before the dance comes, so the dance would not be taught at a dance.  Later, as this became less true, the standard became that the dance would be briefed from memory by an instructor, with, again, the idea that you should know a dance well before lining up to dance it.  Many groups still use this standard.  Other groups will provide one (or more) walk-through to make more certain that everybody lined up for a dance has some idea what they're doing, which makes matters much easier for beginners and those traveling to attend a dance. 

Those who prefer briefing only will explain that it saves time, so that more time can be spent dancing.  Those who prefer walk-throughs will point out that walked-through dances are more likely to work out the first time, so the dance is less likely to need to be repeated.  

Without attempting to resolve the point in this space (which would mean nothing to any given group) the point here is that you should know how many, if any, walk-throughs will be taking place, so as to give you an idea of how prepared you need to be when you get to the dance.  

=== Dance Etiquette ===


Note that the following are not necessarily all universal guidelines to dance etiquette in all places.  However, they should give you a plan you can follow as you walk into a dancing experience.  

The program for a dance is usually published well before the dance, so it will be no mystery in most cases what the next dance will be.  However, it is customary to not take a partner nor to line up before either the name of the dance is announced or a portion of the music for the dance has been played.  It is nice if ladies not be in too much of a hurry to pair up with other ladies, particularly if the dance is small, as this can lead to men not having ladies to partner with.  

When taking a partner, it is customary for the man to take the lady by her left hand and his right hand so that, as they walk toward the top of the hall (the side from which the music is coming), they are lined up on the proper sides.  The first man in the top set of each line is expected to count the couples of his line and assign them to their sets.  This is the equivalent to &quot;hands four from the top,&quot; and it can take some time to get the sets figured out.  

It is no longer expected that the man accompany his partner back to the seat she was in when he asked her – it is rather likely that she wasn't seated when he asked her and that that particular spot of the floor has no particular significance to her.  

As in Contra, there is an expectation that you will dance with different partners throughout the evening of dancing, and, as with Contra, it's usually easy to not have to repeat a partner in an evening of dance.

== Figures shared between Contra and SCD ==


Due to their common origins, Contra and SCD have some shared figures.  Some will be similar figures, and some will have similar names, and some will be both.

==Vector==
A vector is a mathematical quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction. The direction is usually expressed as an angle in degrees. For example if it is said  that a ball is rolling down a hill at 30 metres per second and the hill has a 30 degree slope then this is a vector quantity. However if it is only said that it is rolling down the hill at 30 metres per second then it is a scalar quantity. A scalar quantity will only give a magnitude and not a direction. In most mechanics problems the direction will have a profound impact on the motion.

===Representation of Vectors===
When you write a vector you must add an arrow to the top like so &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt;.  When you draw a vector you need to draw as an arrow slanted at approximately the same degree as the direction. The vector described above would be drawn as such: [[Image:M1vector1.svg|20px]].

==Components of  Force==
A force is a vector that can be separated into x and y components which are perpendicular to each other. We separate a force into components so that we can add multiple forces together. [[Image:M1vector2.svg|centre|230px]]

If you draw an accurate enough diagram you can find the x and y components. However this can be tedious and is error prone and is unacceptable on the A-level examination. Instead you need to use trigonometry to separate a vector into x and y components. The force is always the hypotenuse of the triangle. The angle, which is the direction that the force is applied, is usually given in degrees. However sometimes you will also find the angle given in the Cardinal directions (east, south, west, north,etc.).

===Example 1===
Find the x and y components of a 40 Newton force acting on a ball at a 30° angle.
#Using the mathematical formulae we get:
##&lt;math&gt;y\ Force = 40N \sin 30 = 20N\,&lt;/math&gt;
##&lt;math&gt;x\ Force = 40N \cos 30 = 34.64N \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 2===
Find the Angle &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;  if the resultant force is 24N and the y component of the force is 18.11N.
##Using the mathematical formulae we get:
##&lt;math&gt;\theta=\arcsin\left(\frac{18.11N}{24N}\right) =49^{\circ} \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Resultant Force==
	When multiple forces are acting on one object you will get a resultant force. The resultant force is how all the forces combined will act on the object. The procedure for finding the resultant force is as follows:
#Draw the forces and the angles on a Cartesian plane. This is to ensure that you get the right angles.
#Make all angle in terms of the positive x axis.
#Separate each force into its x and y components. 
#Add all the x and y components. You can also use  the '''i''' and '''j''' notation,  where '''i''' is the horizontal component  and '''j''' is the vertical component.
#Find the resultant force.
#Find the angle. If a force is negative make it positive. Then place the angle in the right quadrant, because the inverse tangent will place all angles in the first quadrant. If necessary review Core 2 Trigonometry.
===Example 1===
A group of people are playing football. The ball is kicked simultaneously by one person with a force of 60N at an angle of 73°, another kicks the ball with a force of 40N at a 20 angle west of south and the third kicks with a 100N force at a 124° angle. What is the resultant force and angle?
#Draw the forces and the angles on a Cartesian plane. This is to ensure that you get the correct angles.
#:[[Image:forceaddex1.svg|200px]]
#Make all angle in terms of the positive x axis.
#:The 60 N is acting at a 73° angle.
#:The 40 N is acting at a  250° angle.
#:The 100N is acting at a 124° angle.
#Separate each force into its x and y components. 
##For the x components
#:&lt;math&gt;x\ Force = 60N \cos 73 = 17.54N \,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;x\ Force = 40N \cos 250 = -13.68N \,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;x\ Force = 100N \cos 124 = -55.92N \,&lt;/math&gt;
##For the y components
#:&lt;math&gt;y\ Force = 60N \sin 73 = 57.38N \,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;y\ Force = 40N \sin 250 = -37.59N \,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;y\ Force = 100N \sin 124 = 82.9N \,&lt;/math&gt;
#Add all the x and y components.
## x Force =  17.54N - 13.68N - 55.92N = -52.06
## y Force =  57.38N - 37.59N + 82.9N = 102.69
#Find the resultant force.
#:&lt;math&gt;F_{resultant}=\sqrt(-52.06^2+102.69^2) = 115.13N&lt;/math&gt;
#Find the angle.
#:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{102.69}{52.06}\right)=63.11^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;
#:Since the cosine is negative and the sine is positive the angle is in the second quadrant. 180° - 63.11° = 116.88°.

The resultant force will be 115.13N and will act at a 116.88° angle.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objectives ==

By the end of this chapter you should be able to do the following:

Use (and recall) the definition of ''linear momentum'', and show an understanding of its vector nature in 1 dimension.

Understand and use ''conservation of linear momentum'', in 1 dimension, and solve simple problems involving direct collision of two bodies before and after impact.

== Momentum as a vector ==
Because momentum is defined to be mass times velocity, momentum is the product of a scalar and a vector, which is ultimately a vector.

&lt;math&gt;p = mv&lt;/math&gt;

== Conservation of Momentum ==

Within a closed system (i.e. a system not subject to an external influence) momentum is '''always''' conserved. Due to this, we can easily derive the following formula that is used in working out momentum:


&lt;math&gt; (M_1 * U_1) + (M_2 * U_2) = (M_1 * V_1) + (M_2 * V_2) &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

M = Mass
U = Initial Velocity
V = Velocity after collison

Whatever the momentum on the LHS, the total momentum on the RHS will be the same.


== Collisions ==

The conservation of momentum is best illustrated through an example question:

[[Image:Momentbefore.jpg]]

The system before the collision. 


[[Image:Momentafter.jpg]]

The system after the collision.

As we have all the values before the collision, we can use the formula above to work out the total momentum in the system:

&lt;math&gt;(2 * 5) + (5 * 0) = 10 \text{ Ns}&lt;/math&gt;

Now we know that momentum before = momentum after. So, &lt;math&gt;10 = (2 * 10) + (5v)&lt;/math&gt;. This may seem to be unworkable at first, but because velocity is a vector and the two balls are rolling in opposite directions, the 5kg ball has a negative velocity. 

Rearranging our formula we get &lt;math&gt;10 - 20 = 5v&lt;/math&gt;. Rearranging this again to &lt;math&gt;\frac{10 - 20} {5} = v&lt;/math&gt; we can see that &lt;math&gt;v = -2 {\text{ ms}}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

== Impulse ==

Impulse is the change in momentum, measured in Ns as with momentum. It is a vector quantity, with magnitude and direction. The impulse by B on A is A's change in momentum as a result of collision with B; it can be found with &lt;math&gt;m_1 * u_1 - m_1 * v_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Is there any particular reason that it uses Jesus as an example? That doesn't seem particularly neutral...

What's the idea of having a table where you have to inflect nouns in cases if we have studied only nominative case? And below the table is exercise to copy pronoun table from lesson 7, but lesson 7 seven doesn't exists anymore. I wonder if the table can be removed or should it be moved to some other lesson? (And sorry my bad english)

Pardon if I am not polite, but I really think that this chapter could have been made by a silly or a person who does not know how to build a book like this one. --[[Special:Contributions/84.77.146.109|84.77.146.109]] 19:28, 5 December 2007 (UTC)

== Poor Construction ==

I think this article needs to be overlooked by an editor with some experience. It is not very well written in its current state. [[Special:Contributions/220.101.40.217|220.101.40.217]] ([[User talk:220.101.40.217|talk]]) 11:02, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

== First Exercise - Present verbs ==

I was thrown a bit by 4. ''&quot;Conjugate the verb 'to be' in the past and present tense in English and Latin (I am, You are, He is etc.) &quot;''. It asks for 'past and present', but only gives the present tense in the answers. --[[Special:Contributions/59.167.249.210|59.167.249.210]] ([[User talk:59.167.249.210|talk]]) 04:16, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

==Exercise Under &quot;Tense&quot;==
The book, as it currently reads, tells the reader to &quot;fill out this table of noun declensions.&quot; While I can find the singular declensions (on the introductory page #2), I cannot find the plural declensions.--[[User:Phillipps|Phillipps]] ([[User talk:Phillipps|talk]]) 04:02, 18 May 2008 (UTC)

I would also like to add that while the exercise asks for the table to be filled in, it does not give the source of the information required (It was on page 2 of the introduction).  The table that I am referring to does contain an inaccuracy; it states that the table is only for illustration, '''not to be memorized''', and does not display the plural as this would be redundant.  This is wrong, as: 1. The table is the only source of information on the declensions, 2. The exercise says that the table has to be memorized, and 3. The plural would not be redundant as it is given nowhere else and is needed to complete the exercise.  In fact, the only plurals I could find were that of puella in the nominative case (only for the first two declensions), and several others in the accusative.--[[User:Phillipps|Phillipps]] ([[User talk:Phillipps|talk]]) 04:19, 18 May 2008 (UTC)

== Shortest sentece ==

Two Romans took a bet. Who writes the shortest sentence wins. First wrote &quot;EO RUS&quot; (I'll go to the countryside), second replied &quot;I&quot; (Go!)

Relevant?

: I wonder if it should be clarified to say the shortest complete sentence that is not an imperative.
: 
: Also of note is that the article says that the shortest sentence is written as &quot;You are&quot; in English.  It comes close to implying that &quot;You are&quot; is the shortest (complete, non-imperative) English sentence possible.  The article should state more explicitly that &quot;Es&quot; is the shortest Latin sentence (with honourable mention to the above, perhaps) prior to mentioning the English translation, rather than the other way around.  The shortest non-imperative, complete English sentence is actually similar to the Latin, but uses a different conjugation: &quot;I am.&quot;  The shortest incomplete sentence is &quot;I&quot; in certain circumstances (&quot;Who ate the cookies?&quot;), but that is technically a shorthand for &quot;[It was] I&quot;, and that construction is exceedingly pedantic as it is generally preferable to answer &quot;Me&quot; even if grammatically inferior.  The shortest imperative sentence is also, remarkably, &quot;Go.&quot;
: 
: The complete coincidence of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;Go&quot; is pretty fascinating, come to think of it. --[[Special:Contributions/208.181.64.45|208.181.64.45]] ([[User talk:208.181.64.45|discuss]]) 18:11, 12 February 2012 (UTC)</text>

Prisoner of Azkaban'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Riddikulus''''' is a spell used against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Boggart|boggarts]]. The caster must think of something funny while casting this spell. If successful, it forces the boggart to take the shape of whatever the caster was thinking about. As boggarts feed on fear and are defeated by laughter, the object of the spell, ultimately is to make the boggart laughable.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We see this spell invoked several times in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 7|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]] is teaching the spell to his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence against the Dark Arts]] class. While Professor Lupin does provide a Boggart for use in Harry's anti-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] lessons, we don't see the Riddikulus spell being used against it. The spell appears again in that book when a Boggart is one of the tests [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban/Chapter 16|in the final exam]].

A Boggart plays a role in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|Third Task maze]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 31|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. The effect of the Riddikulus spell here is uncertain.

A Boggart also appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] is trying to use the Riddikulus spell against it, and is repeatedly failing. The change of aspect forced by the spell, however, allows Harry to note that Mrs. Weasley cares as much about his own welfare as she does about any of her family.

== Analysis ==

This spell is of quite limited usefulness, being effective against Boggarts only, at least within our story arc. That said, it is used, as mentioned, a number of times in the series. The fact that Professor Lupin is able to find Boggarts on demand, at least twice and possibly three times during the school year, does indicate that they are relatively common in the Wizarding world.

The author is mute on how Boggarts can be handled in the case where there is no real way to make one's greatest fear seem funny. We see two cases of that in the series: Lupin's greatest fear being the full moon, and Mrs. Weasley's greatest fear being the death of her family members. We note that Lupin does not try to use the Riddikulus spell himself, instead using some wordless form of magic to force the Boggart back into its hiding place.

As an aside, we note that Lupin used up his one and only (at that point) Boggart teaching the Riddikulus spell to the Gryffindors. We wonder what lesson he taught the Slytherins, Ravenclaws, and Hufflepuffs.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#What would be the effect of casting Riddikulus on a non-Boggart?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One main reason for the Boggart's existence, as mentioned on the write-up of that creature, is to provide an incontrovertible method of displaying the characters' deepest fears. As such, there must be some spell to fight them. Given that the Boggart inspires fear so as to feed on it, that which destroys it must be the antithesis to fear. Having the Boggart be defeated by laughter is, in fact, quite logical, but the author's choice of the spell and its results, and her choice in handing it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] for the first and the most effective invocations, seems somehow inspired.

== 1. Have the Microscopic Life honor. ==
{{ay prerequisite|Nature|Microscopic Life}}

== 2. Name two major constituents of blood.  What is the percentage of each in normal blood? ==
Human blood consists of about 45% blood cells, and 55% plasma.

== 3. Be able to draw pictures of and name the 7 types of blood cells and indicate what each type does. ==

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Blood cells are treated with a staining agent before they are photographed so that identifiable features will stand out.

'''1. Red Blood Cells''' are responsible for transporting oxygen to other cells in the body, and for collecting carbon dioxide from them for disposal. Red blood cells can be identified by their donut-shape.

'''2. Platelets''' are the blood cell fragments that are involved in the cellular mechanisms that lead to the formation of blood clots.  Platelets appear in most of the photographs above  as tiny, irregular, bluish specks.

'''3. Neutrophils''', are a type of white blood cell which travel to infected tissue and surround bacteria, rendering them harmless to the body.  The picture above shows two neutrophils surrounded by multiple red blood cells.  Neutrophils have segmented nuclei and small granules that stain purple.

'''4. Eosinophils''', are a second type of white blood cells and are responsible for combating infections by parasites.  Eosinophils are filled with large granules that stain red.

'''5. Basophils''' are a third type of white blood cell which store histamine, a chemical that is secreted by the cells when stimulated in certain ways (histamine causes some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction). Basophils tend to appear in specific kinds of inflammatory reactions, particularly those that cause allergic symptoms.  Basophils have large, dark granules in the cell that may cover the nucleus.

'''6. Lymphocytes''' are a fourth type of white blood cell involved in the human body's immune system. There are two broad categories of lymphocytes, namely T cells and B cells. T cells are especially important in cell-mediated immunity, which is the defense against tumor cells and pathogenic organisms inside body cells. They are also involved in rejection reactions.  B cells, in the presence of an antigen (a substance that stimulates an immune response), can become much more metabolically active and differentiate into plasma cells, which secrete large quantities of antibodies.  Lymphocytes have no granules, and they have very large nuclei that take up nearly all of the cell's area.  

'''7. Monocytes''', are a fifth type of white blood cell which also travel to infected tissue and turn into ''macrophages''.  As macrophages, these cells kill germs (including cancer cells) and start the production of antibodies.  Like neutrophils, monocytes have no granules, but their nuclei take up only about half the cell's area.  A monocyte's nucleus often has an indentation in it.

== 4. Observe some preserved human blood under a microscope.  Count 100 white blood cells and draw a graph showing the number of each of the five types of white blood cells you found.  Which type is most common?  Which type is least common? ==

Prepared microscope slides are offered for sale at many scholastic supply houses.  Many retailers offering such slides have an Internet presence.  Before spending money on this, check with a local high school biology teacher.  They will have microscopes and very well may have slides on hand already.

The charts below show the expected distribution of the different types of cells.  It is possible that you may not see any eosinophils or basophils in your sample since they are so rare and you're only looking at 100 white blood cells.

== 5. Do at least one of the following and report on what you observed. ==
=== Observe blood being drawn from someone's arm by a medical professional. ===
This requirement can be met by organizing a blood drive for your church.  Blood donation organizations will not accept blood from minors, but there are still ample opportunities for the Pathfinders to help in other ways.  This is an excellent way to meet the Community Service requirements for the AY curriculum.

Invite the organization to have a blood drive at your church.  Well before the date of the blood drive, have the Pathfinders advertise the event (this is a good opportunity to earn the Lettering and Poster Making honor).  Be sure to announce the blood drive in church for several weeks.  On the day of the event, the Pathfinders should help set everything up, greet people, hand out paper work to the donors, serve cookies and juice, and clean up afterwards.

=== With the help of an experienced person, observe blood flowing through some capillaries (either on video tape or in a living organism such as a hamster cheek-pouch, frog skin, or goldfish tail, using a microscope). ===
This downloadable
[http://www.klbschool.org.uk/interactive/science/heart_hlp.htm movie clip] shows blood flowing through a capillary, but it's very short.  Its shortness does make for a quick download (56Kbytes).  It is best to play the movie in &quot;loop&quot; mode.

This much longer (11 Mbytes) [http://www.apsarchive.org/renalpelvis/caliceal_dynamics_capillaries.htm movie clip] also shows blood flowing through a capillary.

=== Visit a medical lab where blood tests are performed. ===
Talk to your personal physician or a doctor in your church to find out where the local medical labs are.

=== Visit a blood bank. ===
Contact your local [[w:Red Cross|Red Cross]] to arrange a visit.  You can find your local chapter at their
[http://www.redcross.org website].

== 6. What two gases are transported by the red blood cells?  Explain why blood appears blue/green in your veins, but if you cut yourself, the blood that comes out is bright red.  Explain why a lack of iron in your diet might make you have yellowish-colored blood.==
Red blood cells transport oxygen to the rest of the body and carry the carbon dioxide away.  Blood carrying oxygen appears bright red.  When you cut yourself, your blood is exposed to oxygen in the air, and this is sufficient to cause it to turn color.  When little oxygen is present is the blood, it is still red, but it is much darker, tending more towards black.  Blood is  neither blue nor green inside your veins, but it looks this way sometimes because the veins themselves and pigment in your skin impart a bluish tint.

Blood carries oxygen by letting it bind loosely with iron.  Without sufficient iron in the blood, its oxygen carrying capacity is reduced.  Since oxygen is what makes the blood bright red, it cannot assume this color without iron.  Blood plasma is yellow, so when the red cells cannot impart their color to the blood with full power, the underlying color of the plasma has a greater influence.

== 7. Explain how blood clots when you are injured. How does typical &quot;First Aid&quot; help in the process?==
Blood clotting occurs in two stages called ''primary hemostasis'' and ''secondary hemostasis.''  Primary hemostasis begins immediately after the wall of a blood vessel is broken.  Platelets in the blood bind to a protein called collagen which is found in the vessel wall.  Normally the collagen is hidden from the platelets, but when the blood vessel is broken, it becomes exposed.  When the platelets bind with the collagen, it forms a plug which slows the flow of blood through the break in the blood vessel.

Secondary hemostasis takes place over the next couple of hours.  A protein in the blood called ''fibrinogen'' is converted to ''fibrin'' which is long and string-like.  The fibrin forms a mesh which makes the clot larger, eventually sealing the break in the blood vessel.

Typical first aid for bleeding concentrates on slowing and stopping the flow of blood from the wound.  If the blood is allowed to pool around the wound instead of flowing out of it, more platelets and fibrinogen is available on the scene and the clot can form more quickly.

== 8. What does it mean to be a blood donor?  If possible, know your blood type.  What types of blood can be donated to you?  Which blood types cannot be donated to you? Why?==

Being a blood donor means that a person allows his or her blood to be drawn so that it can be used at a later time.  Sometimes the blood is used by another person, and sometimes the blood is used by the donor herself.  Often when a person is scheduled for surgery and has plenty of advance notice, she has the opportunity to bank some of her own blood.  This is called an autologous donation.  Autologous blood donations do not need to be screened for things like AIDS or hepatitis because the person cannot contract a disease from herself.  If she has the disease, she has the disease.  If she doesn't, she won't contract it from her own blood.  However, if the blood donation is ''not'' autologous, it is carefully screened for all types of potential diseases so that the person receiving it does not contract it from the transfusion.

Before donating blood, the donor must fill out an extensive questionaire.  If the donor has traveled in certain foreign countries recently (where tropical diseases are common, for instance), or if the person is at high risk for contracting AIDS, the blood donation will not be accepted.  Blood is also not accepted from people who have ever had cancer, hepatitis, or any number of other diseases.

Once the forms have been filled out, the blood type is tested, and then the donor lies on a table.  A tube is inserted in an arm vein (this may involve a little pain, but it is brief and not severe), and the donor is then asked to squeeze a rubber ball.  The amount of time spent lying on the table depends on how quickly a pint of blood can be extracted, but it ranges between five and twenty minutes.  When a pint of blood has been extracted, the tube is removed and the donor may slowly sit up.  The wound is bandaged, and free cookies and juice are served to replenish the donor's body fluids and restore sugar.

'''Blood typing''' can be done at home or in the classroom.
[http://www.sargentwelch.com Sargent-Welch] sells blood typing kits that will test the blood type of 50 individuals for about $1.00 per person.  These kits are made for educational settings.

[http://www.healthhometest.com Health Hometest] has kits you can buy for testing a single person for about $10.00.

[http://nobelprize.org/medicine/educational/landsteiner/index.html Nobelprize.org] has an online &quot;Blood Typing Game&quot; for determining the blood type of a virtual patient.

The ABO and Rh blood typing systems categorize blood according to the way antigens and antibodies behave in a person's blood.  

'''ABO Groups:'''

* '''Blood Group A:''' Persons with type A blood have type A antigens on the surface of their red blood cells and type B antibodies in their blood plasma.
* '''Blood Group B:''' Persons with type B blood have type B antigens on the surface of their red blood cells and type A antibodies in their blood plasma.
* '''Blood Group AB:''' Persons with type AB blood have both type A and type B antigens on the surface of their red blood cells and neither type A nor type B antibodies in their blood plasma.
* '''Blood Group O:''' Persons with type O blood have neither type A nor type B antigens on the surface of their red blood cells and they have both type A and type B antibodies in their blood plasma.

'''Rh Factor:'''
* '''Rh Positive''' blood has Rh antigens on the surface of the red blood cells, and does not have Rh antibodies in the blood plasma.
* '''Rh negative''' blood does not have Rh antigens on the surface of their red blood cells.  It does not naturally have Rh antibodies in the blood plasma, but it can develop them if exposed to Rh positive antigens (if for instance, Rh+ blood is given to an Rh- patient).

The ABO group and Rh factor are combined to specify the blood type.  So a person with type AB+ (pronounced AB positive) blood has type AB blood and is Rh positive.

The blood plasma and corpuscles (red cells, white cells, and platelets) are separated in donated blood before it is transfused into a patient.  This removes most of the donor's antibodies from the blood since the antibodies are present in the plasma.  Because antibodies attack cells with a specific antigen marker, people with type A antibodies cannot receive blood that has type A antigens.  If a person with type A antibodies receives blood with type A antigens, the patient's blood will attack the donated blood causing it to clump together and eventually break down.  When the cells break down, they can release toxins that could possibly kill the patient.  The same holds for type B and type Rh antigens and antibodies.

== 9. Tell two stories in the Bible in which blood is involved.  From what you know about blood, why do you think that the Bible uses blood as a symbol of God's saving power?==

* '''Joseph's brothers''' dip his coat in blood before returning to their father.  Genesis 37:12-36.
* '''The Nile turns to blood''' during the showdown between Moses and Pharaoh. Exodus 7:14-24.
* During '''Passover''' the angel of death passes over houses marked with blood. Exodus 12:1-30.
* Blood is taken into the Most Holy Place on the '''Day of Atonement.''' Leviticus 16
* '''The priests of Baal''' cut themselves in their contest with Elijah on Mount Carmel.  1 Kings 18:16-40.
* '''King Ahab''' bleeds to death in his chariot.  1 Kings 22:29-40.
* '''The Last Supper''' is a symbol of Christ's body and blood.  Luke 22:7-32.
* '''Jesus's side is pierced''' on the cross and blood and water flows out.  John 19:28-37.
* '''The saints' robes''' washed in the blood of Jesus.  Revelation 7:15

Blood is responsible for collecting waste from all over our bodies.  In this sense, it literally washes us on the inside, just as Christ's blood washes away our sins.

== 10. List 10 specific health habits that can help your body stay healthy and fight off infection.  Find a reference from the Spirit of Prophesy that supports each one of these.  Keep a record for three weeks of how often you repeat these 10 habits.==

*'''1. Proper Diet.'''  ''&quot;When we feed on flesh, the juices of what we eat pass into the circulation. A feverish condition is created, because the animals are diseased; and by partaking of their flesh we plant the seeds of disease in our own tissue and blood.&quot;'' Healthful Living, p 212

*'''2. Fresh Air.''' ''&quot;The effects produced by living in close, ill-ventilated rooms are these: The system becomes weak and unhealthy, the circulation is depressed, the blood moves sluggishly through the system because it is not purified and ventilated by the pure, invigorating air of heaven. The mind becomes depressed and gloomy, while the whole system is enervated, and fevers and other acute diseases are liable to be generated.&quot;''-- Healthful Living, p 212.

*'''3. Get Plenty of Sleep.''' Your immune system replenishes itself while you sleep, so not getting enough sleep robs it of the time it needs to fully recharge.  The amount of sleep a person needs varies from one individual to another, but most people need eight hours per night.  If you wake up exhausted, you're not getting enough sleep.
''&quot;They may be weary, but how sweet is rest after a proper amount of labor. Sleep, nature's sweet restorer, invigorates the tired body and prepares it for the next day's duties.&quot;''--Child Guidance, pp 341,342.

*'''4. Avoid Caffeine.''' Caffeine interferes with your ability to get to sleep, so it should be avoided - especially after noon.
''&quot;The stimulating diet and drink of this day are not conducive to the best state of health. Tea, coffee, and tobacco are all stimulating, and contain poisons. They are not only unnecessary, but harmful, and should be discarded if we would add to knowledge, temperance.&quot;''--Review and Herald, Feb. 21, 1888. 

*'''5. Do Not Drink Alcohol.'''  ''&quot;Alcohol and tobacco pollute the blood of men, and thousands of lives are yearly sacrificed to these poisons.&quot;''--Health Reformer, November, 1871.

*'''6. Do Not Use Tobacco.'''  See above.

*'''7. Be Happy.'''  A cheerful heart does good, like a medicine.
''&quot;Let the sunshine of love, cheer, and happy content enter your own hearts, and let its sweet influence pervade the home. . . . The atmosphere thus created will be to the children what air and sunshine are to the vegetable world, promoting health and vigor of mind and body.&quot;''--Sons and Daughters of God, pg 168.

*'''8. Regular Exercise.'''  ''&quot;In many cases the sickness of children can be traced to errors in management. Irregularities in eating, insufficient clothing in the chilly evening, lack of vigorous exercise to keep the blood in healthy circulation, or lack of abundance of air for its purification, may be the cause of the trouble. Let the parents study to find the causes of the sickness and then remedy the wrong conditions as soon as possible.&quot;''--Adventist Home, pg 263.

*'''9. Regular Bathing.''' Taking a bath or a shower regularly washes pathogens from your skin and thus, away from your body.
''&quot;Persons in health should . . . by all means bathe as often as twice a week. Those who are not in health have impurities of the blood. . . . The skin needs to be carefully and thoroughly cleansed, that the pores may do their work in freeing the body from impurities; therefore feeble persons who are diseased surely need the advantages and blessings of bathing as often as twice a week, and frequently even more than this is positively necessary.&quot;''-- Testimonies to the Church, Volume III, p. 70.

*'''10. Wear Clean Clothing.''' Clothes that are worn day after day accumulate dirt and bacteria.  Change into clean clothing every day and keep the &quot;nasties&quot; away.
''&quot;It is important also that the clothing be kept clean. The garments worn absorb the waste matter that passes off through the pores; if they are not frequently changed and washed, the impurities will be reabsorbed.&quot;''--Child Guidance pg 109.

*'''11. Keep Your Home Clean.''' Bacteria love dirt.  Keep it out of your house.  Allow plenty of sunshine to enter your house during the day, and allow fresh air in as often as possible.  Sunshine kills many forms of bacteria, and stale air harbors it.
''&quot;I have often seen children's beds in such a condition that the foul, poisonous odor constantly rising from them was to me unendurable. Keep everything the eyes of the children rest upon and that comes in contact with the body, night or day, clean and wholesome. This will be one means of educating them to choose the cleanly and the pure. Let the sleeping room of your children be neat, however destitute it may be of expensive furniture.&quot;''--Child Guidance pg 109.

== 11. Define the following terms related to the body's defenses: ==

*'''Immunology:'''  a broad branch of biomedical science that covers the study of all aspects of the immune system in all organisms.
*'''Pathogen:''' a biological agent that causes disease or illness to its host.
*'''Inflammation:''' a pathological condition of any part of the body. It is manifested outwardly by redness and swelling, attended with heat and pain.
*'''Antibody:''' a protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses. Each antibody recognizes a specific antigen unique to its target.
*'''Memory Cells:''' are a type of lymphocte (also known as memory B cells) that are formed following primary infection. When a B cell is activated by recognizing a specific antigen, it quickly reproduces to form antibody producing plasma cells and long-lived memory cells. The memory B cells are specific for the antigen that first stimulated their production.
*'''Immunity:''' a state of having sufficient biological defenses to avoid infection, disease, or other unwanted biological invasion.
*'''Vaccine:''' a medication given to stimulate the body's production of antibodies and provide immunity against a disease, prepared from the agent that causes the disease, or a synthetic substitute.
*'''Allergy:''' an immune malfunction whereby a person's body is over-sensitive to a substance that is harmless to most people, causing the immune system to attack it.
*'''Histamine:''' a chemical released by basophils and ''mast cells'' (which are very simlar to basophils) and causing an immune response.  In some cases, the response is unwarranted because the invading substance is harmless.  In this case, the response is known as an allergic reaction.  Histamines cause inflammation of the tissue, watery eyes, itching, runny nose, and sneezing.
*'''Antihistamine:''' a drug that suppresses the release of histamine.  Examples include the prescription drugs Clarinex, Allegra, and Zyrtec, and the over-the-counter drugs Claratin and Benadryl.

== 12. Poison ivy and poison oak are often encountered by active Pathfinders.  Be able to identify poison ivy and poison oak, and know how to avoid having allergic reactions to them, and explain what to do if you get an allergic reaction to either of them. ==

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Toxicodendron_radicans.jpg|Poison Ivy
Image:PoisonOak_wb_biggerLeaves.jpg|Poison Oak
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Poison ivy is shown in the picture on the left.  Poison Oak is on the right.  Learn to identify these by sight.  Poison ivy most often grows on &quot;disturbed&quot; ground, including stream banks, roadsides, and the edge of woods.  Both these plants contain an oil called urushiol which causes allergic reactions if it comes into contact with your skin.  Contact can be made directly (by touching the plant) or indirectly (by touching something that has touched the plant, such as a clothing, a friend, or a pet).  

The best way to avoid having an allergic reaction to either of these is to avoid them.  In order to avoid them, you must be able to recognize them.  If you do come into contact with either of these, wash the affected areas with hot soapy water as soon as possible.  Wash clothes in hot water too.  If your pet has contacted poison ivy or poison oak, wash him in hot soapy water to remove the oil from his fur.  The oil will not harm your pet (most animals are not allergic to urushiol), but your pet can easily transfer the oil to you.

If you still get an allergic reaction, treatment depends on the severity of the reaction.  

Seek emergency medical treatment under the following conditions:
# Swelling of the throat.
# Difficulty breathing.
# Weakness or dizziness.
# Bluish lips.
# Unconsciousness.

You should see a doctor if any of the following apply:
# A large area of the body is affected.
# Rash on the face.
# Rash around the eyes, mouth, or genitals.
# A rash with pus.

You may otherwise self-treat:
# For minor rashes, apply Calamine lotion (''not'' Caladryl), zinc oxide, or a mix of 3 teaspoons of baking soda with one teaspoon of water.  
# Take an over-the-counter antihistamine such as Benadryl.  
# Do not scratch

== 13. Make a list of as many as possible of the infectious diseases that you have had.  Which ones are you now immune to?  Explain why or why not. ==

A person acquires immunity to diseases he is exposed to either by contracting the disease or by receiving a vaccination.  Vaccinations are weakened forms of the disease-causing ''pathogen'', and they stimulate the immune system to develop a defense against that particular pathogen.

Some diseases, such as influenza, mutate frequently, and the immune system having developed a defense against one strain is not prepared for the new, mutated strain.  This is why flu shots are given annually.  The vaccine is developed to combat ''this'' years version of the flu.

Other diseases such as tetanus and diphtheria require booster shots every 10 years to maintain the body's immunity.

== 14. From your personal medical records, list all of the vaccinations that you have had and determine from your doctor when your next vaccination should be. ==
Encourage your Pathfinders to ask their parents about their immunization records.  These days pediatricians usually send immunization records home with the parents, so they should have them somewhere at home. 

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that vaccinations be given according to the schedule below.  For a more up-to-date schedule, visit the [http://www.cdc.gov CDC's website].

&lt;br style=&quot;clear all&quot;&gt;

== 15. Write or tell about one infectious disease (at least 250 words). ==
An infectious disease is any sickness caused by a biological agent (such as a virus, bacteria, or parasite) as opposed to being caused by a physical agent (such as a burn or a cut).

Here is a list of infectious diseases common today:
[[w:AIDS|AIDS]], [[w:Measles|measles]], [[w:Tuberculosis|tuberculosis]], [[w:Malaria|malaria]], [[w:Pertussis|pertussis]] (whooping cough), [[w:Tetanus|tetanus]], [[w:Meningitis|meningitis]], [[w:Chicken pox|chicken pox]], [[w:influenza|influenza]] (the flu), and [[w:Hepatitis|hepatitis]].

Other infectious diseases have been largely eliminated through the use of vaccines, including [[w:Polio|polio]], [[w:Smallpox|smallpox]], and [[w:Diphtheria|diphtheria]].

== 16. What is AIDS? How is it spread? Is there a cure?  Why is it so devastating? ==
AIDS is an acronym for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or acquired immune deficiency syndrome and is defined as a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the immune system caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, commonly called HIV.  Although treatments for both AIDS and HIV exist to slow the virus' progression in a human patient, there is no known cure.

AIDS is the most severe manifestation of infection with HIV. HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects vital components of the human immune system such as certain T cells and macrophages. It also destroys T cells. As T cells are required for the proper functioning of the immune system, when enough T cells have been destroyed by HIV, the immune system barely works, leading to AIDS.

The symptoms of AIDS are primarily the result of conditions that do not normally develop in people with healthy immune systems. Most of these conditions are infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that are normally controlled by the elements of the immune system that HIV damages.  Nearly every organ system is affected. 

Three main transmission routes of HIV have been identified:

#'''Sexual route.''' The majority of HIV infections have been, and still are, acquired through unprotected sexual relations. Sexual transmission occurs when there is contact between sexual secretions of one partner with the rectal, genital or mouth mucous membranes of another.
#'''Blood or blood product route.''' This transmission route is particularly important for intravenous drug users, hemophiliacs and recipients of blood transfusions and blood products. Health care workers (nurses, laboratory workers, doctors etc.) are also concerned, although more rarely. Also concerned by this route are people who give and receive tattoos and piercings.
#'''Mother-to-child route (vertical transmission).''' The transmission of the virus from the mother to the child can occur in utero during the last weeks of pregnancy and at childbirth. Breast feeding also presents a risk of infection for the baby. In the absence of treatment, the transmission rate between the mother and child was 20%. However, where treatment is available, combined with the availability of Cesarean section, this has been reduced to 1%.

== Overview ==

A '''''hippogriff''''' is a creature that has the &quot;body, hind legs, and tail of a horse; but the front legs, wings, and head of what seemed to be a giant eagle, with a cruel, steel-colored beak and large, brilliant orange eyes. The talons on its front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking.&quot;

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], we are introduced to Hippogriffs by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]], then teaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Care of Magical Creatures|Care of Magical Creatures]]. Like many of Hagrid's favorite creatures, Hippogriffs can be dangerous to handle.

=== &quot;Things You Gotta Know About Hippogriffs&quot; ===
(as mentioned by Rubeus Hagrid in ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'')
*they're proud
*they're easily offended
*never insult one, 'cause it might be the last thing you do
*always wait for the hippogriff to make the first move
*it's polite
*try not to blink if you're facing one, hippogriff don't trust you if you blink too much
*never pull any of hippogriff's feathers, they won't like it
*to ride a hippogriff, climb up just behind the wing joint

=== Approaching A Hippogriff ===
Because they are polite there is a proper way to approach them. &quot;Walk toward him or her, and you bow, and you wait. If he or she bows back, you're allowed to touch him. If he or she doesn't bow, then get away from him or her sharpish; 'cause those talons hurts.&quot;

== Analysis ==

In an interview provided at the time of the theatrical release of the third film, the animators responsible for the sequences involving Hippogriffs mentioned that they had very little to work from. Hippogriffs are mentioned in Muggle mythology, and are described but apparently very rarely depicted. Given this, there is some question as to why Hippogriffs were selected at all. Looking at the story, though, we see that a means was needed to effect an escape for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]], one that would allow him to travel out of England relatively quickly. Wit the alarm raised in the magical and Muggle worlds, about his only means of escape would be a magical flying object. Harry's broom, of course, is right out; while Sirius had bought it for Harry, it would have been far too much of a wrench, and far too hard to explain, if Harry were to give that to Sirius for him to escape on. So we must have some other means of flying Sirius away. We have not seen flying carpets, and as it turns out we will not; there is some reason for disallowing their importation, as we find out in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. Sirius has given his flying motorcycle to Hagrid, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]]'s flying car is likely no longer up to a long trip, even if it ever does forsake its home in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. So we must bring in some other means of flying; and the author, apparently, went through Muggle mythology to find a creature that could fly and was large enough, and possibly even-tempered enough, to be ridden. The characteristics of Hippogriffs, as mentioned above, are pure invention as far as we can tell, but they are very apt, as they reflect aspects of Hagrid's character that we are only now beginning to appreciate, and result in illumination also of the characters of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|his father]]. Additionally, they provide the set up for much of this story's secondary theme of the meaning and value of friendship, and allow for Buckbeak's departure without particular repercussions.

== Overview ==

'''''Tarantallegra''''' is a jinx that causes uncontrollable &quot;dancing&quot;.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Tarantallegra, the Dancing jinx, apparently causes uncontrollable jerking and twitching in the legs of the person against whom it is cast. It can apparently can be stopped by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Finite Incantatem|Finite Incantatem]] charm. We first see this spell when it is cast against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] in the Dueling Club.

It was later used in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Ministry of Magic]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]; the intent in that case was to prevent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] from escaping.

== Analysis ==

The Harry Potter story arc, consisting as it does of an epic struggle between good and evil, will have fights, larger battles, and perhaps even an all-out war. In order to prevent the series, ostensibly for children, from becoming excessively dark, there must be non-lethal weapons for the protagonists to use. To that end, the author has provided us with a number of disabling spells, ranging from the simple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|stunning]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmament]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Incarcerous|binding]] jinxes, through to those with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Rictusempra|humorous effects]], like this one. It is uncertain why there would need to be so many different ways to disable, but we can surmise that the author has at least some reason for use of each variety. The Tarantallegra jinx seems to be of limited use, as the actual effect, uncontrollable motions of the legs, would have little effect on the ability of the target to cast spells; it does, however, prevent escape of the subject, as he is unable to walk. We surmise that this jinx was included as acknowledgement of Muggle fairy tales that mention magic forcing someone to dance until they die of exhaustion.

[[Category:Emergency Medicine]]

For those already familiar with CPR, a summary of recent changes is at the European Resuscitation Council
website. {{ref|ERC}}

This summary summarizes changes under the categories : basic adult resusc, automated defibrillators, 
advanced adult , advanced paediatric ;

advanced adult is subdivided to order of CPR/defibrillation is a) defib first in professional witnessed arrest, b) defibrillation technique is one shock and CPR for 2 minutes before other shocks , c) doubtful fine VF is not worth shocking delay of CPR, d) adrenaline 1mg after 2nd shock or non VF/VT / rate is 3-5 minutely,  e) vf/vt - amiodarone (load 300mg +/- 150mg, 900mg /24h) XOR lignocaine (max 3mg/kg/hr), f) PE/thrombolysis/prolonged CPR 60-90 minutes ,  g) hypothermia to 32deg for 12-24 hours definitely for out of hospital VF/VT, and maybe for all others ( in hospital all, out of hospital non VF/VT).

The principles might be: minimize circulation downtime ( a, b, c), provide drugs better or earlier (d e f),
more tenacity  in rescue ( f and g) . 


ABC - airway , breathing , compression.
This in general describes conceptual categories, but
is also the sequence of management in CPR: airways first, breathing next, compression of the heart.

The exception is when immediate defibrillation is available, AND equipment to diagnose 
ventricular tachyarrythmia or ventricular fibrillation is available. Then the sequence is : 
observed unexpected collapse + known history suggests ventricular fibrillation: e.g. was complaining of chest discomfort  -&gt;  attach equipment  -&gt; diagnose VF ( automatic or manual) -&gt; 
attach defibrillation pads -&gt; charge equipment to 200J (or wait automatic) -&gt; warn bystanders -&gt; defibrillate.
If manual, defibrillate x 3 , before resuming normal CPR sequence if still in ventricular fibrillation.

This is taken from an observed successful resuscitation of a witnessed arrest , as applied by
an experienced provincial emergency specialist nurse.  

It has some contrast to the recommended DRABCD sequence as per Guideline 7, February 2006, of the
Australian Resuscitation Council {{ref|ARC_CPR_FEB06}} , but is similar to the European Guidelines Summary
of Changes 2005 {{ref|ERC}}.

The pros and cons are : the first scenario meets the minimum time to defibrillation for successful
defibrillation criteria ; the first scenario maximizes the success rate of the cardiac arrest
resuscitation, as VF/VT arrest has a higher rate of successful treatment that asystolic and electromechanical dissociation arrest ; the second scenario is much easier to remember as mnemonic, and is a more
general framework for resuscitation from all causes , including primary airway obstruction causes, 
and hypoventilation/hypoxemia as a cause of unconsciousness.

DRABC is Danger Response, Airways, Breathing , Compression {{ref|ARC_CPR_FEB06}}.

== Danger == 
- remove from danger. Ensure your own safety - e.g. do not commence resuscitation in the
middle of a undiverted road.  

  D could also be DELEGATE - initiate a PHONE call for help (in Australia, dial 000 for emergency ambulance)
or request another to get help.
The RATIONALE for DELEGATE, is that in cardiac arrest where it is ventricular fibrillation,
the most effective management is electrical defibrillation, available when the ambulance arrives.

== Response ==
  check for consciousness - ask the patient to OPEN EYES and SQUEEZE MY HAND  , 
and also SHAKE THE SHOULDERS if an uninjured adult, or if a child, or adult suspected of spinal injury,
 apply PRESSURE STIMULUS ; anything less than or equal to a GROAN , is regarded as UNCONSCIOUSNESS.  {{ref|ARC_UNCONSCIOUS}}

== Airway == 
the aim is to open an obstructed , naturally positioned airway.
In an uninjured adult, CHIN LIFT and HEAD TILT ; in injured adult or small child, CHIN LIFT only.
an uninjured child may be SLIGHTLY TILTED, but AVOID PUSHING ON THE SOFT TISSUE OF THE NECK, and causing another source of obstruction.

CHIN LIFT can be achieved with - PINCER GRIP, PISTOL GRIP, or ANGLE OF JAW THRUST VERTICAL UPWARDS when the patient is lying horizontally face upwards (supine)
(ANGLE OF JAW is where the angle of the L shape of the side profile of the jaw is)

The rationale behind CHIN LIFT, is that by lifting the jaw forwards, this pulls up the tongue away from
the opening of the larynx, and opens up the collapsed larynx.  

In practice, a successful airway management is when spontaneous breathing is heard with the
ear placed over the mouth, or when artificial respiration results in the patient being heard to breath out again , and the chest move up and down.

==== CONSCIOUS SEVERE OBSTRUCTED AIRWAY (CHOKING WITH INEFFECTIVE COUGH) ====
INEFFECTIVE COUGH is where the patient appears not to be getting enough air between coughs, or is not
coughing and not breathing and unable to speak.

This is managed by ALTERNATING 5 BACK BLOWS between the shoulder blades with the palm, with 5 STERNAL THRUSTS with the palm {{ref|ARC_AIRWAY}};  this is different from the Heimlich maneuver, which was thrusting the diaphragm upwards with a fist in palm hands , whilst holding the patient from behind and under the armpits ;
this maneuver could cause internal organ injury, such as rupturing the spleen or liver .
If the patient is UNCONSCIOUS and was CHOKING, commence CPR as Airways , Breathing , Circulation described
here. {{ref|ARC_AIRWAY}}

== BREATHING ==
The new recommendation is to give 2 rescue breaths ; if the rescuer is unwilling
to give rescue breaths , mouth to mouth, with or without a separation device
e.g. a pocket resuscitation mask, a piece of glad wrap with a central hole over the mouth opening,
a piece of paper with a central hole over the mouth opening,
  then it is still important to provide circulation as below, with or without attempted expired air resuscitation.
  ANY ATTEMPT AT RESUSCITATION IS BETTER THAN NONE; BUT CALL FOR HELP (DIAL 000) , SO THAT
DEFINITIVE THERAPY CAN BE GIVEN. ANY ATTEMPT IS BUYING MORE TIME FOR DEFINITE HELP TO ARRIVE.

It is this author's experience, that mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, whilst lifting the patient's
chin, is MUCH EASIER than trying to ventilate the patient with a device such as a BAG AND MASK. The
only thing easier to ventilate, is a CORRECTLY SITED TRACHEAL INTUBATED patient ( getting to that
status though, is not easy).
 
The provision of artificial ventilation is probably the primary therapy for OPIATE OVERDOSE, other
than administering an opiate antagonist, such as NALOXONE;

there are anecdotes of drug affected patients being kept alive till the drug overdose wears
off , by other drug affected people with brains enough to provide expired air resuscitation
, but still not responsible enough to seek hospital or ambulance help. 
It is probably on par with being responsible human beings as drug buddies that dump the ODed user at the front door of the casualty department or the GP clinic , after attracting the attention of the triage nurse/receptionist.  Druggies can be heroes too ( like extreme sportsmen helping an injured fellow ?)
   Like the above statement about resuscitation, ANY ATTEMPT TO REMOVE FROM DANGER IS BETTER THAN NONE.

== COMPRESSION ==

Updated first aid guidelines for laypersons now downplay the significance of checking for a pulse, thus circulation.
Laypersons are advised to commence CPR immediately should the victim not be breathing.

external cardiac compression is achieved by placing 2 hands palm downwards over the MIDDLE OF LOWER HALF OF THE STERNUM , and leaning one's whole upper body onto STRAIGHT ARMS HELD VERTICAL OVER THE PATIENT, and pushing
down in a piston action, to a DEPTH of about 5 cm for adults, or
 ONE-THIRD THE DEPTH OF THE CHEST.

  In an INFANT, 2 FINGERS SHOULD BE USED INSTEAD. 

  THE RATE OF COMPRESSION IS 100 COMPRESSIONS PER MINUTE, for ALL AGE GROUPS.

SINCE THE RATIO OF COMPRESSION TO BREATHS GIVEN IS NOW 30 to 2 , THIS AMOUNTS TO ABOUT 
  3 CYCLES OF CPR PER MINUTE. 
The old rate was 2:15 , but the time to change from giving ventilation to cardiac compression
was a factor in decreasing the amount of compressions given in one minute; at 30:2 ,
there are half as many changeovers . {{ref|ERC}}

==Changing the Color Palette==
The first problem in creating beautiful charts is the choice of colors. Excel only offers 64 colors, and most of them are hideous.

Fortunately, you can change them, and any changes you make travel with the workbook. This means that when your client opens it up, it's going to have your changed colors in it. It also doesn't affect any other workbooks - their colors will be unchanged.

Here is the standard Excel color palette, with very few light colors, which are important for attractive graphics. Alongside is shown an alternative, with many more light colors, arranged in sequence instead of all jumbled up.

[[Image:StdPalette.jpg]]   [[Image:NewPalette.0.jpg ]]

So how do you change them? Click on Tools, Options, then the Color tab. You should see the color palette below.

[[Image:PaletteDialog.jpg]]

Click a color you want to change, and then the button labeled Modify on the right hand side.

Either of the two dialogs below will then come up. You'll see you can flick between them by choosing the Standard or Custom tabs.

[[Image:DualPaletteDialog.jpg]]

The Standard colors let you choose from a much larger number of colors by simply clicking on them. This is all you need, most of the time.

Suppose, however, that you like a color but it is little too dark. Select it, then click the Custom tab. You can then use the slider bar at the right of the rainbow in the middle, to make it lighter.

If you are feeling creative, you can play with the numbers at the bottom to create the perfect color.

If you've gone to the trouble of changing colors and you want to copy them into another workbook, or if you want to use the palette I've created for you in this workbook, it's quite easy.

# Open both workbooks (the one you want to copy from, and the one you want to copy to)
# Activate the one you want to copy into.
# Select Tools, Options, and then the Color tab. You'll see a dropdown labeled &quot;Copy colors from&quot;. Click this and pick the workbook you want to copy from.
# All done. Save.

[[Image:CopyPalette.jpg]]

==Applying Formatting==
Standard Excel charts use strong colors and strong lines. This is probably so they show up clearly in all sorts of situations. 

[[Image:Stdcht.GIF]]

While this approach is understandable, the problem is that it results in charts lacking visual appeal. The best way to correct this is to see the effect of making some changes. Please note that there are many ways to do this, and these changes are not necessarily the best.

[[Image:Cht2.GIF]]

The chart should now look like this.  Let's change those awful colors next...

[[Image:Cht3.GIF]]

The chart should now look something like this…those colors are probably too light, but there's a nice trick we can use to give them some body.

[[Image:Cht4.JPG]]

[[Image:Cht5.JPG]]
Let's keep it fairly simple, so we'll click the One color button alongside

[[Image:Cht6.JPG]]

The chart should now look something like this…the colors have more body
[[Image:Cht7.JPG]]

Note: beauty is in the eye of the beholder. You may prefer to use different colors to start with and not go to all this trouble with special effects. 

There is no suggestion that you do all this for every chart. But the more you know, the more choices you will have when you build your next chart.

Now, perhaps, some subtleties
[[Image:Cht8.JPG]]

[[Image:Cht9.JPG]]

==Examples==
Here is a line chart. 
* the lines have been made thicker, with no markers (which is OK as long as it will be printed in color - if it is printed)
* the colors are a little softer
* the legend has been removed &amp; each line has been directly labeled, which makes it easier to read. (You can do this by selecting the last point of each series and showing the series name as the label - when you've selected the point, select Format Data Point, then Data Labels tab, Series Name checkbox). 
* a vertical grid has been added on the X axis, for every second point.

[[Image:Cht14.JPG]]

Here is a single series bar chart. Note how on the left, the gaps between bars are wider than the bars, which distracts your eye. If you narrow the gap, as on the right, it improves the look of the chart. (Do this by selecting the series, click Options tab, and reduce the gap width). If the bars get too fat when you reduce the gap, you can make the chart narrower until the bars look right.

I feel お早よう, 宜しく, and 有難う are to be written in hiragana, if there's no special reason, because we rarely write them with kanjis at least these days. お早う might be a little help for a lerner since the kanji imply that it's the word used early (早) in the morning, but for the others... - [[User:Marsian|Marsian]] / [[User talk:Marsian|talk]] 12:14, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

:I agree with you; here's the problem we ran into. I originally wanted to set the table up with English, Japanese, and Romaji columns. The Japanese would contain the phrase in hiragana or kanji with furigana. Unfortunately, furigana in tables crashes some versions of Internet Explorer, so I had to take it out. When I substituted a four column table with English, Kanji, Hiragana, Romaji, a reader took it upon him/herself to fill in the Kanji for 宜しく and 有難う, which makes sense because it completes the table.
:I don't want to imply that there are no kanji for these phrases, because there are. But I don't want students thinking that's the normal way to write it, either. So what I'll do is put an asterisk next to the offending kanji and footnote that these forms are rarely used. I hope that works. --[[User:Aaronsama|Aaronsama]] 14:45, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

== when to speak formally or informally ==

The comment that one should always speak informally to social inferiors is not correct. For example, teachers do not necessarily speak informally to students, nor does a boss necessarily speak informally to subordinates. -[[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 03:52, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

:Corrected to &quot;general rule of thumb&quot;

==about the conversation==

I don't suppose 全然 means &quot;Don't mention it.&quot;.

(We probably hedge instead of answer to ありがとう when we talk informally.)

- Sorry,I'm poor speaker of English.

:'''''AMENDMENT XVI.''' The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.''

This book covers federal '''income tax''' in the United States. It approaches the tax system from a legal perspective, not an accounting perspective. Rather than show how to calculate tax liability, it shows which factors lead to tax liability, and how different types of transactions are treated by the Internal Revenue Code.

The Internal Revenue Code requires three income calculations when determining income tax liability:

#'''Gross income''', the actual income the taxpayer receives.
#'''Adjusted gross income (AGI)''', gross income reduced by &quot;'''above the line'''&quot; deductions such as trade and business expenses.
#'''Taxable income''', AGI reduced by &quot;'''below the line'''&quot; deductions such as personal and profit-seeking expenses.

While taxable income is the only amount that matters when calculating final tax liability, the other two values have great significance in the process as well.

==The definition of income==

Section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-I-61.html] puts it broadly: &quot;Gross income means '''all income from whatever source derived'''.&quot; The Code supplies many examples, but provides that the list is not exhaustive. Among its enumerated types of gross income are compensation for services (i.e. wages and salaries), business income, income from dealings in property, interest, rent, royalties, dividends, alimony, annuities, life insurance income, pensions, and a number of other examples.

The simple definition of gross income has led to some questioning of what the word &quot;income&quot; actually means within the text of the statute. The authoritative opinion on this issue is the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[w:Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.|Commr. v. Glenshaw Glass Co.]]'', 348 U.S. 426 (1955), perhaps the most important case in American tax law. ''Glenshaw Glass'' established that income is:

* any undeniable accession to wealth,
* which is clearly realized by the taxpayer,
* over which the taxpayer has complete dominion.

===Accession===

An accession to wealth need not be in the form of money. For instance, if a farmer trades a bushel of tomatoes for an accountant's tax help, the tomatoes are an accession to wealth for the accountant. Such accessions are called '''receipts in kind'''&amp;mdash;goods or services received in exchange for services. Contrary to popular belief, receipts in kind are considered income, and their value for tax purposes is the fair market value of the goods or services at the time of transfer.

An accession need not be in consideration for anything. &quot;Windfalls,&quot; such as prizes and free samples, are accessions to wealth. Even an unanticipated windfall is considered income. For instance, if a taxpayer finds money hidden inside a piano, that money becomes income to them: see ''Cesarini v. U.S.'', 428 F.2d 812 (6th Cir. 1970).

Wealth is affected by assets and liabilities. '''Loans''' are usually not considered to be income because they are not true accessions to wealth: while they provide a tangible asset to the recipient, they offset this asset with an equivalent liability. But a &quot;loan&quot; that is ''not'' offset by an obligation to repay ''is'' income to the recipient. Moreover, if a third party pays off a taxpayer's debt, the taxpayer receives income to the extent their debt was reduced. See ''Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commr.'', 279 U.S. 716 (1929) (employer paying taxes on employee's behalf).

===Realization===

Realization can be thought of as an administrative rule: it serves to clarify ''when'' the taxpayer receives income. The simplest way to conceptualize realization is as the point in time when the taxpayer's property or interests are actually increased.

The Supreme Court used the theory of realization to ban income taxation of stock dividends (splits) in ''Eisner v. Macomber'', 252 U.S. 189 (1920). Because share-for-share stock dividends do not materially affect the assets of the corporation or its shareholders, the Court reasoned that there would be no income to the shareholders in such transactions.

===Dominion===

If a taxpayer sees a $20 bill, but does not pick it up, they have not yet realized any income, because the money is not yet theirs. Once they pick the money up and assert possession of it, the $20 is income to them: they have realized it and assumed dominion and control over it.

Consider a more complicated example: a person signs a long-term lease on a piece of property, then constructs a building on it. They fall behind on their rent and the landlord evicts them. According to ''Helvering v. Bruun'', 309 U.S. 461 (1940), the landlord realizes income amounting to the value of the building in the year of the repossession.

Dominion over wealth is based on practical considerations rather than the considerations of property law. When an accession is legally disputed (or disputable), the '''claim of right doctrine''' comes into play. If a taxpayer receives an amount, claims it as theirs, and has no restriction on their disposition of it, that amount is considered income in the year in which they receive it. For instance, if a taxpayer receives a piece of land and someone else disputes its title, the taxpayer will have income so long as they claim that land as their own. Any income gained from illegal activities is also considered to be income whether the taxpayer's title to it is valid or not.

However, the &quot;completeness&quot; of dominion is compromised if the taxpayer recognizes a legal obligation to return the wealth to its previous owner. Security deposits are one example: because they must usually be paid back, they are not considered income until the recipient is legally entitled to keep them. Advance deposits, on the other hand, are income upon receipt, because they are not accompanied by an obligation to repay.

==Exceptions to income==

===Employment benefits===

Some apparent accessions to wealth are not income because the '''primary purpose''' of the accession is to benefit the taxpayer's employer. A classic example is ''U.S. v. Gotcher'', 401 F.2d 118 (5th Cir. 1968), in which the taxpayer went on a business trip to Germany, all expenses paid by Volkswagen and the taxpayer's employer (an auto retailer). Examining the facts of the case, the court concluded that the trip primarily benefited Volkswagen, not the taxpayer, and was therefore not income to the taxpayer. But the taxpayer's wife also had her expenses paid to come on the trip, and the court ruled that her half ''was'' income, because the benefit of her share of the trip was hers alone and not Volkswagen's.

Besides this primary purpose test, more specific rules covering many types of employment benefits appear in the Internal Revenue Code.

*'''No additional cost services''' provided by employers are not income to employees. Standby tickets for airline employees are one example. Allowing employees to fly in otherwise empty seats does not cost an airline any appreciable amount. On the other hand, providing regular &quot;positive space&quot; tickets to airline employees ''would'' constitute income to the employees, because the service costs the airline money if it has to deny seats to paying passengers.
*'''Qualified employee discounts''', discounts on goods and services that are offered by the employer to its customers, are not income to employees. The Code imposes a maximum discount of the profit on goods and 20% on services: any greater employee discounts are considered income.
*'''Working condition fringes''', services or property that would be deductible by the employee as a business expense if purchased by the employee, are not income to the employee. Examples include on-the-job training expenses, safety equipment, and travel for purely business purposes.
*'''De minimis fringes''', benefits that are too low in value to be reasonably worth accounting for, are not income to employees. Coffee and donuts in an office are a classic example.
*'''Meals and lodging''' provided by employers follow special rules. To be excluded from income, they must be provided on business premises for a &quot;substantial noncompensatory business reason&quot; such as keeping the employee &quot;on call.&quot; Note that in the case of lodging, &quot;business premises&quot; does not refer to location: it means that some sort of business activity must be performed at the place of lodging.

===Gratuitous transfers===

Gratuitous transfers, such as '''gifts''' and '''inheritances''', are excluded from income by the Code. The standard for determining such a transfer is whether it was made &quot;from a detached and disinterested generosity, out of affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses.&quot; If a so-called &quot;gift&quot; is made in consideration or anticipation of a benefit, it loses its gratuitous status and can be considered income. See ''Commr. v. Duberstein'', 363 U.S. 278 (1960) (Cadillac given to contact who provided business leads in the past was includible in income despite being declared as a gift).

Transfers of property incidental to divorce are also treated as gifts under Section 1041 of the Code. To qualify, such transfers must either be within one year after the date of the cessation of marriage, or be &quot;related&quot; to the cessation if made beyond the one-year window.

Severance payments, bonuses, honorariums and other &quot;gifts&quot; from employers to employees are almost always considered to be income, although they may be excluded as fringe benefits as described above. Death benefits to survivors of employees have been a more difficult issue and have split the courts as to whether they should be considered as income.

===Life insurance===

Section 101 of the Code excludes life insurance payments from income, including accelerated death benefits for the terminally ill. There are several exceptions to this rule, mainly to cover obvious loopholes. Among them:

*One cannot exclude payment on a life insurance policy that was coupled with an annuity of equal value, because such an arrangement does not shift or distribute any risk.
*Creditors cannot exclude payment on life insurance policies they take out on debtors to secure repayment of their loans.

===Scholarships===

Scholarships are not income in some situations. To be exempt, they must be paid to degree candidates at an educational institution, and they are only exempt to the extent that they compensate for the cost of tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment. Payments for teaching, research and other services are ''always'' considered income even if they are only paid by reducing the student's tuition.

Loan forgiveness programs receive special treatment under Section 108(f). The discharge of the student's loan debt can be excluded from income, as long as the loan came from the government or an educational institution, contained a provision for forgiveness, and the forgiveness is in exchange for working in &quot;certain professions&quot; or for &quot;any broad class of employers.&quot;

===Social welfare===

Sections 85 and 86 of the Code exclude social welfare payments from income. The exclusion applies to TANF, Medicare, disaster relief, replacement housing payments, and assistance to victims of crimes, among many other types of payments. But unemployment compensation is considered to be income.

An exception to the exclusion is Social Security, which follows its own complicated rules because of its dual nature as a welfare program and investment scheme.

==Special rules==

===Damage awards===

The taxation of damages awarded in lawsuits poses complicated policy issues, but the general rules are:

*'''Punitive damages''' are always income.
*'''Compensatory damages''' may or may not be taxable depending on their nature.
**Damages that compensate for lost income, such as lost profits and back pay, are treated as income.
**Damages that compensate for lost capital, such as property, are not treated as income.
**Damages that arise due to physical injuries are not treated as income unless they are punitive. (This includes compensation to third parties, e.g. for loss of consortium.)
**Damages that compensate for emotional distress are treated as income unless they arise due to a physical injury.

===Conduit situations===

Some taxpayers receive income with the condition that they must pay it to somebody else or for something else. Examples include waitresses who share tips with busboys, political candidates who receive campaign contributions, and funds paying collective expenses for multiple businesses. In most '''conduit''' situations such as these, the money &quot;passing through&quot; the taxpayer is not considered income to the taxpayer, but the taxpayer must be able to prove that the income was received with the condition that it be paid to someone else or for something else.

Note that many corporations are taxed on their profits even if those profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends. This is described in further detail in the Tax Liability chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Template:US Income Tax}}
The previous chapter in this text discussed the broad concept of [[US Income Tax: Income|income]]. Income often arises in the trading of property, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible. The income to a taxpayer from disposition of property is called '''gain''' or '''loss'''. Whether it is gain or loss depends on the '''adjusted basis''' of the property and the '''amount realized''' by the taxpayer in its disposition.

Gains are income to the taxpayer. Losses may be deductible from income, but not always. If losses are incurred by a corporation, or in an individual's trade or business, they reduce adjusted gross income. Nonbusiness profit-seeking losses, as well as some &quot;casualty losses,&quot; are treated as itemized personal deductions.

==Determining gain and loss==

'''Basis''' refers to a taxpayer's expenditure in acquiring property. Over time, the basis is &quot;adjusted&quot; to account for improvements, [[US Income Tax: Business Deductions#Cost recovery|cost recovery]], and other factors. When the property is sold, or when another &quot;taxable event&quot; takes place, its '''adjusted basis''' is subtracted from the '''amount realized''' by the taxpayer. If positive (amount realized exceeds adjusted basis), the amount is a gain. If negative (adjusted basis exceeds amount realized), it is a loss.

For example, a taxpayer might buy a piece of land for $10,000. Its basis thus becomes $10,000. The taxpayer puts a house on the land, at a cost of $40,000. Now, the property's adjusted basis is $50,000: the cost of the land plus the cost of the improvement. If the taxpayer sells the property for $90,000, they realize a gain of $40,000. Conceptually, the other $50,000 does not represent an accession to wealth, because it is wealth the taxpayer already had: they simply shifted its form from cash to property, and did not gain any wealth until they sold the property for more than they paid.

==Determining basis==

When the taxpayer purchases property for cash, basis is easy to determine. Other scenarios pose different problems.

===Financing===

Most real estate transactions, and many purchases of personal property, involve debt financing. When a taxpayer takes out a loan to purchase property, the loan is included in the basis of the property. When the property is transferred, the loan is included in the amount realized ''if'' the recipient takes the loan with the property.

In the first example above, the taxpayer could purchase the land with a $10,000 loan. The basis becomes $10,000 after purchase, and adjusts to $50,000 after the house is built. When the taxpayer sells the property for $90,000, their amount realized is $90,000 if the property is sold subject to the loan, but is only $80,000 if the taxpayer remains subject to the loan. The taxpayer therefore recognizes $10,000 in additional gain if the property is sold subject to the loan. In a sense, the taxpayer receives more income if the buyer takes on the liability for the loan, just as they would receive income if the buyer paid off their loan for them.

===Property as income===

In the first example above, the taxpayer might have received their land in exchange for supplying a service to its previous owner. In that case, the basis in the property would become its fair market value&amp;mdash;the same amount claimed by the taxpayer as income. Assuming $10,000 was the fair market value, this achieves the same result as if the taxpayer had received a $10,000 payment from the owner and then bought the land for that amount.

===Property as an inheritance===

If our example taxpayer received their land as an inheritance upon the previous owner's death, they would not have to declare it as income, and its basis would be reset to its fair market value as of the date of death of the decedent; i.e, the inheritor receives a '''stepped-up basis''' in the assets. There is an alternate valuation date, subject to the rules of IRC §2032, which may be used to value assets.  The alternate date is six (6) months to the day following the date of death of the decedent. The generally cited reason for this rule is that death is not an appropriate time to tax a person's heirs for the gains of the deceased, especially considering that they may be liable for a separate estate tax. (The rules concerning inheritances will temporarily change in 2010 to coincide with the temporary repeal of the estate tax.)

Note that while inherited property is essentially &quot;free&quot; for income tax purposes, '''income in respect of a decedent''' is not. For instance, if a person contracts to sell some property and then dies, the proceeds from the sale will be paid to that person's heirs and will be fully taxable as income to the heirs.

===Property as a gift===

Gifts by a living person follow a different rule from inheritances. Generally defined as a gratutitous transfer of property, the rule regarding gifts is that the basis in the hands of the donor becomes the basis in the hands of the donee. Effectively, the taxpayer is recognizing the previous owner's gain as well as his own. The reason for this rule is to prevent  people from giving property to each other for the sole purpose of resetting its basis and mitigating their gains.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I object to calling a civilization Celts and *Druids*. Druids were members of the priestly class of Celtic society. Also, the Celts covered a large area of Europe, including modern-day France, Spain, Northern Italy and Central Europe.

Also, this is meant to be a book. Don't you think that the answers to each of the subtopics/questions should be in a paragraph format? The answers are IMHO really too brief to make a book.

== Adoption ==

I'm going to adopt this book, and improve it where I can. It seems that no one else is working on it at all. [[User:Canaen|Canaen]] 20:34, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

:You are welcome to do so.  I have been monitoring it against vandalism, but it is something that does needs a subject matter expert, or at least somebody willing to pour some passion into it.  Please keep in mind this is something oriented toward children between the ages of 8 and 12, so try to keep the level of content and vocabulary to something these kids would understand.  Just do the best you can do, and don't sweat it.  Good Luck!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:47, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

::Thank you. [[User:Canaen|Canaen]] 23:19, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

== How far? ==

How far into modern times should we take sections of these articles? I know that this series is on '''ancient civilizations''', but many groups of Celts are alive and thriving today. I've already included bits towards the 17th century or so, but only when it expanded on a point made about ancient Celts. Thoughts? [[User:Canaen|Canaen]] 01:39, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== Incorrect details ==

The article describes the ancient celts as wearing clothing with tartan patterns woven into them. This is incorrect, tartans were introduced by modern celts. The article also describes celts in the Middle ages carrying rifles and pistols, which is nonsense.
: Agreed.  I will remove those sections. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:10, 6 November 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Thank you Sekicho ==

Your work on the US legal pages looks great. I would love to spotlight this kind of polished work, as it would draw positive attention to the site. Nijongo wa shimas ka? That was something like the Japanese that I studied back in college .... Maybe you can give us unofficial legal advice later on on issues like certain ramifications of copyright law. I have one question right now: Is it legal for us to write study guides on this site that reveal the inner structure of the copyright books that they are a guide to? For example, a Seven Habits guide that reveals the chapter order.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Sekicho. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Sekicho~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Business pay income taxes on their '''profit''', whether the business is a major corporation or a self-employed individual. This is achieved by deducting trade and business expenses from gross income (which is '''revenue''' from a business's perpective) to find adjusted gross income.

==Trade and business defined==

Trade and business deductions are provided by [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VI-162.html Section 162] of the Internal Revenue Code, but that section does not define the terms &quot;trade&quot; and &quot;business.&quot; The current definition is provided by the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Commr. v. Groetzinger'', 480 U.S. 23 (1987):

:To be engaged in a trade or business, the taxpayer must be involved in the activity with continuity and regularity. The taxpayer's primary purpose for engaging in the activity must be for income or profit.

The &quot;continuity and regularity&quot; requirement distinguishes trade and business deductions from '''profit-seeking deductions''', which are provided under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VII-212.html Section 212]. Profit-seeking deductions can be claimed for any activity engaged in for income or profit, whether the taxpayer is actively involved or not. The key difference between the two classes is that profit-seeking deductions are '''below the line''', meaning they are applied against AGI, while trade and business deductions are '''above the line''', meaning they are applied against gross income. Profit-seeking expenses must also be '''itemized''', which is described in more detail later in this text, but practically means that they may not always benefit the taxpayer. Trade and business deductions, on the other hand, always apply against the taxpayer's income, assuming the taxpayer has income to deduct against.

==&quot;Ordinary and necessary&quot; defined==

To be deductible, Section 162(a) requires that trade and business expenses be &quot;'''ordinary and necessary'''.&quot; Like &quot;trade or business,&quot; the phrase &quot;ordinary and necessary&quot; is not defined by the statute. The Supreme Court has also failed to provide a definition for the term.

It is clear that ordinary and necessary business expenses exclude '''personal expenses''' and '''capital expenditures'''. Some courts have gone further to indicate that strange or arbitrary expenses are also not deductible.

==Business assets==

===Capitalization===

Many expenses in consideration of assets are classified as capital expenditures, and are not deductible as business expenses. Instead, capital expenditures give a basis to the assets purchased, and that basis reduces the amount of income realized when the asset is sold.

Generally, any expenditure that ''creates'' or ''adds value to'' an asset that will be held for over a year is a capital expenditure. This is not a strict rule: minor assets incidental to a business, such as supplies, materials, furniture and books, may simply be deducted when they are purchased. But all significant assets to be held in the long term must be treated as capital expenditures.

Capital expenditures may also be required for expenses incidental to the acquisition of assets. This was established by the Supreme Court's opinion in ''INDOPCO v. Commr.'', 503 U.S. 79 (1992), which held that the legal and consulting fees for a corporate acquisition are considered capital expenditures. The IRS later established so-called &quot;INDOPCO Regulations,&quot; which require capitalization of expenditures to acquire, create or enhance an intangible asset, as well as all expenditures incidental to such activity.

Improvements to a property are capital expenditures and affect basis. Repairs to property are normal business expenses which do not affect basis.

Because capitalization affects the basis of the asset in question, classifying an expense as a capital expenditure does not remove all of the tax benefit for that expense: capitalization &quot;shifts&quot; the tax benefit forward in time, so that it will be recognized as part of the gain or loss upon sale of the asset.

===Cost recovery===

Some assets have a limited lifespan: they are known as '''wasting assets''' because they lose value over time. Machinery and buildings are examples of wasting assets. Artwork and land, on the other hand, are not wasting assets because their value generally stays constant or goes up over time. Capital expenditures on wasting assets give rise to a type of deduction called '''cost recovery'''.

====Depreciation====

Depreciation is the typical form of cost recovery for wasting assets. It provides a system for gradually deducting the cost of the asset over a fixed period. In addition to being a business deduction, depreciation also deducts from the basis of the asset. This means that a fully-depreciated asset has a basis of zero.

Since 1981, the main method of depreciation has been '''accelerated cost recovery'''. Property placed into service after 1986 is depreciated by the '''Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System''' (MACRS), while property placed into service between 1981 and 1986 is depreciated by MACRS' predecessor, the '''Accelerated Cost Recovery System''' (ACRS).

Under MACRS, each asset is given a '''recovery period''' based on its &quot;midpoint life&quot; as determined by the IRS. The recovery periods are 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years for various forms of personal property, 27.5 years for residential buildings, and 39 years for nonresidential buildings.

Depreciation always starts and stops at the midpoint of each year. A 10-year asset, for instance, receives half a year's worth of depreciation in the year it is purchased, then depreciates normally until year 11, when it receives another half a year's worth of depreciation (which should equal its remaining basis). This '''half-year rule''' is intended to keep taxpayers from benefiting disproportionately if they purchase assets late in the year.

There are two methods for calculating the actual depreciation. The '''straight line''' method is mandatory for real property, but can be voluntarily applied to any depreciable asset. Under the straight line method, the same percentage of the asset's basis is deductible each year. So a 10-year asset with a basis of $100,000 would be deductible by $5,000 in the first year, $10,000 each year from year 2 to year 10, and $5,000 in year 11.

Other assets use the '''declining balance''' method, which provides higher depreciation in initial years but lower depreciation in later years. 15 and 20-year assets use 150-percent declining balance, while other assets use 200-percent (double) declining balance.

====Expensing====

Section 179 allows a limited amount of machinery and equipment to be &quot;expensed,&quot; or deducted immediately. Expensing can be performed in lieu of depreciation, or it can be applied against the basis of an asset and the remainder can then be depreciated normally.

====Amortization====

Section 179 makes a separate cost recovery provision for many intangible assets, including covenants not to compete, franchises, goodwill, government licenses, and trademarks. Such assets are amortizable over 15 years. Other intangibles can be amortized if the taxpayer can prove that they have a limited useful life.

====Depletion====

Depletion is essentially depreciation for natural resources. It applies to mining and lumber operations which are likely to reduce the value of land over time.

====Leveraged tax shelters====

From the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, many investors took advantage of cost recovery to create '''leveraged tax shelters''', investments that provided a high rate of return by generating high cost recovery deductions that were passed on to investors. The classic tax shelter was a piece of real estate financed through &quot;nonrecourse debt&quot;&amp;mdash;a loan secured against the property, such as a mortgage. The investor would put up a tiny portion of the purchase price, and then take cost recovery deductions every year until the property was fully depreciated. Often, they would recover their investment in the form of lower taxes within a few years.

Congress eventually created two rules to block leveraged tax shelters. The '''at-risk limitation''', passed in the Tax Reform Act of 1976, established that the deductible loss of a taxpayer cannot exceed the amount with respect to which the taxpayer is actually &quot;at risk.&quot; The limitation applies to all business and investment activities ''except'' real estate. 

Congress added the '''passive activity loss limitation''' in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Codified at [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-E-II-C-469.html Section 469], the rule states that deductions from passive business activities cannot be used to offset income from other sources. The rule essentially forces taxpayers to separate their &quot;passive&quot; business activities from their personal and &quot;active&quot; business activities, and only apply passive business losses against passive business income.

==Excluded business expenses==

Section 162 renders several types of business expenses non-deductible for &quot;public policy&quot; reasons.

===Penalties===

Fines and penalties for illegal conduct are not deductible under Section 162(f). This rule includes civil and criminal penalties of all kinds, as well as similar private payments such as settlements and restitution.

===Influence===

Lobbying expenses are not deductible under Section 162(e), which bars deductions of expenses to influence legislation, political campaigns, referenda and executive decisions.

Bribery is also not deductible as a business expense. Section 162(c) specifically prohibits businesses from deducting illegal bribes to government officials, although bribes to foreign officials are deductible if they are permitted under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

===Golden parachutes===

Section 280G prohibits deduction of &quot;excess parachute payments,&quot; defined as payments to an executive contingent upon a change in ownership or control of a corporation, when such payments exceed three times the executive's average annual compensation over the past five years.

===Drug trafficking===

Section 280E prohibits deduction of business expenses incurred in illegal drug trafficking.

==Business vs. personal==

Some types of business expenses can be construed as having both business and personal purposes. In such cases, their deductibility is often limited.

===Home offices===

[http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-IX-280A.html Section 280A] generally disallows business deductions for home offices, with a number of exceptions. A home office is deductible if it is exclusively used on a regular basis as the taxpayer's principal place of business, or by the taxpayer's clients for meeting or dealing with the taxpayer.

If a home office meets one of these exceptions, its proportion of the total expenses of the home can be deducted as business expenses. For instance, if the office constitutes twenty percent of the house's floor area, then twenty percent of the utility bills and insurance premiums would be deductible.

===Travel, meals and entertainment===

Business travel, including lodging, transportation and meals, is deductible under Section 162(a)(2) when the taxpayer is &quot;away from home.&quot; &quot;Home&quot; is considered to mean the taxpayer's principal place of business, so this rule disallows deductions for '''commuting''' expenses. If the taxpayer has no such place of business, their &quot;home&quot; is their residence.

Transport, lodging and meals are deductible whenever the taxpayer is spending the night away from home. For trips that do not involve an overnight stay, transportation expenses are deductible so long as they are not commuting expenses between the taxpayer's residence and principal place of business. A doctor, for instance, can deduct the cost of traveling between hospitals and clinics, but cannot deduct the cost of traveling between residence and hospital or residence and clinic. Rev. Rul. 90-23, 1990-1 C.B. 28.

However, there are many restrictions on what employees are allowed to expense and deduct. Most of these restrictions are found in [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-IX-274.html Section 274], which states that the following are nondeductible:

* Tickets purchased above face value (only deductible at face value).
* Skybox tickets (only deductible to an amount equal to the cost of box seats).
* Luxury water travel.

Entertainment expenses not directly related to the taxpayer's trade or business are generally not deductible, as are operating and membership expenses for entertainment facilities, such as sporting and social clubs. But such expenses ''can'' be deducted if they are provided as employee compensation or made available to the general public.

Meals and entertainment provided by employers to their employees are only deductible to 50 percent of their cost under Section 274(n). This restriction does not apply if the meal is considered a ''de minimis'' fringe, or if it is supplied to transportation workers subject to federal hours limits (e.g. aircrews and long-distance bus drivers).

===Vehicles, computers and phones===

[http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-IX-280F.html Section 280F] deals with vehicles, computers and phones, three types of property that are often provided by businesses to their employees, or used by self-employed individuals for their business. Such items are not depreciable under the usual accelerated system unless more than fifty percent of their use is for business. Use by employees must be for the employer's convenience and required as a condition of employment in order for such use to count as business use. &quot;Profit-seeking&quot; use is also not counted as business use.

'''Automobiles''' are subject to additional rules which greatly decelerate their depreciation. However, trucks, vans, ambulances, hearses and all vehicles over 6,000 pounds are not counted as &quot;automobiles&quot; for the purpose of this rule. This means that while a Rolls-Royce must be depreciated over a very long period, a Hummer can be depreciated over a relatively brief period.

===Uniforms===

Business uniforms are only deductible if they are unsuitable for ordinary wear outside the course of business. This leads to some seemingly arbitrary distinctions. The cost of military uniforms, for instance, cannot be deducted when the uniforms can be worn off duty. Fatigues, on the other hand, cannot be worn off duty, and therefore the cost of military fatigues is deductible. By similar logic, a performer can deduct the cost of a unique tuxedo they wear on stage; a lawyer cannot deduct the cost of a suit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cell organelles==
[[File:Differences between simple animal and plant cells (en).svg|thumb|400px|Diagram showing the parts of animal and plants cells. Plant-only organelles are shown in green.]]
[[File:Simple diagram of yeast cell (en).svg|thumb|250px|The organelles of a yeast cell]]
All animals and plants are made up of cells. Parts of cells are called organelles. Organelles common to all cells are:
*A nucleus – It controls the actions of the cell and contains DNA or RNA.
*Cytoplasm – Where chemical reactions occur. Inside the cytoplasm are enzymes which speed up these reactions.
*A cell membrane – It controls the passage of substances in and out of the cell
*Mitochondria - Where respiration takes place

Plants cells have:
*A cellulose cell wall – to keep the structure of the cell
*Chloroplasts – to absorb sunlight energy to make food by photosynthesis
*A vacuole – It stores nutrients and food in the form of cell sap

Yeast cells have:
*A chitin cell wall - to keep the structure of the cell
*A vacuole - It stores nutrients and food

==Cells, tissues and organs==

A group of cells with similar structures and a particular function are called a tissue. For instance, the cells on the surface of a leaf form &quot;pallisade tissue&quot;. Tissues are grouped together to form an organ. A leaf is an organ. Organs are grouped together in organ systems. These form an organism, for example a whole plant.

Organelle   &gt;   Cells   &gt;   Tissue   &gt;   Organ   &gt;   Organ system   &gt;   Organism

Tissues are usually formed from specialised cells. The cells in the pallisade tissue are specialised to perform photosynthesis and so contain many chloroplasts. Some other specialised cells are:

*Guard cells
*Egg cells
*Sperm cells
*Red blood cells

==Diffusion==
[[File:Gas exchange in the aveolus simple (en).svg|200px|thumb|Diffusion occurs in gas exchange; the oxygen in the air diffuses into the blood, and the carbon dioxide diffuses out.]]

Diffusion is the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of a lower concentration. The steeper the concentration gradient, the more rapid the rate of diffusion.

Examples of diffusion are:
*Oxygen (required for respiration) enters the blood through capillaries next to air sacks in the lungs (alveoli) by diffusion
*Carbon dioxide entering leaves for photosynthesis

If you spray a can of air freshener in a room in one corner and have another person sit somewhere else in the room, how come he/she can smell it after a few seconds? The air freshener diffuses throughout the room- from an area of high concentration (the area where you sprayed the deodorant) to an area of low concentration (where the other person is).

==Osmosis==
[[File:Semipermeable membrane (svg).svg|thumb|200px|A semi-permeable membrane doesn't allow things that are too big to pass through. Here it shows the red blood cells and the blue particles are too big to fit through the holes]]

Osmosis is the movement of water from an area of high water concentration (more dilute) to an area of a low water concentration (less dilute) through a partially permeable membrane.

A partially permeable membrane allows water molecules to pass through but not solute molecules, because they are too big. It's like a sieve. Visking tubing is a partially permeable membrane. It is used in dialysis machines.

===Turgor===
Plant cells need to be '''turgid''' (i.e. rigid) to support plant tissues.

If the water potential outside the cell is higher than outside (hypotonic), water moves into the cell, the vacuole expands and the plant cell becomes turgid.

If the water potential outside the cell is lower than outside (hypertonic), water moves out of the cell, the vacuole shrinks and the cell loses its shape and becomes flaccid. A cell which is flaccid (due to water loss from osmosis) is called '''plasmolysed'''. A plant that contains plasmolysed cells is said to '''wilt''' and the leaves droop, collapsing and hanging down from the stem.

An isotonic solution is when the water potential is equal on the inside and outside of the cell.

[[File:Turgor pressure on plant cells diagram.svg|500px]]

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Rhoeo Discolor epidermis.jpg|Before Plasmolysis...
File:Rhoeo Discolor - Plasmolysis.jpg|...and after.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[File:Lilium stoma.jpg|thumb|200px|Real microscopic image of stomata on the underside of a leaf.]]
Turgor is used to control the opening and closing of '''stomata''', the pores on the underside of leaves. The stomata are surrounded by '''guard cells''' that can become turgid or flaccid. Stomata allow carbon dioxide into the leaf and water to escape through evaporation. They can control the rate of water loss from the plant. They also control '''transpiration''' where water loss from the leaves due to evaporation causes the flow of water and fresh minerals up the plant.

{{File:Stomata opened and closed unlabelled.svg/Labelled}}

If an animal cell becomes turgid it can be in danger of bursting because it does not have a cell wall to protect it.

==Active Transport==

Diffusion and osmosis can only work if the concentration gradient is right. Sometimes an organism needs to transport something against a concentration gradient. The only way this can be done is through active transport, using energy produced by respiration. In Active transport, the particles move across a cell membrane from a lower to a higher concentration.

===Examples of active transport===

'''In plants:'''
Plants need mineral salts (e.g. nitrates) for making proteins and growth. Nitrates are at a higher concentration inside the root cells than they are when dissolved in the water around the soil particles. If the plant relied on diffusion alone, the vital nitrate salts would drain out of the cells into the soil. So energy is deployed by the cells to actively transport nitrates across the cell membrane into the root cells, against the concentration gradient.


'''In humans:'''
Active transport takes place during digestion of food in the small intestine. After food has been absorbed by the villi for some time, the concentration of food molecules inside the villi increases, making it impossible for more food to diffuse into the villi. So simple sugars, amino acids, minerals and vitamins are actively absorbed into the villi, from an area of lower to an area of higher concentration

==The Cell Cycle==

At one time, biologists described the life of a cell division after another &quot;Interphase&quot;. During the Cell Cycle, a cell grows, prepares for division, and divides to create two daughter cells, each of which begin the cell cycle.
During the normal cell cycle, interphase can be quite long, whereas the actual division of the cell takes place quickly. Interphase is divided into three phases: G1, S, and G2.
The G1 period is a period of activity in which cells do most of their growing. During this phase, cells increase in size and synthesize new proteins and organelles.
G1 is followed by the S phase, in which chromosomes are replicated and the synthesis of DNA molecules takes place. Key proteins associated with the chromosomes are synthesized during the S phase. Usually, once a cell enters the S phase and begins the replication of its chromosomes, it completes the rest of the cell cycle, including mitosis.
When DNA replication is completed, the cell enters the G2 phase. G2 is usually the shortest of the three stages of interphase. During the G2 phase, many of the organells and molecules required for cell division are produced. When the events of the G2 phase is complete, the cell is ready to enter the M phase and begin the process of cell division.


===Prophase===
The first and longest phase of mitosis, prophase, can take as much as 50-60 percent of the total time to complete mitosis. During prophase, the chromosomes become visible. The centrioles, two tiny structures located in the cytoplasm near the nuclear envelope, separate and take up positions on opposite sides of the nucleus. The centriols lie in a region called the centrosome that helps to organise the spindle, a fanliek microtubule structure that help separate the chromosomes. During prophase, the condensed chromosomes become attached to fibers in the spindle at a point near the centromere of each chromatid.

===Metaphase===
The second phase of mitosis, metaphase, often only lasts a few minutes. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up across the center of the cell. Microtubules connect the centromere of each chromosome to the poles of the spindle.

===Anaphase===
Anaphase is the third phase of mitosis. During anaphase, the centromeres that join the sister chromatids separate, allowing the sister chromatids to separate and become individual chromosomes. The chromosomes continue to move until they have separated into two groups near the poles of the spindle. Anaphase ends when the chromosomes stop moving.

===Telophase===
Following anaphase is telophase, the fourth and final phase of mitosis. In telophase, the chromosomes, which were distinct and condensed, begin to disperse into a tangle of dense material. A nuclear envelope re-forms around each cluster of chromosomes. The spindle begins to break apart, and a nucleolus becomes bisible in each daughter nucleus. Mitosis is complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Human Digestive System==

[[Image:gcsebioldigest.gif|right]]Digestion begins inside the mouth, where chewing does 2 things - makes the food easier to swallow and increases the surface area (this helps to speed up digestion). Also inside the mouth, amylase (for digesting starch) can be found, produced by the salivary glands. The gullet then carries food from the mouth to the stomach by its muscular squeezing action called peristalsis.

The stomach does a number of things, including:
*pummels and churns the food
*produces protease enzymes to digest protein
*produces hydrochloric acid which kills bacteria and gives the ideal pH for protease to work.

The liver produces bile which emulsifies fats i.e. breaks them down into small droplets for a larger surface area. This will increase the rate at which the fat is digested by lipase. Bile also neutralizes the acid produced by the stomach to provide ideal alkaline conditions for enzymes in the small intestine. The gall bladder stores the bile made by the liver until it is needed. 

The small intestine produces amylase, lipase and protease. The pancreas, a pistol shaped organ, produces the enzymes amylase, lipase and protease and releases them into the small intestine when needed. The enzymes are used to fully digest the food molecules, so that they are small enough to diffuse into the bloodstream. Food molecules diffuse in the small intestine, which is ideal for this purpose. The small intestine walls are very thin so that there is a short diffusion pathway. It is long and folded with villi to increase surface area. There is a rich blood supply to maintain a steep concentration gradient for diffusion.

When all the useful products have diffused into the blood, the remaining waste reaches the large intestine where the majority of the remaining water is absorbed into the blood stream. Finally the waste products leave the body in the form of faeces through the anus.

[[image:gcsebiolgut2.gif|right]]It is useful to know that the ''small intestine'' consists of the ''duodenum'', jejunum and ileum and the ''large intestine'' consists of the caecum, colon and rectum in that order. The appendix is a small cul-de-sac at the base of the caecum. Only the terms in italics are needed by most GCSE boards.

===How digestion works===

The working of the digestive system is based on two things:
# Muscular Action – The gut is a muscular tube and its squeezing action is very important. It helps to break up the food into very small pieces with a large surface area for enzyme action to take place. It also helps the chemical breakdown of the food, mixing it with various digestive juices, which break down its molecules. The muscles also move the food along the gut from one area of chemical digestion to another. 
# Enzyme Action – enzymes are chemicals which speed up (catalyse) other reactions. They do not actually take part in the reaction or change it in any way except to make it happen faster. Each type of enzyme acts on a specific type of food.

==Enzymes==
Enzymes are proteins. They are made inside cells. Most of them work inside the cell, but some (e.g. digestive enzymes) work outside the cell. Enzymes are biological catalysts. A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction. It does not change the final products. A catalyst is not changed by the reaction – therefore it can be used over and over again. 

===How Enzymes Work===

In an enzyme the reactants (things on the left of the equation) are called substrates. An enzyme is a large molecule. It has an indentation on the surface called the active site. The active site has a specific shape which is exactly the right shape for the substrates. When the substrates fit into the active site, they bind to it forming an enzyme/substrate complex. The reaction occurs, and the products are released. This is known as the lock and key hypothesis – the enzyme is the lock and the substrate is the key.

===Key features of enzymes===

# They change '''substrates''' to '''products'''.
# They are proteins.
# They are catalysts. Tiny amounts of enzyme can be used over and over again.
# They have '''specificity''', acting on particular substrate molecules.
# They are pH sensitive, most work best at pH 7. Proteins can be damaged by high or low pH.
# Enzyme catalysed reactions go faster as the temperature increases.
# Enzymes give the fastest reaction at an '''optimum temperature'''.
# They are inactivated at temperatures over 40 degrees C because proteins are denatured at these temperatures so the active site is misshapen.

===Enzymes in Digestion===

Enzymes are very important in digestion. They help act as catalysts to break down the big molecules (which cannot pass through the gut wall into the blood) into smaller ones (which can diffuse into the blood). Starch, proteins and fats are big molecules. Sugars, amino acids and fatty acids/ glycerol are much smaller.

'''Amylase''' enzyme converts starch into simple sugars e.g. glucose. &lt;BR&gt;
'''Protease''' enzyme converts proteins into amino acids. &lt;BR&gt;
'''Lipase''' enzyme converts fats into fatty acids and glycerol. &lt;BR&gt;
Bile is not an enzyme. However, it emulsifies the fats, breaking it down into tiny droplets. This provides a much larger surface area for lipase enzyme to work on, so that fat is digested more quickly.

===Other enzymes===

'''Catalase''' is an enzyme found in cells that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.

==Key Ideas==
*Large food molecules must be broken down (using enzymes as a catalyst) so that they are small enough to diffuse through the gut wall into the blood.
*The small intestine is long, filled with bile, has thin walls and a rich blood supply - these features all speed up diffusion.

==Test Yourself==
#  Name 2 ways in which chewing helps digestion.
#  What organ carries food from mouth to stomach, and how does it do this?
# Where is bile a) produced? and b) stored?
# Name the 3 large molecules that cannot diffuse into the blood.
# Name the 4 small molecules that can diffuse into the blood.
# Name the 3 enzymes involved in digestion.

==Answers==
# Chewing aids digestion by making food easier to swallow and providing a larger surface area for amylase (produced by the salivary glands) to work on.
# The '''gullet''' carries food from the mouth to the stomach by '''peristalsis''', a muscular squeezing action.
# Bile is produced in the '''liver''' and stored in the '''gall bladder'''
# Starch, proteins and fats cannot diffuse into the blood
# Glucose (or another simple sugar), amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol.
# Amylase (for starch), protease (for protein) and lipase (for fats)

      <text xml:space="preserve">An operation is commutitive if and only if the order does not affect the result.

For example, addition is commutitive for the real numbers; thus, if &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; are both real:

&lt;math&gt;a + b = b + a&lt;/math&gt;

An operation that is not commutitive is subtraction over the reals; ie, the following is not true:

&lt;math&gt;a - b = b - a&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the situation one is stranded in the desert, there are two essentials to surviving: finding shelter away from the sun and staying hydrated. There are a few sources of '''water in the desert''', which are listed in this article.

==Staying hydrated==
Foremost, if you have bottled water with you, you should not ration it. Instead, drink it all at once &amp;mdash; people have been found dead with water remaining in their bottle. Assuming there are no bodies of freshwater around (such as a river), plants, the air, and animals are the only source of water. Some plants, especially some species of cactus, contain water in a form that can be tapped and drunk directly. More often, however, the moisture in a plant cannot be obtained by any method other than the use of a still, which can retrieve water from the air.


Water can be added to the surrounding air by placing plant parts in the still (but outside the area for capturing the pure water).  A simple still can be constructed of plastic sheeting, some rocks, and a cup. Simply dig a hole deep enough to hold the cup, with a couple of inches to spare. The wider the still, the better, since it will have more surface area for water to condense on. Place the cup in the center of the hole and cover the hole with plastic (clear plastic is better than opaque, since it absorbs less heat).  Use rocks to secure the edges of the plastic and place a small rock in the center of the plastic sheet to pull it down so that water condensing on the plastic drips into the cup.  Such a still does not produce enough water for a person to live on indefinitely, but even a little bit of water can improve one's chances of survival. 

If there is no available liquid and you are severely dehydrated, drinking urine can become an extreme survival option.

==Not Overhydrating==
Any activity or situation that promotes heavy sweating can lead to water intoxication when water is consumed to replace lost fluids. Persons working in extreme heat and/or humidity for long periods must take care to drink and eat in ways that help to maintain electrolyte balance. Even people who are resting quietly in extreme heat or humidity may run the risk of water intoxication if they drink large amounts of water over short periods for rehydration.

==What not to drink==
Drinking alcoholic beverages will slake your thirst temporarily, but due in part to the diuretic nature of alcohol, will leave you more dehydrated than before.  Since alcohol is a poison, the liver aggressively removes it, and a lot of water in the process.  Alcohol and water bond covalently, and boiling alcoholic drinks will not remove the alcohol any faster than it will remove the water. Drinking saltwater will lead to water being drained from the body, because of osmosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Template:US Income Tax}}
This chapter deals with the deductions that apply to individual taxpayers. The first set of deductions covered are those that are '''above the line'''&amp;mdash;subtracted from gross income to reach AGI. The other deductions for individuals are '''below the line'''&amp;mdash;subtracted from AGI to reach taxable income. When calculating below the line deductions, the taxpayer can either use a '''standard deduction''' provided by law, or elect to take '''itemized deductions'''.

==Above the line deductions==

The main type of above the line deduction is for '''business''' and '''employment''' expenses, which are discussed in the chapter on [[US Income Tax: Business Deductions|Business Deductions]]. Several other deductions are allowed &quot;above the line&quot; even though they are not business-related. These deductions are listed in [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-I-62.html Section 62].

===Property losses===

Ordinary losses from the sale of property, as detailed in the chapter on [[US Income Tax: Gains and Losses|Gains and Losses]], are deductible &quot;above the line.&quot; This makes them preferable to capital losses, as they can be applied directly against income rather than going through the complicated calculations for capital gains taxation.

===Interest===

[http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VI-163.html Section 163] provides that interest payments are generally deductible. However, interest on &quot;personal&quot; loans, with the exception of home mortgages and student loans, is not deductible.

Interest is generally defined as &quot;rent for borrowed money,&quot; so some payments labeled as &quot;interest&quot; may not be considered &quot;interest&quot; for tax purposes. Likewise, some payments are considered to be &quot;interest&quot; despite not being called by that name: &quot;points&quot; and loan origination fees, for instance, are deductible over the term of the loan. Rev. Rul. 69-188, 1969-1 C.B. 54.

&quot;Investment interest,&quot; interest for property held for investment (e.g. stocks, bonds, and land) can only be deducted to the extent of net investment income; disallowed investment interest is carried forward and treated as investment interest the following year.

Some interest payments are nondeductible due to the passive activity loss limitation, described in the section on [[US_Income_Tax:_Business_Deductions#Leveraged_tax_shelters|leveraged tax shelters]] in the previous chapter.

===Alimony===

===Educational expenses===

Educational expenses are deductible if they maintain or improve skills used in a present trade or business, and if they do not qualify an individual for a new trade or business.

This means that the ''type'' of education does not determine deductibility: the ''circumstances'' of the education do. In ''Ruehmann v. Commr.'', T.C. Memo. 1971-157, a student who entered an LLM program after four months of employment as an attorney was allowed to deduct the cost of his degree. But in ''Wassenaar v. Commr.'', 72 T.C. 1195 (1979), a student who entered an LLM program immediately after law school was denied a deduction for its cost, on the grounds that he was not employed as an attorney at the time he paid for the classes.

One exception to this rule is when a person takes a job contingent upon completing an educational requirement, as is the case when teachers are hired subject to completing a required degree, or when law school graduates are hired subject to passing the bar exam. In these cases, the cost of their education is not deductible because it is considered a &quot;minimum education requirement&quot; that qualifies the individual for their trade or business.

===Student loan interest===

==Personal exemptions==

As of 2005, the personal exemption is $3,500 for the taxpayer and each dependent.

Under Section 151(d)(3), personal exemptions &quot;phase out&quot; over a threshold income of $145,950 for single taxpayers and $218,950 for married couples (2005). They fall two percent for each $2,500 or fraction thereof over the threshold, reaching zero at income levels of $268,450 and $341,450 respectively.

A dependent is defined in Section 152 as someone who is reliant on the taxpayer for more than 50% of their support, and either living with or closely related to the taxpayer. Non-resident foreigners cannot be dependents unless they come from a country contiguous with the United States.

==Standard deduction==

==Itemized deductions==

===Medical expenses===
Medical expenses can be deducted to the amount of those expenses which the tax payer has not been reimbursed for and that they exceed 7.5% of the taxpayers adjusted gross income (AGI).  (i.e. 100 dollars of unreimbursed expenses for a person with an AGI of 1,000 can be deducted in the amount of 25 [100-1,000*.075])  These deductions are different when calculating Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and are subject to phaseout in higher income brackets.  See IRS form 1040 Schedule A instructions for more details.

===Investment interest===

===Wagering losses===

===Casualty losses===

Casualty losses include losses due to theft, accident, and other &quot;sudden&quot; incidents. A casualty loss may be the loss of an entire piece of property, or it may be in the form of damage to that property.

Casualty losses ''do not'' include:

* Losses compensated for by insurance. But a property owner may claim a casualty loss if their property is covered by insurance but no claim is pursued. ''Hills v. Commr.'', 691 F.2d 997 (11th Cir. 1982).
* Property confiscated under color of law.
* Losses due to the owner's gross negligence (e.g. setting a house on fire during a domestic dispute). However, loss due to the owner's ordinary negligence (e.g. dropping a diamond ring down the drain) is deductible as a casualty loss.
* Unrealized declines in property value. See, e.g., ''Chamales v. Commr.'', T.C. Memo. 2000-33 (2000) (neighbors of O.J. Simpson not allowed to claim casualty loss for decline in property value due to disorder in neighborhood following Simpson murders).
* Expenses incidental to the loss, such as legal expenses.

Each casualty loss is only deductible to the extent it exceeds $100, and total casualty losses are only deductible to the extent they exceed 10% of AGI.

Casualty loss can never exceed adjusted basis of the property. If casualty loss is taken for damage to property, the adjusted basis of that property is reduced by the amount of the loss.

===Profit-seeking expenses===

===Charitable contributions===

Charitable contributions are deductible under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VI-170.html Section 170]. The section imposes a limit on deductible contributions of 50 percent of AGI for individuals (less in the case of certain organizations) and 10 percent of taxable income for corporations.

The donor must have a '''donative intent''' in order for the contribution to be deductible. The analysis of donative intent is similar to the analysis used in determining whether a payment is a gift: the purpose of the donation must be &quot;detached and disinterested generosity.&quot; See ''Hernandez v. Commr.'', 490 U.S. 680 (1989) (payments to Church of Scientology for &quot;auditing&quot; sessions were non-deductible ''quid pro quo'' exchanges). If a good or service is provided in exchange for the contribution, the contribution is only deductible to the extent it exceeds the fair market value of that good or service. But a ''de minimis'' consideration, worth less than 2 percent of the contribution or $50, need not be subtracted from the donation.

When property is donated to a charity, the value of the donation is considered to be the fair market value of the property, not its adjusted basis. Because of this rule, many taxpayers choose to donate appreciated property to charity, rather than sell it and pay taxes on the gain.

===Foreign, state and local taxes===

Many non-federal taxes are deductible under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VI-164.html Section 164]. The main categories are foreign, state and local '''income taxes'''; foreign, state and local '''real property taxes'''; and state and local '''personal property taxes'''. Other types of taxes, such as sales taxes, are generally not deductible.

'''Tax credits''' are applied at the last stage in the tax computation process. They directly reduce the actual tax paid by the taxpayer. This makes them highly preferable to equivalent deductions.

==Personal credits==

===Adoption credit===
You may be able to take a tax credit for qualifying expenses paid to adopt an eligible child (including a child with special needs). The adoption credit is an amount subtracted from your tax liability. Although the credit generally is allowed for the year following the year in which the expenses are paid, a taxpayer who paid qualifying expenses in the current year for an adoption which became final in the current year, may be eligible to claim the credit on the current year return. The adoption credit is not available for any reimbursed expense. In addition to the credit, certain amounts reimbursed by your employer for qualifying adoption expenses may be excludable from your gross income.

For both the credit or the exclusion, qualifying expenses include reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, traveling expenses (including amounts spent for meals and lodging while away from home), and other expenses directly related to and for which the principal purpose is the legal adoption of an eligible child. An eligible child must be under 18 years old, or be physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself or herself. The adoption credit or exclusion cannot be taken for a child who is not a United States citizen or resident unless the adoption becomes final. An eligible child is also a child with special needs if he or she is a United States citizen or resident and a state determines that the child cannot or should not be returned to his or her parent's home and probably will not be adopted unless assistance is provided. Under certain circumstances, the amount of your qualified adoption expenses may be increased if you adopted an eligible child with special needs.

The credit and exclusion for qualifying adoption expenses are each subject to a dollar limit and an income limit.

Under the dollar limit the amount of your adoption credit or exclusion is limited to the dollar limit for that year for each effort to adopt an eligible child. If you can take both a credit and an exclusion, this dollar amount applies separately to each. For example, if we assume the dollar limit for the year is $10,000 and you paid $9,000 in qualifying adoption expenses for a final adoption, while your employer paid $4,000 of additional qualifying adoption expenses, you may be able to claim a credit of up to $9,000 and also exclude up to $4,000.

The dollar limit for a particular year must be reduced by the amount of qualifying expenses taken into account in previous years for the same adoption effort.

The income limit on the adoption credit or exclusion is based on your modified adjusted gross income (modified AGI). If your modified AGI is below the beginning phase out amount for the year, the income limit will not affect your credit or exclusion. If your modified AGI is more than the beginning phase out amount for the year, your credit or exclusion will be reduced. If your modified AGI is above the maximum phase out amount for the year, your credit or exclusion will be eliminated.

Generally, if you are married, you must file a joint return to take the adoption credit or exclusion. If your filing status is married filing separately, you can take the credit or exclusion only if you meet special requirements.

To take the credit or exclusion, complete Form 8839 , Qualified Adoption Expenses, and attach the form to your Form 1040 or Form 1040A .

'''Boneheadmx''' is currently a student at University of California, Berkeley and a former Bowles Hall President. I joined Wikipedia in the spring of 2005, because I am very interested in the sociological aspects of an internet community such as this one in which members participate by sharing useful information in a cross-referenced database. I am also a member of various other web communities such as Discogs.com, Photo.net, and Beer Advocate.com.

I enjoy learning very much, and I like to browse this site very often, looking up many new articles. I really enjoy learning random pieces of trivia, and enjoying the fine writing of various users exhibited by many of the articles.

The study of '''Social Deviance''' is the study of the violation of cultural norms in either formal (criminal) or informal (deviant) contexts.

Social deviance is a phenomenon that has existed in all societies where there have been norms. There are two possibilities for how an individual will act in the face of social norms; conform or violate.  There are implicit social norms and explicit social norms.  Explicit social norms are not necessarily laws (such as a sign at a computer lab that says food and drink are prohibited).  In reality, there is often a blend of conformity and deviance in the ways people behave.  Rarely if ever does a person deviate from or conform to all norms.  Furthermore, some behaviors in themselves reflect both conformity and deviance at once.  Consider breaking the speed limit, which is technically a legal violation, but which is also conformist, particularly on freeways where motorists &quot;go with the flow.&quot;  That is a critical feature of deviance, conformity, and norms.  Relativity abounds.  That is, norms can change over time (e.g. women in the paid labor force), depend on situational context (e.g. laughing at a party as opposed to doing so at a funeral), depend on statuses (e.g. an adolescent blowing up neighbors' mailboxes as opposed to an elderly woman doing so), and any number of other factors.  But it's not all relative.  There are forms of deviance (and certain norms) that are about as universal as anything in the social sciences can be, such as when one maliciously harms a child.  In light of the way we think about norms, deviance, and conformity, many thinkers throughout history have tried to explain the causes behind deviance.

==A Word About Theories==
Social science theories are just what they they are: theories. The philosophers who have come up with these theories believe in them because they have made a set of the assumptions by their observations and they have made conclusions based on these assumptions. However, as the reality of the world is open to interpretation, each theory describes the world in its own unique way. No theories are wrong if they are supportable by facts and observations. These theories you will learn are just ways that thinkers have used to describe the world around them. Just remember that you do not have to agree with a particular theory, but you must be able to understand all theories in order to make a conclusion about the world in which you live.

The best way to understand a particular ideology is to think as a philosopher would think. How would believers of a particular theory present a solution to a particular problem? Thinkers in different schools of thought will come up with different answers because of the differences in their assumptions. Make sure you understand how different theorists think.

Most importantly, understand that these theories are constantly being altered, borrowed from, and in some of the cases, discredited completely. Theories are not rules to the world but rather ways to look at the world. A person can look at the world in different perspectives and can combine different assumptions of theories to describe it. No matter how different theories can be, they can almost always be combined because they are almost never mutually exclusive.

==Contents==
# [[Social Deviance/What Is Crime And Deviance|What Is Crime And Deviance?]]: Before we can understand what crime and deviance are, it is necessary to know that crime and deviance are changeable in nature. John Hagan in his book ''Crime And Disrepute'' states two theories of describing crime before presenting the most commonly used approach. {{stage short|100%|January 1, 2006}}
# [[Social Deviance/Early Theories|Early Theories]]: Before the three classical branches of the sociological approach to deviance, there were early theories in criminology that attempted to define and explain crime in the context of the individual (instead of in the context of the individual as a part of the whole of society). These early theories helped to pave the way for modern sociological explanations of deviance. {{stage short|75%|January 1, 2006}}
# [[Social Deviance/Structural Functionalism|Structural-Functionalism]]: The structural-functionalist school of sociology is concerned with macro-level explanations. Therefore, this school is interested primarily in how norms and institutions fit in the study of deviance. {{stage short|25%|January 1, 2006}}
# [[Social Deviance/Symbolic Interactionism|Symbolic Interactionism]]: The symbolic interactionist school of sociology came up as a counterpoint to the structural-functionalist view. This school is interested primarily in individual-to-individual interactions by way of communication through symbols (the symbolic, subjective definitions of objects and ideas in the world; definitions that may hold different meanings for different individuals). {{stage short|00%|January 1, 2006}}
# [[Social Deviance/Power Conflict|Power Conflict Theories]]: Sociologists and philosophers who take on the power-conflict perspective believe that structural-functionalists and symbolic interactionists do not adequately take into account the use (or abuse) of power within societies. Many thinkers of this school tend to base their explanations of crime from the division of classes and the unequal distribution of power among different groups within the context of the larger group of the society. {{stage short|25%|January 15, 2006}}
# [[Social Deviance/Social Control|Social Control]]: Social control refers to the various means used by a society to bring its members back into line with cultural norms. {{stage short|00%|January 1, 2006}}

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dna-webmaster. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dna-webmaster~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey.  I suggest you remove large parts of or split up [[Business Integration Engine 6.0.4 File Tree Structure]].  It's currently by far the largest module in wikibooks.  Would help myself, but I don't know what BIE is. Thanks! &amp;mdash;[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 07:59, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

== Agree - unsure what to remove ==

Yes, I agree with you, but at the moment I'm a bit unsure what to remove first. 

First, let me explain what BIE is: BIE lets you move data between applications that are unable to exchange data by themselves and create automated workflows. Let's say you work at a doctor's office, which is able to output statistical information as comma separated file (CSV) from a proprietary electronic patient record system (EPR), but is unable to adhere to a national XML standard for such information in your country. BIE can automatically convert the CSV file to an XML version, then the XML version can be mapped field by field to the national XML standard. The links between fields can have macros associated with them, to convert strings from lower to upper case, mathematical or logical operations, regex replacement and so on. BIE handles transport between the different systems as well. See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Business_Integration_Engine_or_BIE for the main article.

Second, Brunswick WDI have chosen to include all dependencies in the download package, just install and run &quot;out of the box&quot;. Among the dependencies or plugins in BIE parlance are JBoss, Java SDK, and so on.

Third, the problem with BIE is that although BIE is released under the GNU GPL, Brunswick WDI has chosen to sell documentation and services from day one. This would not be a problem if it were not for the fact that BIE has not been updated for a year, and that users who bought the documentation was not very satisfied in the first place. That is why I've started this documentation initiative. Nobody - or very few outsiders - except Brunswick WDI know how the dependencies interact at the moment. I'm pretty sure that most of the files from Java SDK can safely be removed - I just don't know which files MUST be kept yet.

To make a long answer short: yes, I will clean up the File Tree Structure file, as soon as possible, but I think that will be in January. I have removed the Java SDK entries, hoping that this is just a standard installation. I think BIE 6.0.4 or it's dependencies depend on this particular version of Java SDK.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most Seikos have a relatively simple code--The first letter of the serial number is the last digit of the year, the second is the month, using N for November, D for December.   If the production dates of the movement are known, and they were made for less than 10 years this works well.  Some movements that were made for a long time are more difficult--The 7009 for instance was made longer than 10 years, so the exact date can be difficult.  One clue can be the number of digits--From about 1960 to 1967, Seiko used 7 digit serial numbers.  In 1967 and 68, they used both 7 and 6 digit numbers, and from 1969 on, used exclusively 6 digit numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
Getting a new version of the Mac OS feels like christmas for most Mac fans. As soon as you finish installing, you'll see an immediate increase in speed and discover lots of cool new features. But if you feel daunted by the task of installing Tiger and are putting it off, this appendix is made for you! It lays out in plain English what you need to do, and will let you get installation over with in about a half hour.

=Types of Installations=
Before you begin, you should pick how you're going to install Tiger. There are four choices, although depending on your current configuration, you won't be able to choose all of them. The choices are:

*'''Upgrade Install''' - An Upgrade Install takes a copy of Mac OS X 10.2 or 10.3 (Jaguar or Panther) and turns it into a copy of Tiger, by going under the hood and modifying only what's been changed since your current Mac OS version. It eliminates all extra installation headaches... but upgraded copies of Mac OS X tend to be slightly buggier than copies installed via either of the two methods below.
*'''Archive and Install''' - Archive and Install shrink-wraps your current OS, be it an early version of Mac OS X or even (heaven forbid) Mac OS 9, stores it in a folder, and puts a fresh copy of Tiger in its place. Among Mac users who are &quot;in the know&quot;, this is the most popular choice. You will need to tie up a few loose ends afterwards, though, so weigh the extra hassle against the slightly inferior reliability of an Upgrade Install.
*'''Erase and Install''' - Erase and Install completly obliterates the hard drive you install Tiger on and starts fresh - it's like getting a new Mac. Obviously, you'll want to make sure that any important files are backed up first.
*'''Basic Install''' - A Basic Install puts a copy of Mac OS X on a blank hard drive. If your hard drive isn't blank, then you can't choose this option.

=Pre-Installation To-Do List=
Before you install Tiger, make sure you've done these five simple things.

#'''Printing this Appendix''' - You can't connect to the Internet while installing Tiger, so it's important that you print this Appendix before installing so you can refer to it as you go. It's very simple to do this; in almost all web browsers, choose File &gt; Print and press the blue Print button in the dialog box that appears.
#'''Checking the Weather''' - Yes, you read that right. You should check the weather before you install Tiger and make sure conditions are good. High winds, snow, or thunder could knock out power to your house, and a power outage during installation is '''not''' a good thing.
#'''Plugging In''' - If the computer you're installing Tiger on is a laptop, plug it in, since installing Tiger will consume a lot of power.
#'''Repairing Permissions''' - This trouble-shooting procedure essentially smooths out any wrinkles that may have formed over time in the UNIX underpinnings of your current Mac OS, prepping it for being moved, deleted, or upgraded. The process of repairing permissions is simple and potentially beneficial. To Repair Permissions:
##Open Disk Utility in the Applications &gt; Utilities folder.
##Select your internal Hard Drive in the sidebar along the left.
##Click the &quot;Repair Disk Permissions&quot; button.
##Enter your administrator credentials.
##When the repairs are complete, quit the Disk Utility.
You don't need to do this if you are doing the Erase and Install option.
#'''Backing Up''' - It's a good idea to back up your important files before installing Tiger. While the chance that something goes wrong during installation is tiny, it's not worth the risk when you can easily back up. Have every user of your Mac burn a copy of their entire Home folder to a CD or DVD before you install, or do it for them. While CD Burning is described in Chapter 4, here's a quick tutorial on backing up a home folder:
##Open System Preferences' CDs &amp; DVDs pane and make sure that your Mac is set up to &quot;Ask what to do&quot; when you insert a blank CD or DVD (depending which you intend to back up on to).
##Log into the user you want to back up's account.
##Insert a Blank CD into your disc drive.
##Open the Users folder on your main hard drive.
##Drag the user's home folder onto the Blank CD's icon on the Desktop or in the Finder window's sidebar.
##Choose &quot;Burn Disc...&quot; from the Finder window and follow the dialog boxes' instructions.
##Repeat steps 2-6 for all other users.

=Installation=
==The Tiger Box==
Tiger comes in a little black box with a big chrome &quot;X&quot; logo on the front. Open up the box and take a peek inside. You'll find:

*The Tiger Disc - A black DVD in a paper sleeve.
*A Trial Version of iWork - A small gift from Apple, this is Apple's iWork productivity suite, minus the secret code included with the boxed version that keeps it running past 30 days.
*A card or two advertising some other Apple products.
*Another card explaining how to buy an AppleCare warranty for Tiger.
*A hard copy of the license agreement you agree to when you install Tiger.
*An &quot;Installation and Setup Guide&quot;, which is similar to this guide, only not nearly as well-written and helpful.
*A black &quot;Getting Started&quot; booklet, essentially an illustrated list of new features in Tiger.

==Starting the Installer==
Take the black Tiger DVD out of its protective paper sleeve and put it in your Mac's DVD drive.
{{Info|'''NOTE:''' If your Mac doesn't have an optical drive capable of reading a DVD, Apple has an exchange program in place that will let you trade in your one DVD for four Tiger CDs. You may also install with an external DVD drive, or with Target Disk Mode.}}

It should appear on your Desktop as a special black disc. The disc contains PDF versions of some of the printed material in the Tiger box, an &quot;Install Mac OS X&quot; application, and a folder called &quot;Xcode Tools&quot;.

Double-click on the &quot;Install Mac OS X&quot; application, and the Installer Starter application opens.

{{Yellow_Warning|'''WARNING:''' By pressing the blue &quot;Restart&quot; button, you temporarily plunge your computer into the Mac OS X installer, a very slow and stripped-down version of Mac OS X that actually runs from the Tiger DVD. While you can turn back and quit the installer later on, it's best to continue from here only if you're pretty sure you want to install Tiger. You will not be able to connect to the Internet while you install, so this is your last chance to print this appendix.}}

Click the Restart button, and your computer will shut down and restart from the DVD in your drive. This is a slow and laborious process due to the fact that CDs spin much slower than hard drives, so don't panic if your computer takes a very long time to start.

==The Introduction and License==
{{Info|'''NOTE:''' If you change your mind halfway through installing, you can quit and return to your current Mac OS at any time by choosing &quot;Quit&quot; from the Installer menu in the menu bar, clicking &quot;Startup Disk&quot;, choosing your system folder, and clicking &quot;Restart&quot;.}}

After selecting a language, the first thing you'll see is a simple welcome page. Click the continue button at the bottom. The next thing you see is the contract you agree to by installing Mac OS X. Read it if you'd like to, press &quot;Continue&quot;, and say that you agree. Remember that you have a hard copy of this contract, or &quot;license agreement&quot;, which came in the Tiger box.

==Choosing a Destination==
The next step is choose the volume (disk) you want to install Tiger on. Most of the time, this will be your computer's internal hard drive, which is usually called &quot;Macintosh HD&quot;. Click the disk so that it's circled and click the &quot;Options...&quot; button.

==Choosing an Installation Type==
On this sheet, you must select which type of Installation you wish to perform. The choices were explained at the beginning of this guide.

*Upgrade Install - If you want to perform an Upgrade Install, make sure that &quot;Upgrade Mac OS X&quot;  is selected and click OK. You'll need to be currently running Jaguar or Panther in order to do this, otherwise this option won't appear.

*Archive and Install - If you want to Archive and Install, select &quot;Archive and Install&quot; from the list. You then must choose whether or not you wish to copy all of your settings into Tiger, which you probably do. Click OK.

*Basic Install - If you want to perform a Basic Install, select &quot;Install Mac OS X&quot; from the list and press OK. If you already have a copy of Mac OS X on your hard drive, this option won't appear.

*Erase and Install - If you want to Erase and Install, select &quot;Erase and Install&quot; from the list and press OK. yeah

==Customizing the Installation==
Now you must choose exactly what gets installed. You have two options: go with Apple's picks, or pick and choose components yourself. We'll assume you want to pick the components yourself, since it's generally worthwhile.

Click the &quot;Customize&quot; button. You'll be given a list of components with checkboxes for toggling each one on and off.

*Essential System Software - This is the stuff that ''will'' be installed no matter what. That includes the Tiger system and all of the extra apps that come with it, like Dashboard and Automator.
*Printer Drivers - Printer Drivers are the bits of software that let your Mac connect to various printer models. By clicking the flippy triangle next to this item, you'll see specific brands that you can choose to install or ignore. Without printer drivers for a brand, you can't install any of that brand's printers without going hunting on the Internet for drivers. If you're squeezed for disc space, you might want to skip the brands you don't think you'll use, but otherwise, it's generally a good idea to have all of these drivers handy.
*Additional Fonts - Another good pick, you probably already have these fonts installed in your current version of the Mac OS, although you won't have them under Tiger if you uncheck this box. Fonts take up next to no space, and having a few extra fonts handy will help you spice up your documents and presentations a bit.
*Language Translations - Clicking the flippy triangle next to this item reveals a list of languages that you can use Tiger in. Removing the translations you think you're least likely to need will save disc space and speed up your installation. Please note, however, that it's fun to try using a computer in an obscure language from time to time, so you may want to leave a few extra translations in just for fun.
*X11 - This is a tool that lets UNIX nerds run certain graphical UNIX applications under Mac OS X. It isn't covered in this wikibook, and if you don't know what it is, you definitely don't need it.

==Leap of Faith==
At this point, it's time to make up your mind once and for all.

If you want to install Mac OS X, click &quot;Install&quot; or &quot;Upgrade&quot; (the wording depends on which Installation type you chose). Once you do this, you ''cannot'' quit the installer. Make sure that if you have a laptop, it's plugged in. If you don't want to install Mac OS X, you can return to your current Mac OS by choosing &quot;Quit&quot; from the Installer menu in the menu bar, clicking &quot;Startup Disk&quot;, choosing your system folder, and clicking &quot;Restart&quot;. 

==Your Mac's Turn==
Once you press install, your Mac will get to work on copying, moving, deleting, and modifying all of your system files, slowly building a copy of Tiger on your hard drive. This process takes fifteen minutes to a half hour, so go ahead and make yourself a snack while you wait.

==Finishing==
When Tiger is finished installing, restart your computer.

=The Setup Assistant=
Depending on how you installed Tiger, you may be serenaded by a little program called the &quot;Setup Assistant&quot; when using Tiger for the first time. After the snazzy introduction movie finishes playing, this app will guide you through the process of setting up your Mac.

{{Mac OS X Tiger/Book Box|'''BACKGROUND:''' The introduction movie is a famous part of the Mac experience, and a different movie is used in each Mac OS version. The music for Tiger's movie is a song called &quot;Bytecry&quot; by the artist &quot;Weevil&quot;. Incidentally, the song is availible on iTunes for 99 cents.}}

{{Info|'''NOTE:''' Your Mac is already set up, you say? You can quit the Setup Assistant at any time just like any other app.}}

==Transferring Files==
==Creating an Account==
==Setting up the Internet==
==Setting up Mail==

=Post-Installation To-Do List=
As soon as your Mac comes to, you'll probably want to explore Tiger's new features immediately. However, you'll have to do two things first.

==Run Software Update==
Choose  &gt; Software Update to add the latest updated features, bug fixes, and security enhancements to your copy of Tiger.

==Remove Previous System==
if you chose to Archive and Install, then your old Mac OS is sitting in a folder called &quot;Previous System&quot;. Drag this folder into the Trash and empty the Trash to remove your previous OS once and for all.

== Denominations ==

I think three branches is really stretching things thin.
There are certainly types of Christians who do not fit any
of those three categories.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations


[[List_of_Christian_denominations]]

Also, there are Christian Denominations that do not believe in the relatively new theological construct of Sin, for instance.

== The goal of Christianity goes beyond personal transformation ==

Christianity is different.  Christians claim that their leader is alive -- in fact, God.  So we do seek personal transformation, but as a byproduct of God's presence.  Many Christians content themselves with &quot;being a good person and going to a good place when I die&quot;, but misunderstand God's intention.

Although being a &quot;better&quot; person is good, trying to be so based on rules of behavior has failed spectacularly.  In fact that is the very core of what is popularly called Phariseeism.  Jesus came to put an end to humankind's independence from God.  We can't be virtuous apart from ongoing fellowship with God, even if we have an exhaustive (and exhausting) set of rules.  The reason is because our inmost being when in rebellion against God's moment-by-moment leadership lacks the power and purity to choose well.  Selfishness always reemerges.

The Bible, Christianity's authoritative statement, says that we began in close relationship and ongoing communication with God, acknowledging God's lordship, or mastery.  We rejected God's direction and disobeyed, forsaking the place we were designed by God to occupy, and Jesus came to restore us to that place of tremendous priviledge.

Jesus came with the intention not to make us good, but to make us His.  Once His, He will personally lead us and then our choices will be transformed.  Jesus said, &quot;apart from Me you can do nothing,&quot; and &quot;Come to Me . . . take my yoke upon you and learn from Me . . .&quot; indicating a personal partnership with God is essential to God's plan for us.

I've written a small book called The Big Picture that I'm considering submitting that lays out my response as a Christian to the &quot;big&quot; questions.  It deals with this more thoroughly.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey boneheadmx, just letting you know that I'm trying to get the economics and intro to economics books deleted, but I'm putting a link to [[Political Economy]] on the [[Wikibooks:Economics bookshelf]]. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 17:55, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

The politcal economy module is starting to look pretty good. Let me know if you need any help with it. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 18:50, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

Unfortunately I don't know much about political economics- actually before I looked it up, I didn't really know what it was. If you'd like to help me out, my plans are pretty much to get rid of these books: [[Microeconomics]], [[Macroeconomics]], [[Introduction to Economics]], and [[Principles of Economics]], and consolidate them into 4 new books: [[Principles of Microeconomics]], [[Principles of Macroeconomics]], [[Microeconomic Theory]] and [[Macroeconomic Theory]]. These 4 books correspond to the 4 most common college economics classes. Before moving any material around, though, I'd like to create some kind of skeleton for the books, and decide exactly what should be included in each book. Apart from that, I'd like to categorize different aspects of economics, and decide which subjects should get an entire book, and which subjects should be included in one book. My ongoing &quot;list&quot; of economic subjects can be foud here: http://dettoaltrimenti.pbwiki.com/FrontPage Any feedback on my list would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 20:58, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

The cover and contents looks good! You seem to have a knack for knowing the order in which topics should go in a book. Before the new year, I'm going to try and start the 'principles of macroeconomics' book, and pull the information for macroeconomics, intro to economics, and principles of economics. I would really appreciate any help putting the TOC in order and making sure I'm covering all the topics I need to. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 18:55, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

Hi there, my name is Martin M. Elissetche. I'm a PhD student at the University of Maryland and the creator of a social science dictionary located at www.socialsciencedictionry.org. I wanted to know if I could place a copy of your book on my web site or whether you prefer if I just link to it. Please let me know what you think at info@socialsciencedictionary.org. Cheers, m.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Boneheadmx. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Boneheadmx~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Concurrent Clean ==

[[w:Clean programming language|Concurrent Clean]] is a general-purpose purely [[w:functional programming language|functional programming language]]. This Wikibook is meant to be a companion Part I of [http://wiki.clean.cs.ru.nl/Functional_Programming_in_Clean Functional Programming in Clean]. &quot;Concurrent&quot; refers to Clean's ability to run the same process on several computers, similar to Ada. The language is often just referred to as Clean.

'''About Clean'''


'''1.1 The Language Reference Manual'''

The language manual can be found at the [http://wiki.clean.cs.ru.nl/Documentation Documentation] page of the [http://wiki.clean.cs.ru.nl/Clean Clean website].

'''Programming in Clean'''

'''2.1 Getting Started'''

The Clean compiler can be found here [http://wiki.clean.cs.ru.nl/Download_Clean]. Please register, as requested, though it is not necessary (you can click on &quot;Download clean&quot; on the left.) The .7z package is the quickest to download for Windows programming, if you have [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-zip]. Then, get Part I of [http://www.cs.ru.nl/~clean/contents/Clean_Book/clean_book.html Functional Programming in Clean]; get the 1-up PDF version if you plan to study from the computer.

Unzip the package in the directory of choice, and start the Clean IDE. It will ask to integrate into your operating system (basically, being put into the registry so Windows recognizes it exists); click &quot;Yes.&quot; To make a &quot;hello world&quot; program, select File-&gt;New File and select your file name, in this case &quot;hello.icl&quot;. The file name MUST be the same as the module name. Then, type:

module hello

import StdEnv

Start = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;

The name after &quot;module&quot; must even be the same case as the name hello.icl; Clean is case sensitive, i.e. &quot;start =&quot; doesn't work, &quot;while Start =&quot; does. &quot;import StdEnv&quot; loads the standard library, and is required in every Clean program; other libraries can be loaded as well. Both top lines are implied in Clean source code seemingly lacking them. &quot;Start =&quot; defines what is actually executed.

Now a project must be made. Select File-&gt;New Project, and name your project hello.prj, only that will work. After that, click on the hello.icl window so that it is active, and select Project-&gt;Set Main Module. Now, on the toolbar, select the Update and Run icon (it looks like a window flying to the right.) It will create a DOS terminal with &quot;Hello, world!&quot; displayed. Press any key to exit.

==Question on which template to use on image for copyright==

Image in question: [[:File:HornWagnerLongCall.png]]. I generated this image of this music - do I release this into the public domain (template &quot;PD-self&quot;)? Richard Wagner, long dead, has released this into the public domain according to current law - should I use template &quot;PD&quot; instead? Or should I use both templates?

==Where to report wiki spammers?==

[[Special:Contributions/221.196.142.68|221.196.142.68]] has spammed 3 sites with commercial links  and am not sure  what is the procedure?

:You can report all vandalism on the [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress|vandalism in progress]] page.  If you have time, then you can try dealing with it yourself if you want.  Leave the user a message on their talk page asking them to stop.  If they continue, give them a second, then a third warning.  If they still continue to vandalize after the third warning, then you can report them to an [[Wikibooks:Administrators#List of administrators|administrator]], and they will probably block their IP address. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]] 16:51, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Stick of Butter ==

''Copied from [[Cookbook:butter]]'':  I don't understand the term sticks for butter, how many grammes or ounces is this?

1 stick butter  	 1/2 cup  	 4 ounces  	 113.4 grams  	 8 tablespoons

http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/BritishEquiv.htm

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 20:59, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)
The term 'stick' describes butter and margarine as packaged in the United States:  One package is one pound of butter,  wrapped (in waxed paper or just paper, sometimes aluminium foil) in 1/4 pound (4 oz.) blocks, 4-to-a-package, the four blocks or sticks are additionally wrapped in a nice shiny commercial package.  The term 'cube' of butter refers to the same (4 oz. weight/8 packed, level tablespoonsfull) of butter as well.  We use lots of packaging in the U.S., alas.  One advantage to the sticks-type packaging is that there are markings on the side (of the sticks wrapping-paper) that show measurements... to measure 4 tablespoosnfull, one cuts on the line marked 4 tablespoons.[[User:Pedant|Pedant]]

== Dial-by-letter ==
I have noticed some phone numbers which contain letters, like &quot;1-800-THE-BOOK&quot;. What are these numbers and how can I dial them from Europe? It looks like an American custom, right?

Possible answer:

The 1 indicates to a local land line telephone in the US that you would like to use your default long distance carrier to make a call or you can replace the first numeral one with a code for a different long distance carrier. (For my cell phone the 1 is optional because there is only one carrier.) In short, the 1 tells your telephone network that you want to call a land line outside the area code your own cellphone is located in (i.e. long distance call)

The next three numbers are the area code and in your example is &quot;800&quot; which is a special area code meaning that the recipient of the call will pay the toll charges in the U.S. and Canada. Typically businesses pay for an 800 number that is forwarded to one of their regular business lines or to a call center.

The letter system is a standard. There is a picture on wikipedia under telephone. Q and Z are not part of the system but they are on my cell phone. Most european cell phones (mobile phones) have the letters on their number keys, as well as many new land-line phones. (Cell phones need them so you can type in text messages a.k.a. SMS messages)

2 a b c &lt;br/&gt;
3 d e f &lt;br/&gt;
4 g h i&lt;br/&gt;
5 j k l&lt;br/&gt;
6 m n o&lt;br/&gt;
7 p (q) r s&lt;br/&gt;
8 t u v&lt;br/&gt;
9 w x y (z)&lt;br/&gt;

NOTE: In the US, &quot;0&quot; or Operator was also &quot;Z&quot; on some rotary dial phones.&lt;br/&gt;

To dial 1-800-THE-BOOK:

You know it's a US number, so dial the international access code in your country (i.e. the number you have to dial so the network knows you're making an international call. e.g. &quot;00&quot; in Germany, different for other countries), then the country code (&quot;1&quot; for the U.S. '''(*)''' ), followed by the area code (city code, but often refers to several cities), which is 800, followed by the numeric equivalent of each letter as described in the previous answer.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''(*)''' Please note that this is a different &quot;1&quot; from the &quot;I'd like to make a long distance call&quot;-1 (long distance prefix). From outside the U.S. you always have to specify an area code, so there's no need for a long distance prefix. Instead, this &quot;1&quot; tells your local telefone network in which country the called phone is located. &lt;/small&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

THE-BOOK would then be 843-2665

Most 1-800 numbers cannot be dialed from outside the United States, try to find the alternate number.&lt;br/&gt;
I got this from the Barnes and Noble website:&lt;br/&gt;

''Please call 1-800-THE-BOOK (1-800-843-2665) between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. ET, 7 days a week, and we'll answer your questions. If you are calling from outside the United States, dial 201-272-3651.''

I found that many companies (ATT, for example) have their 800 numbers available locally - i.e., ATT's collect call number here is 1-800-CALL-ATT; in Germany and the Netherlands, it was something similar - a toll-free city code followed by CALL-ATT

I've found that 1-800 numbers work from the UK, but they're not free. In most cases, a female voice (i assume recorded by the carrier such as AT&amp;T) informs you that 'calls to this number may not be free'.

Maybe the reason Barnes &amp; Noble have a different number is because they pay per-incoming-call on the freephone number?

== King Lear ==
What is the source of the devils Edgar makes reference to in King Lear? Is it available online?

They're generally references to Old Testament Devils, I don't quite remember the exact names but some of them at least can be looked up in the [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/ Catholic Encylopedia]

== Self-Help ==
I have the feeling that there should be some good PD or otherwise reusable self-help
references available, not only pre-1915 (some of those are already in Wikibooks) but also
by caring people who want to get out the good word; help for addicts, for one.  Does 
anyone know of such resources?  Perhaps via a local community center / support group?  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 22:18, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== Music Scores ==
This may be a MediaWiki question, but I was wondering if it is possible to use lilypond formatting to create music excerpts withing a document similar to how it is possible to do math markup. I found one project, [http://www.wikisophia.org/wiki/Main_Page WikiTeX], That seems to have added this functionality onto MediaWiki. Would anyone know if this could be added to WikiBooks? It would make things incredibly easier. Thanks!

:See: [[Meta:Music markup]] and http://wikisophia.org/wiki/Wikitex#Music . I have no idea why this is not a standard feature yet (its real neat; click on the sheet music to listen to it!). Respond to [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2004-December/026670.html my recent Wikitech-l post about this] so that the developers know this is important. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 06:28, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Inclusion of new public domain material ==
I am currently writing in the school of philosophy and I would like to include links to classic works which are, no doubt, in the public domain. For example, I would like to include an excerpt from Hesiod's Theogony, translated by Hugh G. Evelyn-White (died 1924). What I would like to know is if I should make a copy of the whole book and include it in wikibooks, or just copy the excerpt, or include a link to an external page where the book can be found. Thank you very much for your attention, ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 23:47, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC))

: I'm not certain, but I assume you should copy the whole book into [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page:English Wikisource], include the excerpt into your book, with a link to the document on wikisource. --[[User:Lbs6380|Lbs6380]] 00:51, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

:: Thank you very much, ([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 23:30, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC))

== Hosting your own Wiki ==
Is there a step-by-step guide on how to create and host your own Wiki using MediaWiki software? --[[User:206.45.175.211|206.45.175.211]] 02:20, 2 Jul 2005 (UTC)

: Get the latest mediawiki package and unpack it on your webdir. Access your website using the browser and go to the directory on your site where you unpacked mediawiki. It will give you instructions on how to go on. If you have problems, remember that google is your friend...

==Centering a heading properly==
Headings in the form &lt;nowiki&gt;==&amp;lt;center&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/center&amp;gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt; don't line up with titles in &amp;lt;center&amp;gt; tags outside of = headings. Is there a way around this, other than the ugly hack of using six &amp;amp;nbsp's? Also, the &quot;Add new question&quot; link above is broken.

==Can't these books be offered in an easily downloadable format?==

I think it'd be really useful and in the interests of Wikibooks to offer each book as a pdf or text file or ebook or similar with an easy link in the top right of the table of contents of each book or something. Sure its important that people get the most up to date  version and to contribute what they can online, but for the essentially complete texts, like the conciousness studies one, I think it'd be a good idea to offer the book as a download

: Creating PDF's requires some effort. I think the better solution is to make printable versions of books (they're automatically updated) like in [[How To Build A Computer]] or [[Python Programming|Programming:Python]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:59, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

:: The best solution would be to suggest to the MediaWiki foundation that they update their software to include a &quot;Print this page and all sub-pages&quot; feature. This would allow you to print a book, a unit, a chapter, a section, etc. of any book formatted using the [[Wikibooks:Slash convention|slash convention]]. The next step would be to allow it to output to .pdf, .odw, or .rtf. Just my 2 cents. --[[User:Aaronsama|Aaronsama]] 16:11, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

::: You know, if you let something to be done automatically, many errors may occur. Creating print versions of book does not take long - and you have to take into consideration, that most books don't use slash convention. Also many people think this naming style is not good. I think for practical reasons manual creation of printed versions is the only possiblity. It's not as hard as it looks like. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:26, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

::::For books that don't follow the slash convention, one could create a sub-page for &quot;This book on one Web page.&quot; This would be a compound document that transcluded all the other pages, in the order they appear in the TOC, in a form like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
{{:Sample book}} &lt;!--Title page and TOC--&gt;
#Appendix: GNU Free Documentation License &lt;!--As an added line to the TOC; style may vary--&gt;
{{:Sample book/Chapter 1}}
{{:Sample book/Chapter 1/Subpage 1}}
{{:Sample book/Chapter 2}}
{{:Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

::::However, it would also be good to put a page break (which would render on the printer, but not on the screen; is there a code for this?) between sub-pages, and suppress module TOCs when they're redundant. Also, this should be done only once the module structure has stabilized, since that is the one type of change that would require a manual update to this page. (However, it would probably be possible to create a bot to make this type of page out of a TOC page, and perform updates.) [[User:Seahen|Seahen]] 22:04, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

== Special character input ==

Why doesn't Wikibooks have a menu at the bottom of the edit page for inserting special characters (diacritic marks, greek/cyrillic letters, etc.) like Wikipedia and Wiktionary do? More importantly, how can I get that feature added? --[[User:Aaronsama|Aaronsama]] 16:14, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

: Done. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:26, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

::By itself, I would have to say no.  There is a new project proposal on the Wikimedia Meta Wiki called [[m:Proposals for new projects#WikiScores|WikiScores]] that could use your support if you are interested in this concept.  I especially like the Lilipond proposal as an addition to Media Wiki, which would allow you to edit a score and then have the MediaWiki software generate a PNG file which would display the traditional notation for some music, together with perhaps generation of a Midi file as well.  

::There is no problem if you publish a Wikibook about folk music (keeping in mind the GFDL restriction and that all contributions have copyright clearance) that happens to have perhaps a few original songs as a sort of example, but Lord Voldemort is correct that this is not a forum for simply publishing poetry or music.  If you want to write a textbook that covers music theory with some original musical examples to demonstrate styles, that would be not only welcome but encouraged.  Or examples of types of poetry that could be used in a textbook.  Keep in mind that this is much harder to write than you may think to start out with.

::As far as other language versions of Wikibooks, the policies are very similar but on some of the more obscure languages there may be quite a bit more lattitude (like Tongan or Maori).  A critical component there is that Wikimedia projects are also trying to help preserve the linguistic culture of those languages, especially when there are very few speakers.  In those cases, an original composition may be the only way to get content in that language except for translations from other languages.  For more widespread langauges like French or German, you will find Wikibooks (and other Wikimedia project) policies to be very similar to the English websites with just a few exceptions based on cultural issues like the German prohibition of a swastika, or French cultural heritage issues.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:30, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

We are still in the process of trying to set up printed materials here, and this is an ongoing discussion in a number of areas.  You can help participate with this discussion on this page: [[Wikibooks:Wikibook Press]].  With [[Wikijunior]] moving towards its final stages of completion on a couple of book modules, including some grant requirements on money already spent that needs a physical printing as one requirement, this is going to be be done sooner than later, most likely some time in the early part of 2006.

As far as &quot;purchasing&quot; an on-line course covering something from Wikibooks, you are free to do that without charge and can freely copy anything with no restriction, as long as you follow the requirements of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]].  This is a general license very much similar in philosophy and spirit to the GNU General Public License that is used by computer software like the GNU/Linux operating system, and you don't even have to tell us if you are using it, although a quick note to the author is generally appreciated, especially for things like Wikibooks where we really don't know who is using the stuff we have written.   Everything here on Wikibooks has been written entirely by volunteers who simply love learning and education for learning's sake, and have some unique knowledge they want to share with the rest of the world.  I hope that you enjoy your experience here on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:02, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

My own opinion on this is that they should not be in Wikibooks, but that is something that is best saved on the VfD (Votes for Deletion) page to express the specifics of that thought.  If you think something is inappropriate for Wikibooks, please read [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] and try to follow the various suggestions on that policy page.  Even though it is written as a suggested policy, it is pretty much the current procedure for getting things accomplished here on Wikibooks.  We try to discuss things like this as a community and attempt to remove controvercial content when it comes up.  Another place to look for guidelines on something like this is [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]], which is often cited during VfD discussions.  You can also bring this to the attention of the Wikibooks community at the [[WB:RR|Staff Lounge]].  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:20, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

:No, unfortunately you have to register for a new account here at Wikibooks. You can use your same name from Wikipedia if it is available though. For example, I use the same name here and at WP.

==Providing a PDF version of a book.==

People are beginning to modify the text of Religions And Their Source (and maybe some of the companion Parts to the series). This is great and was hoped for.

However, differing opinions are replacing original statements and making some parts difficult to follow. When I, or another reader/administrator (thanks again, kwhitefoot) find them, we can move appropriate parts of the additions to the discussion page (and leave a note saying that this has been done). This may become too time-consuming to continue, and the series may become useless as a text to promote discussion and learning if this is not continued. (I have placed a note on the Introduction pages of the series asking for opinions to be placed in the discussion page, but this is not being done.)

Those who want to follow the basic justification for the facts and ideas presented may like to read the original, unmodified, version of the text. I have a PDF version of this. Is it possible and permissible, for this PDF version to be offered by Wikibooks? If yes, then can someone tell me what to do to make it accessible. Thanks. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 14:58, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

: How much space does PDF version occupy? I think if it is reasonably large, there would be no problem with uploading it to Wikibooks. Click &quot;Upload file&quot;, upload PDF and link to it using &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Media:filename.pdf]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (haven't used it but should work).

== can i write information from book i purchased to make it available to all ==

Hello .I first like to appreciate your efforts for making books available to those who cannot purchase.I would like to contribute by adding information from books I purchased.for example I got Software Engineering book by roger pressman with me. Can I write the information in that book here so that persons who cannot purchase it can read it here?. It would be very much useful to persons in need.

::Try to read up on the concept of '''''[[w:Fair Use|Fair-Use]]'''''.  The best thing you can do is to perform scholarly research, including making references to earlier books like the one that you mentioned.  That is called a citation, and is encouraged as a matter of fact.  If you have ever written a term paper for a class report, try to keep the citations at a similar sort of standard.  If the text you are referring to is available under a copyleft license, you can add the whole text into Wikisource, but it seems unlikely given the history of the textbook publishing industry, and specifically that particular author.  &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that ideas can't be copyrighted (well... as long as the judge understands copyright in that manner).  If you express the idea from a textbook like this in a new way, that is considered an original composition. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:07, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

== English as a Foreign Language ==
Hi:

I would like to produce an interactive course to learn English as a Foreign Language. Because I work with multimedia and in order to make use of all these fantastic possibilities I was wondering if wikibooks provides the alternative to upload swf files, mov and flv files, apart from images and sound.
Thank you. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:Mrossetti|Mrossetti]] ([[User talk:Mrossetti|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mrossetti|contribs]]) 20:24, 21 January 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

:Because it is not a [[Help:Uploading files|PNG, GIF, JPG, or SVG image]], what you probably want to use is [[Commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]]. Commons is a repository of free (like [[GNU Free Documentation License]]) images and other multimedia, for use in all Wikimedia projects, including English Wikibooks. You upload to Commons, and it works as if you uploaded to every Wikimedia project.

:However, Commons seems to only allow ogg files (see http://www.xiph.org). So I was surpised to find a MIDI file, [[:File:wikinewstop.mid]]. &lt;s&gt;I am posting to [[Commons:Project:Village pump#Allowed file formats]] to ask Commons if they allow swf, mov, or flv.&lt;/s&gt; Note, however, that you should use '''NO file formats with patents in the United States''' - this means that MPEG is not allowed, because we do not want to force users to [http://www.mpegla.com/ pay MPEG licensing fees]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:31, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

:I found '''[[Commons:Project:File types]]''', which says what to use. Ogg is on the list, but swf, mov, and flv are not. If you want to use them, they compress reasonably, and they are not encumbered by US patents, then maybe you should ask the [[Commons:Project:Village pump]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:47, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;Open-content&quot; vs. &quot;free&quot;? ==

Why does Wikibooks refer to itself as ''open-content'', rather than ''free'' as does Wikipedia? I think free is clearer as well as more striking. If you don't buy that argument, I think we should follow the convention set by Wikipedia. Anyway, any insight into how it got that way, and/or how to go about changing it? --[[User:Tetraminoe|Tetraminoe]] 08:21, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

:: But it would be too long then. I'm not free software or free-something fanatic, so open vs. free is irrelevant problem for me.

:::If Wikipedia is the free encyclopedia, and Wikinews is the free news site... But I'll admit that &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open content&quot; are mixed pretty, well, freely. But I still think &quot;free&quot; is more consistent as well as better. --[[User:Tetraminoe|Tetraminoe]] 11:57, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

:I would personally prefer '''Open-content''' to '''Free'''. I think the terminology is best understood with respect to software, and thats where the concept really took off. Often to retain interest in their products, companies offer older versions free and charge a fee for their latest/newest versions. The software, old or new, is not available for tinkering, and that makes it proprietary. They retain the [[Wikipedia:Copyright|copyright]]!! On the other hand, most of linux-based software or all of wikipedia/wikibooks is open-content, and therfore subject to modifications by ''anyone''. One of the criteria for modifying the content is to keep it ''open-content'' and that forms the basis for [[GFDL]] - the [[Wikipedia:Copyleft|copyleft]] concept! Therefore material that is free need not be open-content but that which is open-content is necessarily free. This made me realise that contents in both [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia|wikipedia]] and [[Wikipedia:Wikibooks|wikibooks]] are ''open-content'' and not just ''free''.

== Contents Bar ==

Hy there,

this site {{bad link|Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas}} uses a Contents Bar.

How can i create one of those ?

Miguel Albano

:Very good question.  This Wikibook is using a template to add this bar.  To see how that is done, look at {{bad link|Template:Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas/Header}} for more details.

:Writing templates can be tricky because there are some more unique syntax issue that go into them which are beyond the scope of basic editing here.  For some further in depth content about template writing, see [[meta:Help:Template]]

:Still, these templates are pretty cool, and add some good eye candy to pages, making it easier for people reading the content to know what else is available.  There are many different styles to do this, so look around on Wikibooks to get an idea on how to do this.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:22, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Where to put my book? ==
What bookshelf does my book [[Coding Divert Sockets]] belong in? --ness

:In an attempt to help out new users...especially as Wikibooks grows and the difficulty increases in deciding exactly where a new Wikibook ought to be put in various categories, I created the [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] to help with the classification of new books.  Ultimately I want to see all new Wikibooks put in a simple request for classification and a team of volunteers who like to classify stuff to go through the effort of adding a Wikibook to the various bookshelves, with cross references as appropriate.  This whole project is just starting, however, and we are not quite prepared to deal with all of the requests that are likely to come that way at the moment.

:For the moment, I would likely suggest the [[Subject:Information technology|Information technology bookshelf]] if this is going to be more hardware oriented or perhaps [[Subject:Computer software|Computer software bookshelf]] under the Linux sub-section if this is just an API documentation book.  At the moment, we suggest the original authors try to do a best fit for these books at the moment, but the bookshelves are often in flux with content moving from one to the other.  We are also trying to do Library of Congress classification as well as Dewey Decimal for subject grouping, but that is going to be another very interesting effort by itself.

== future of fuel cell and adsorption techiniques ==

hi i am interested to know which field is having a greater scope in the coming future.whether it is the fuel cell or the adsorption technology.

:There are so many factors that go into a question like this that you really can't come up with a difinitive answer.  I have seen technologies with a huge potential, such as VRML, go totally bust due to either a mistake in the way it was implemented, lousy marketing, or legal difficulties that keep it from getting developed completely.  Video Laser Discs are another example that didn't take off as a mass consumer product until it was retooled as a DVD with considerable thought into how it would be put together and getting the significant interested parties agreeing on what the real requirements were.  Fuel cells are definitely in this situation right now, as even the application of fuel cell technology is being debated right now.  Is it going to power automobiles?  Cell phones? Houses?  And what fuel is it going to use?  Hydrogen?  Natural Gas (aka Methane)?  Alcohol?  Gasoline? (yes, that is being discussed by some fuel cell researchers.)

:To answer a question like this, you also need to pare down the question to what is really being asked here.  There are energy collection and energy distribution issues related to what the future is going to bring with this as well, including vested interests that may or may not want to see significant changes in the current energy distribution infrastructure as well.  This is where a legal framework needs to be considered as government entities who support one technology over another are going to see different rates of progress for a giving tech as it is being researched.  And it is possible that something like fuel cell research could be overshadowed by yet another energy production technology in the future, like a successful consumer-grade fusion cell or even more exotic energy production ideas like a practical zero-point energy cell (in theory something like a D-cell battery that could power your house, car, and everything you could use for an entire lifetime.)

:If I had to make a guess, I would suggest as an approach to this topic to instead look at where the money is being spent.  Discount heavily government spending and concentrate on energy production techniques that require private investment alone avoiding any goverment spending.  And especially look for changes in R&amp;D spending for that technology compared to itself, not the rest of related energy concepts.  It is not a perfect method, but generally people are only going to be putting their money into something they feel is going to have a realistic chance of making some money back.  Time has also shown that the people who really make money off of a technology are not those who take the first steps, but usually groups that sees the mistakes made by those who came before and come in a little bit later... just not too much later.  This can be either a new start-up or an established company, although start-ups tend to have more flexability.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:27, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

== Bookshelfing ==

How exactly do I add a book to a bookshelf? I'm just curious, mainly.
&lt;br/&gt;[[User:Eagleguy125|Eagleguy125]] 22:40, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:I'm actually in the middle of trying to build an infrastructure to get this accomplished.  By far the best way to get started after you have created a new Wikibook is to add the book to [[:Template:New]], which will get the attention of the rest of the Wikibooks regulars that you have created this Wikibook.  This also acts as an advertisement on the main page to hopefully bring other people who are interested in this topic into your new book projects.

:Ideally, once the book has been added to this list of new Wikibooks, there will be a group of people who like to catalog stuff that would go and put this new Wikibook onto the proper bookshelf and classify the Wikibook.  At the moment we are still lacking in people who are interested in doing this task (at least in large numbers) so you may have to go through the effort of adding it to a bookshelf yourself.  To do this, find the bookshelf that you think is most appropriate for the content you are writing, and add it to the list.  This is a case of helping to '''be bold''' and simply make changes around here because it is useful and needed.  I know that is intimidating for a new user, which is why we are trying to make it easier.

:One other approach that you can do is to add the template markup tag of '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{cleanup-link}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' somewhere inside of the main page of your Wikibook.  This automatically adds this Wikibook to [[:Category:Not linked Wikibooks]], which is monitored by the administrators of Wikibooks and alerts interested helpers for Wikibooks to put the book on a bookshelf.  This may take a couple of weeks before your book is put on a shelf, but it will eventually happen once this template has been put onto your project.

:If you are really interested in helping out with classifying Wikibooks and help organizing the bookshelves on a larger level, I would recommend that you get involved with the [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]], which will eventually be the central place to both search for and classify Wikibooks onto bookshelves.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:24, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

What I did to fix my blunder was to go back in history find the content and then copy and past into newly titled page.

I also tryed to find info on changing location and name of pages or moduels but the FAQ with that title was blank?

== math book titles matching their immediate category name ==

if, for example, i wish to add a new book on algebraic number theory entitled &quot;Treatise on algebraic number theory&quot;, am i obligated to put it under a certain sub-category of 'mathematics', such as 'number theory'?  

also, it is confusing for me to encounter a book named after a category, such as a book entitled 'number theory' or 'algerba', when most printed books do not have titles that exactly match their subject category!

so, to summarise, my questions are two-fold:

# do i have to put a book under a certain agreeable categorical structure?
# why are almost all math books that i have encountered in wikibooks have their titles as same as the immediate category name they belong?  eg. a book entitled 'A-level mathematics' belonging to 'A-level mathematics'.

: I am convinced that there is no one perfect cataloging system, especially for books.  In part because of this, I'm trying to go through and even establish a reasonable cataloging system for all of the Wikibooks, but first I have to identify what content has already been written.  I thought that was going to be an easy task, but it has proven to be a much harder task to accomplish than I originaly thought.  How we are going to catalog Wikibooks is currently up for debate, and a few different systems are being proposed, most of which are based on our current bookshelf system.  This was a very flat cataloging system, and has broken down due to the growth and size of Wikibooks, including the &quot;addition&quot; of the &quot;department&quot; level to our bookshelf system.  However this is still largely in flux.  If this bookshelf system is a mess, the categories on Wikibooks are much worse off and in a dire need of practically a complete overhaul.  

:Little thought has gone into the full depth on how we are going to use categories, although categories have been used for both ''within'' individual books, such as the [[Cookbook]] and how it uses categories, as well as trying to catalog the &quot;front page&quot; of each Wikibook to some sort of consistant category scheme.  These have been thrown into sometimes whimsical categories, and not really grouped together in a logical and consistant manner, just as you have pointed out.  Some of these categories have been established like the [[:Category:GCE Advanced Level|Category:A-level]] by a group that has a specific goal in mind for some of the content here on Wikibooks, and trying to tailor the needs of their particular school system for the content in one of their Wikibooks.

:I know this isn't the answer that you were looking for, but the point is that we need some volunteers to help out with this task here on Wikibooks, and any assistance to trying to find a solution and answer is greatly appreciated.  There are some interested Wikibooks participants who want to deal with this issue, so I think there will be some more clear guidelines in the future.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:41, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

: For (1) I don't think wikiversity is taking students yet, but I could well be wrong. You might have better luck asking at [[Talk:Wikiversity]]
: For (2) (a) a user talk page is the &quot;discussion&quot; page for a particular user. If you have an account on wikibooks, you can get to your own user talk page by clicking the &quot;my talk&quot; link in the upper right hand corner. If you want to look at other users' talk pages, you can usually click their name in a signature, then select &quot;discussion&quot; from the menu at the top of the page. (Also, you can correctly sign your name using four tildes, like this &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;)
: For (2) (b) a watchlist is a way for you to monitor changes to specific pages. If you have an account on wikibooks, you can add items to your watchlist by clicking &quot;watch&quot; from the menu at the top of the page. You can get to your watchlist by clicking &quot;my watchlist&quot; from the upper right of the page.

:Responding to this from somebody who has been on Wikibooks for some time:
:#Wikiversity is not really that new of a project.  It has been going in one form or another for about two years now, although all of that as a sub-project on Wikibooks.  See [[Wikiversity]] and if you really care to, look at the history tab to see how long ago the first edits really were.
:#As far as becoming a student, there have been a couple of courses that were started on Wikiversity with a teacher/student model being used and instruction being offered, usually through either e-mail or IRC channels.  These unfortunately have been done on a completely ad-hoc basis and are more the exception rather than the rule at present with Wikiversity.  Right now most of the effort for Wikiversity is going into the organization aspects of it, and trying to present a formal proposal to the Wikimedia Foundation board to become a full Wikimedia sister project.  In one of the largest user interst surveys done to date, it was accepted by the body of Wikimedia users but has hit some serious red tape in terms of obtaining the final approval.  I think there is some value to this in the sense that the mission of Wikiversity is being clarified and (hopefully) Wikiversity won't go through the headaches that Wikibooks is currently facing in terms of its mission.  
:I believe that Wikiversity, once fully established and promoted, will become a huge run-away success.  Stay in touch and watch Wikiversity recieve its formal launch some time this summer.  There will be Wikiversity classes being taught this fall.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:29, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

:While we're at it. Wikiversity is linked to Wikibooks and has nothing to do with Wikipedia apart from the fact they're both run by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia is it's best known project, but that doesn't mean it precedes over all other wiki projects in either the Wikimedia Foundation or elsewhere.

== audio books ==

Hi, 

after a brief search I can find no mention of audio books.

Is there a section which is available for audio books?

Is there any ongoing (or should there be) an ongoing project to create audio books from the written for those with reduced site, those who want to learn something while commuting, or those who wish to hear a book for, say, language learning reasons?

===update===

well after some more searching - I found an article where [[Wikinews:Interview with LibriVox founder Hugh_McGuire|wikinews interviews Hugh McGuire]] about [http://www.librivox.org/ librivox] - so it looks like someone is already doing something like this - it would be good if they cooperate with wikibooks as well. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:anonymous user|anonymous user]] ([[User talk:anonymous user|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/anonymous user|contribs]]).&lt;/small&gt;

:One thing to keep in mind here is that if you see a need, like making printed versions of Wikibooks (PDFs) or audio books, help us by creating the content.  Things like this don't get created spontaneously, but need somebody to actually hunker down and make it.  Wikinews in particular has been in the forefront of creating audio content, where there was even some talk about creating a 24-hour Wikinews broadcast channel of Wikinews stories.  That may happen in the future still.  As for audio Wikibook, you might want to help us out by creating something like [[Wikibooks:PDF Versions]] that instead is for audio books.  I would recommend that you use .ogg (Ogg Vorbis) files simply because you don't have the patent issues of MP3s.

== Wikibooks: Wikijunior: Wikiprimary? ==

As an elementary school teacher, I am always looking for resources that are well-written, engaging, content-rich, non-fiction that is written for K-2 readers.

How would I go about starting a project like this?  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:MarvyMommy|MarvyMommy]] ([[User talk:MarvyMommy|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/MarvyMommy|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}.&lt;/small&gt;

:I would recommend that you simply try to start a brand new Wikibook that would demonstrate the idea you would like to start up.  Perhaps it can be folded into Wikijunior or be something entirely different like the Wikiprimary that you are suggested.  To do this, please read [[Help:How to start a book]], that goes into some depth about the process of writing a whole new Wikibook.

:One problem that I've seen by my particiation on Wikijunior is that dropping the grade level down to early reading levels is quite difficult for many adults, and K-2 grade levels I would imagine is especially difficult.  It can be done, but this is a gift for prose that does require some extra work, and writing even a couple of sentances for this age group can be from my perspective just as difficult as writing a whole page of content for adults.

== Firefox extension building - need to have website respond with data ==

I'm starting to get down the basics of XUL and XML, but I'm still hazy on how to retrieve data from for example http://www.imdb.com/ReleasedInYear?year=2006&amp;country=Netherlands

Does such a site have to be in a RSS or XML format (in which case this doesn't work unless you can convert it before use) or is it possible? And how would I select just the films with a certain release date from the list? I already perused the XML Wikibook, but so far I found the info here and elsewhere on the web with regard to info retrieval unclear.

: If I was programming this in perl, I would use the HTML::Parser from LWP (libwww-perl). If I have time, then I should add LWP to the [[Perl Programming|Programming:Perl]] book... but I see that you are programming in Firefox, not Perl.

: The URL that you gave is not in RSS or XML but in HTML 3.2. ''You can still use the Document Object Model to extract info from it.'' First you need to grab the document object. In JavaScript, you can use &lt;code&gt;var movieWin = window.open( ... )&lt;/code&gt; to obtain a window, then &lt;code&gt;var movieDoc = movieWin.document&lt;/code&gt; to obtain the document. However, this has the side effect of opening a pop-up window.

: The answer seems to be to use XMLHttpRequest. Though that sounds like you can only get XML, the page at http://kb.mozillazine.org/XMLHttpRequest says otherwise. I have not tried this, but try creating an XMLHttpRequest object and GET the url, then using the &lt;code&gt;responseXML&lt;/code&gt; property as the document, even though it is really an HTML document. I do not know if this works. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:02, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Who were the Goths?==
The Goths were a Germanic tribe that later formed two branches, the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths. The Goths are believed to have immigrated to Poland in the first century A.D. from Gotland.  They later moved by the Black Sea in what is now the Ukraine. The Gothic People greatly influenced later Roman culture.

==When did they live?==
The Goths lived from the 2nd century to the 6th century. During the 5th and 6th centuries, the Goths were divided into the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths.

==What country did they live in?==
They lived in southern Scandinavia.

==What did their buildings look like?==
Gothic Architecture started in Northern France. It had great success in 1200 A.D. Gothic's were well known for their churches. The churches were tall and thin with pointed arches. The walls were massive to carry weight. Inside the church there were tall stain glassed windows. Figures of saints, animals, and flowers were painted on the stained glass windows. Fresco’s (done in plaster that are put onto walls and ceiling) were painted on them. 

* &lt;u&gt;Age of Faith&lt;/u&gt; Anne Fremantle NewYork: TimeLife Books. 1965
* &lt;u&gt;The Middle Ages An Illustrated History&lt;/u&gt; Barbra A. Hanawalt  NewYork: Oxford University Press. 1998

==What did they eat?==
They ate mostly sheep, cattle, pigs and chickens. They also ate some plant based foods such as wheat, barley.
.

==What did they wear?==
Goths wore a Sagum, an open robe or cloak that looks like those worn by ancient Roman soldiers. These cloaks were fastened using a thorn or a spina, a spike made out of bone. They also wore furs blankets, coats and warm clothes made from animals they hunted or raised and then skinned.

==What did their writing look like?==
By the 4th century CE, the Goths were becoming Christianized. At this time, the Goths wrote their language using their version of the Futhark alphabet, but it was deemed to be a pagan invention. Instead, Bishop Wulfila (or Ulfilas), a Greek missionary responsible for the conversion of the Goths to Christianity, took the Greek alphabet, added letters from Latin and Futhark alphabets, and created a new alphabet to write the Gothic language. 

Note that there are two letters that don't stand for any sounds. This is because they were adopted from Greek only for their numeric value. The Classical Greek alphabet doubled as a number system, and each letter had a number associated with it. The Gothic alphabet continued this tradition, and so in the case of Gothic, the first row of letters have numeric values of 1 to 9, the second row from 10 to 90, and the third row from 100 to 900. 

The Goths spoke a Germanic language, and it is unique not only in that it is the earliest documented Germanic language, but also in that it is the only language in a completely separate branch of the Germanic family unrelated to any other surviving Germanic languages. 

In most of Europe, the Gothic alphabet and language slowly faded into obscurity by the 9th century CE. The Gothic language survived in the Crimea but it too became extinct around the 17th century CE.

==What did they believe?==

The ancient Goths followed we originally pagan, but converted to Christianity by the 4th century CE.

==Are some of them famous even today?==

They are famous in the present because of the brilliant things and culture they gave us. Studying ancient civilizations like the Goths can help us to understand other culture and can help us in the future.

==What is left of them today?==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objectives and Risks ==

Swarming attacks are highly dangerous attempts to smother the opponent and/or control an enemy trap with a large number of pieces.  This type of attack is only rarely seen in the opening phase of the game, but many players will use this attack if an opportunity arises to blockade an enemy Elephant or work towards a win by immobilization.  If a swarming attack is attempted during the opening phase, the attacking play will often either fail miserably and lose a considerable number of pieces in rapid succession, or will succeed brilliantly when the defender is crushed under the weight of the attack.

'''''Note: For simplicity, many examples below will assume that the Gold player is attacking the c6 trap.  Naturally, the same theories can apply equally to attacks on all 4 traps.'''''

Reasons to use a Multi-Piece Swarming Attack:
* to smother the enemy so that an entire wing is effectively immobilized
* to establish a space advantage, possibly controlling the center
* to blockade the enemy Elephant, possibly with the intention of freeing the attacking Elephant from the c6 trap
* to create long-term goal threats from burrowed and advanced Rabbits

Summary of risks (assuming Gold attacks the c6 trap):
* If a swarming attack fails, and attacking Elephant is lured away by a counter-attack, the weaker pieces in the swarm will suffer high casualty rates, especially the Rabbits.
* If a Camel is used to secure b6, it may be taken hostage.
* The swarming player's goal defense and/or home trap defense will be weakened due to the high number of pieces required in a swarm attack.
* The attacking Elephant may become blockaded on d6, possibly with friendly Rabbits locked into the d5 and e5 squares.

== Ideal Placement of Pieces ==

A swarming attack often begins with the Gold Elephant on d6.  The Elephant may have to get comfortable on that square, because it will often be pinned there for many moves.

It is absolutely essential for Gold to control the b6 square if a swarming attack has any chance of success.  A strong piece can be lodged onto b6, or less commonly, a weak piece can be secured on the square by blockading the entire position, preventing the defender from accessing b6.  An exception occurs if the enemy Elephant is located on b6, for example in a hostage situation.  Because the attacker cannot take the b6 square, it is often best to attempt a blockade, including an attacker on c6.  If the attacker succeeds in controlling b6 or blockading the enemy Elephant, it is sometimes possible to rotate the Gold Elephant off d6 in order to pursue the Silver Horses or Camel.

If the attacker can create goal threats, it is beneficial to have a very strong piece on c7.  The Elephant should not be stationed on c7 unless there is a very compelling reason, such as a powerful goal threat.

== Defensive Systems and Counter-Attacks ==

In order to understand the best defensive techniques, it is essential to understand the objectives of the attacking player.  If the Gold Elephant is pinned on d6 with a Rabbit framed on c6, and a defending Horse is positioned on b6, then Silver can build a sturdy defense by placing the Silver Elephant on c5.  

There are only three obvious strategies for the attacker in that situation: 
# Use the Camel to control b6 or drag the horse to the home trap with the idea of luring the Silver Elephant away from c5.
# Move the Camel to b6 in the hopes of it being taken hostage, then attacking the enemy Elephant with a swarm of potential blockaders.
# Repeatedly drag defending Rabbits and other small piece towards the c3 trap to gain material and soften Silver's goal and trap defenses.  

These positions can be difficult and it is benefiical to study example games in order to learn the strategies.

While it is tempting to counter-attack against the f3 trap - which may be weakened - and/or advance Rabbits against a Swiss-cheese goal defense, actual practice suggests that the defender's best chances may lie in the proper defense of c6 rather than an immediate counter-attack.  If Gold can be stopped cold so that the attackers are completely prevented from having any hopes of controlling the c6 trap, the Gold position will often become hopeless and Silver can slowly and safely proceed to build a powerful advantage.  Ideally, after the c6 attack is thwarted and the counter-attack begins, Gold will have no choice but to withdraw the Elephant from d6 and suffer massive losses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ZZT-OOP has a very simple syntax, as demonstrated by the following example:

&lt;pre&gt;
@Fred
'Objects run their programs right away;
'the following command will temporarily
'halt program execution.
#end
:touch
$This is an object named Fred!
!move;Tell Fred to move around.
#end
:move
/rndp rndne/rndp rndne
?n?n?n?n?s?s?s?s
FRED: I moved around!
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first character of each statement determines how the rest of the line is treated. For example, the first line begins with the &quot;at&quot; symbol (@), which makes it a name; the second line begins with an apostrophe, which makes it a comment, ''etc''... Our discussion of ZZT-OOP syntax continues with a list of all the possible starting characters and their effects.

== ' (Comment) ==
This is a comment, it does nothing but inform you or whoever looks at your code what a function does. '''If you have a very large file (&gt;320KB), get rid of any of these you may have''' (not including ones used as ''zapped'' labels). Also: this statement isn't a comment in fact, but a pre-''zapped'' label (that means you can jump to it only after you ''restored'' it)

== (Text), $(Text) ==
This prints a line of text at the bottom of the screen, or if there is more than one line, print a scroll. Using &lt;code&gt;$(Text)&lt;/code&gt; prints text in a scroll centred and in white.

== :(Label) ==
This is a label. You can jump to labels. Yes. You can also make other programs jump to labels.

== !(Label);(Text) ==
This prints a line of text in a scroll in white with a pink arrow as a bulletpoint. This is an ''option''. Selecting it will call the label given.

== @ (Object Name) ==
The &quot;@&quot; character indicates that the rest of the line is the object's name. In the example above, the line &lt;code&gt;@Fred&lt;/code&gt; gives the object the name &quot;Fred.&quot; The only limit on object names is that they must be stated on the first line of the program; &quot;@&quot; statements elsewhere in the file are ignored.

If a named object opens a text box, the object's name appears at the top of the textbox, replacing the generic title &quot;Interaction.&quot; It is not necessary to give an object a name.

== # (Generic Command) ==
The &quot;#&quot; character indicates a command, or a jump to a label. For example, the example program uses the command &lt;code&gt;#end&lt;/code&gt; to stop program execution. Many other commands exist; they will be discussed in detail in the next couple of chapters. For now, it is good enough to know what they look like.

== / and ? (Movement) ==
The &quot;/&quot; character instructs the object to move. The direction that the object moves is indicated by the text that follows; for example, &lt;code&gt;/n&lt;/code&gt; causes the object to move one space to the north (move up one space). When &quot;/&quot; is used and the object cannot move in the specified direction, the object will simply wait until it can move in that direction; this results in the object waiting forever if it is facing something that does not move, such as a wall. The &quot;?&quot; character works like &quot;/&quot;, but with one difference: &quot;?&quot; movement commands will be ignored if the object cannot move in the specified direction.

Both &quot;?&quot; and &quot;/&quot; are unique because they can be &quot;stacked&quot;; this means that a movement instruction can be followed by another statement. For instance, in the example program, you saw the code &lt;code&gt;?n?n?n?n?s?s?s?s&lt;/code&gt;. When this code runs, the movement instructions will be followed from left to right; the object will try to move four spaces upward, then four spaces downward. Types of statement can be mixed; for example, it is perfectly alright to say &lt;code&gt;/n?n?n/n&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;/n/n/s/s#end&lt;/code&gt;. However, you cannot stack a statement onto a non-movement statement. That is to say, &lt;code&gt;/n/s/e/w#end&lt;/code&gt; is valid ZZT-OOP, but &lt;code&gt;/n/s/e/w#end/n&lt;/code&gt; is ''not''.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Template:US Income Tax}}
Gains and losses from the sale or exchange of '''capital assets''' receive separate treatment from &quot;ordinary&quot; gains and losses. '''Capital gains''' are taxed before income, at a significantly lower rate than ordinary gains. '''Capital losses''', on the other hand, are only useful to offset capital gains and a small amount of personal income. As a result, tax planners often attempt to maximize capital gains while minimizing capital losses (i.e. reworking them into ordinary losses).

==Capital assets==

In the context of capital gains and losses, the word &quot;capital&quot; has a different meaning than it has in other areas of law. Capital assets are not necessarily those that are &quot;[[US Income Tax: Business Deductions#Capitalization|capitalized]]&quot; by businesses, for instance. The Code does not define &quot;capital assets,&quot; but instead states that capital assets are ''not'' the following:

* Business inventory (assets bought and sold in the regular course of business).
* Business supplies.
* Accounts .
* Depreciable trade or business assets held for one year or less (including business real estate).
* Copyrights and creative works created by or gifted to the taxpayer.
* Government publications.
* Hedging transactions.
* Commodities derivatives held by brokers.

Any other asset is considered a capital asset.

==Calculating capital gains and losses==

===Net capital gain===

Most capital gains and losses are taxed as '''net capital gain'''. Net capital gain is taxed at 15% for taxpayers in the 25% tax bracket or above, and 5% for other taxpayers (unless they are below the minimum tax bracket, in which case they are not taxed).

The Code defines net capital gain as the excess of '''net long-term capital gain''' over '''net short-term capital loss'''. These two figures are reached by adding up the various long-term and short-term capital gains and losses realized in the taxable year. Gains and losses from assets held for over one year are considered long-term capital gains and losses, while gains and losses from assets held for one year or less are considered short-term capital gains and losses.

The calculation might look like this:

{|
!
! Long-term
! Short-term
|-
| '''Gains'''
| 2,000
| 2,000
|-
| '''Losses'''
| 10,000
| 4,000
|-
| '''Net gains'''
| 0
| 0
|-
| '''Net losses'''
| 8,000
| 2,000
|}

Because there is no excess, there is no net capital gain. The '''net capital loss''' is $10,000.

{|
!
! Long-term
! Short-term
|-
| '''Gains'''
| 15,000
| 2,500
|-
| '''Losses'''
| 4,000
| 6,000
|-
| '''Net gains'''
| 11,000
| 0
|-
| '''Net losses'''
| 0
| 3,500
|}

Because there is an excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss, the excess $7,500 is taxable at the 5% or 15% rate. Which rate is used depends on which bracket the taxpayer is in.

===Net capital losses===

Net capital losses are used for '''offsetting'''.

Individuals can use up to $3,000 of capital losses to offset their income ($1,500 for a married person filing separately). In the above example, the taxpayer would be able to apply $3,000 of his or her net capital loss to reduce his or her taxable income by $3,000, leaving $7,000 in unused net capital loss.

Capital losses can also be '''carried over'''. If net long-term capital loss exceeds net short-term capital gain, the excess becomes long-term capital loss in the following year. If net short-term capital loss exceeds net long-term capital gain, the excess becomes short-term capital loss in the following year.

Corporations follow different rules. Their capital losses must first be '''carried back''' to each of the three preceding years, if possible. Any capital losses that cannot be applied against capital gains from the three previous years can then be applied against capital gains in the 5 succeeding tax years.

For example, assume that X Corporation has $50,000 in net capital losses in 2005. Their capital gains for the last three years are:

{|
|'''2002''': || 0
|-
|'''2003''': || 23,000
|-
|'''2004''': || 11,000
|}

The net capital losses cannot be carried back to 2002 because there is no net capital gain to offset. $23,000 can be used to offset the capital gains in 2003, leaving $27,000. Another $11,000 can be used to offset the capital gains in 2004, leaving $16,000. This $16,000 can be used to offset any net capital gains that arise in the next five years.

===Section 1231 assets===

Many assets held for use in a trade or business receive separate treatment under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-P-IV-1231.html Section 1231]. These assets include those that are:

* sold or exchanged, and
** held for more than one year and
** used for a trade or business and
** depreciable and
** not inventory or intellectual property, OR
* converted (i.e. destroyed/stolen/condemned), and
** used for a trade or business OR
*** held for more than one year and
*** held in connection with a trade or business or venture for profit.

Any gains and losses allowed under Section 1231 are added up. If gains exceed losses, the net gain is treated as long-term capital gain for that year. But if losses exceed gains, the net loss is treated as ordinary loss. This seems to give taxpayers the &quot;best of both worlds&quot; in a sense: they can receive the favorable capital gains rate for 1231 gains, and can treat 1231 losses as ordinary losses directly against their income.

There is one qualification that destroys much of this attractiveness: '''recapture'''. Under Section 1231(c), 1231 gains are treated as ordinary income to the extent of net 1231 losses over the past five years. This means that 1231 losses may only provide a temporary advantage: if there are 1231 gains within the next five years, they will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that they offset the prior loss.

===Section 1245 recapture===

The capital gain system is also tempered by [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-P-IV-1245.html Section 1245], which provides for recapture of prior depreciation deductions on personal property. When 1245 property is sold, depreciation is added to the adjusted basis to find the '''recomputed basis''' of the property. If the recomputed basis and the amount realized both exceed adjusted basis, the excess is treated as ordinary income, not capital gain. Any amount realized over the recomputed basis can be 1231 gain or capital gain.

For instance, assume a machine is purchased for $100, depreciated by $40 and sold. Its adjusted basis is $60: adding depreciation back in, its recomputed basis is $100, which exceeds adjusted basis. If the machine sells for $65, the amount realized also exceeds adjusted basis, and the $5 gain is treated as ordinary income. If the machine sells for $110, the first $40 gain is treated as ordinary income, and the remaining $10 may be capital gain or 1231 gain.

Section 1245 applies generally to depreciable personal property, but not to real property.

==cvsgui.Macro module==
This module defines the Macro class, which is used to extend the capabilities of cvsgui. The user can add new macros by subclassing the Macro class. Here is a trivial example: 

 import cvsgui.Macro&lt;br&gt;
 class ThisIsATrivialUserMacro( Macro ):
      def __init__( self ):
          cvsgui.Macro.Macro.__init__( self, 'MyItem', MACRO_SELECTION, 0, 'MySubMenu' )&lt;br&gt;
      def Run( self ):
          print 'MyMacro has been called'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 # Register the new macro by executing the class
 ThisIsATrivialUserMacro()
Registering this macro adds a submenu 'MySubMenu' to the 'Macros' menu (if the submenu doesn't exist already), and in it creates one new item 'MyItem', with trivial action. See below for more details.

===Variables===
Constants used by the Macro class:&lt;br&gt;
MACRO_SELECTION = &quot;SELECTION&quot; &lt;br&gt;
MACRO_ADMIN 	= &quot;ADMIN&quot;

===Functions===
none

=== Class: Macro===
This class needs to be subclassed to implement a user macro. Executing the new subclass adds the macro to the cvsgui macro registry (this is done by a call to &lt;tt&gt;Macro.__init__()&lt;/tt&gt;). You can overwrite the methods of the Macro() class and add your own methods. See method descriptions below for details.

====Methods:====
Since Macro() is usually subclassed, the ''self'' argument has been retained in the following descriptions.&lt;br&gt;To implement your own macro override each of the following methods

; __init__(''self'') : This method should always be overridden. It should always start with a call to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;Macro.__init__(self, title, group, isCheck=0, subgroup=&quot;&quot;, xpmicon=&quot;&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;to register the macro in the registry with the appropriate arguments:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Title is the text that will appear on the menu entry; appending a tab(\t) and a combination of either CTRL or ALT, or both, and a letter will register that as the menu accelerator(e.g. &quot;MenuTitle\tCTRL+ALT+M&quot;). Group needs to be MACRO_SELECTION or MACRO_ADMIN; if it is not macro registration will fail. MACRO_SELECTION macros appear in the 'Macros' menu, MACRO_ADMIN macros appear in the 'Admin&gt;&gt;Macro' menu item.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IsCheck specifies whether the menu item can have a checkmark in front. Default = 0 (no check mark) &lt;''check this''&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the macro menu item should appear in a subfolder, specify the subfolder name in subgroup; default is &quot;&quot; (no subfolder).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xpmicon specifies an optional icon that appears in front of the item; default is &quot;&quot; (no icon). Xpmicon uses a special string format &lt;''Add format description here''&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;After this call add initilisation your macro may require.

; OnCmdUI( ''self'', cmdui ) : This method is called from the Python interface (_cvsgui) for the macro to define its state (enabled/disabled). This call occurs whenthe users clicks on the 'Macros' or the 'Admin&gt;&gt;Macro' menu. The 'cmdui' argument passed by the interface is the CmdUI object corresponding to the selected macro.&lt;br&gt;For a MACRO_SELECTION macro, default behavior is that the menu item is only enabled when there is a (non-zero) selection active. Default for MACRO_ADMIN macros is to be enabled them on this call.&lt;br&gt;Override this method to change the default behavior. 

; Run(''self'') : This Method is called from the interface when the macro is selected. Default is to do nothing.&lt;br&gt;Override to add an action to the macro.

=== Class: TclMacro===
Subclass of Macro: This class wraps Tcl macros
; TclMacro( title, group, file ) : Create a Tcl Macro from file.

====Methods:====
; Run() : Called from the interface when the macro is selected

===Class: MenuSeparator( subclass of Macro) ===
This class is a convenient way to insert a menu separator
; MenuSeparator( group, subgroup=&quot;&quot; ) :

==cvsgui.App module==
Provides interaction with the cvsgui application.

===Functions===
; cvs_out( s ) [deprecated] : Print text in the application console. This is for backward compatibility only, you can use sys.stdout directly

; cvs_err( s ) [deprecated] : Print text in the application console. This is for backward compatibility only, you can use sys.stderr directly

; GetSelection() : Return a list of the CvsEntry, or CvsEntries, that is/are currently selected in the file or folder browser. Each element in the list is a CvsEntry class.

; PromptMessage( msg, title=&quot;Message&quot;, default=&quot;OK&quot;, cncl=&quot;Cancel&quot; ) : Pops up a message box with a message. Returns 1 (OK button pressed, default) or 0 (cancel).

; PromptEditMessage( msg, value, title=&quot;Message&quot;, default=&quot;OK&quot;, cncl=&quot;Cancel&quot; ) : Pops up a message box with message string 'msg', and an edit box in which the user can verify or edit 'value'. Returns a list with two entries 1 + (updated) value when the user presses OK (default) or 0 (cancel). ''Note: the value of the title parameter is not passed and always shows up as &quot;Title&quot;. This is a bug in the Cvsgui source code (not in the python interface).''

; LaunchBrowser( url ) : Launch a web browser with the URL

==cvsgui.CmdUI module==
CmdUI class, set the state of an object in the interface

===Variables===
TRUE&lt;br&gt;
FALSE

===Class: CmdUI===
This class is a wrapper around Windows CmdUI objects defined in the WinCVS interface. It defines the UI element associated with a command and lets you manipulate its state. The instances of this class are always created by the interface _cvsgui (and the corresponding Windows object is placed in an internal variable) &lt;''need check this - but I haven't found any place where CmdUI() is called''&gt;. When passed back to Python, they usually show up as argument to a OnCmdUI() call, where the user can set attributes: en-/dis-abled, set text, checkmarks etc.

====Methods:====
; Enable( state ) : Enable (state=1)/Disable (state=0) the object (i.e. menu entry, icon...).

; SetCheck( state ) : Check(state=1)/uncheck(state=0) the object (i.e. menu entry, icon...)

; SetText( text ) : Rename the object (i.e. menu entry, icon...)

==cvsgui.ColorConsole module==
ColorConsole class, provides *some* coloring in the console window

===Variables===
kNormal, kBrown, kGreen, kMagenta, kRed, kBlue,	kBold,&lt;br&gt;kItalic, kUnderline, kNL

===Class: ColorConsole===
; ColorConsole() : ColorConsole class, provides *some* coloring in the console window

====Methods:====
; out( stringOrStyle ) : Print text in the application console

; Operator &lt;&lt; : Print text in the application console, e.g.:&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;ColorConsole() &lt;&lt; kRed &lt;&lt; &quot;This is red&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.

==cvsgui.Cvs module==
Defines Cvs class, which launches cvs

===Variables===
None

===Functions===
None

===Class: Cvs===
; Cvs( quiet = 0, exitOnError = 1 ) : Initialize and optionally set the exitOnError flag; if true, cvs will throw an exception on an error (default is true). The quiet flag tells if stderr and stdout of the cvs process are reported into the client console (default is false)

====Methods:====
; Run( *args ) : Launch a cvs process with some arguments, return the error code, stdout and stderr of the process. Throws if an error occur if exitOnError is true

==cvsgui.CvsEntry module==
CvsEntry class, information for an entry of CVS/Entries

===Variables===
none

===Functions===
none

===Class: CvsEntry===
; CvsEntry( entry ) : Create instance of CvsEntry class for entry

====Methods:====
; GetName() : Return the name of the entry (file/folder) without its path

; GetFullName() : Return the full qualified name of the entry (file or folder)

; GetPath() : Return the full qualified name of the parent folder, i.e. the folder the entry is in

; GetVersion() : Return the revision number of the file

; GetUTC() :  Return the modification time (in UTC) of the repository file which was used to update the file for the last time

; GetKeyword() : Return the substitution keyword for the file

; GetTag() : Return the name of the tag (or the branch) where the file is checked out

=Support Modules=
The following modules are written by [http://people.freenet.de/ogiesen/ Oliver Giesen]

==cvsgui.MacroUtils module==

===Variables===
None

===Functions===
; prepareTargets(entries, args, doChDir = 1) : Given a CvsEntries list, calculates a common basedir and a corresponding list of targets. This is necessary in order to ensure correct behaviour when working on flat view selections. See macros cvs2cl.py or TagAndUpdate.py for examples of usage.

; purgeTree(path) : shutil.rmtree() cannot delete read-only files, so we need to do it manually by changing the attributes on each file to r/w before deleting.

===Classes===
None

==cvsgui.SafeTk module==
When using Tkinter, the module FixTk is imported which creates an environment variable TCL_LIBRARY and points it at the TCL libraries within the Python installation. This has the unfortunate effect that TCL macros running from a separate installation of TCL will now try to locate packages within the Python directories instead of the TCL ones, which usually fails because the directories within the Python installation are named differently. This module employs a fix to this by removing said environment variable and only temporarily enabling it for the lifetime of a Tkinter-based Tk instance.

===Variables===
TCL_LIB = 'TCL_LIBRARY'
tcllib : set with value of 'TCL_LIBRARY' environment variable when module is loaded.

===Functions===
; prepTk() : Ensure that TCL_LIBRARY points to the path determined in the FixTk module

; resetTk() :  Delete the TCL_LIBRARY environment variable, so TCL has to go searching for extension packages on its own instead of depending on the Python search path. Make a backup of the value determined in the FixTk module so we could write it back again later.

===Class: SafeTkRoot===
; SafeTkRoot( Tk ) : A replacement for the Tk class which ensures the TCL_LIBRARY variable lives only as long as the Tk-instance does.

; SafeTkRoot( obj ) : set basename to obj

====Methods:====
; destroy() :  &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

; checkTk() :  Checks whether Tk could be invoked without exceptions. The check is only performed once. Later calls simply return the previous result.

==cvsgui.SubstModeTk module==

===Known Issues===
* It is currently possible to select invalid combinations of flags, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;-kbo&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

===Variables===
none

===Functions===
none

===Class: CvsSubstModeMenu===
; CvsSubstModeMenu( Menu ) : ADD HELP. Will only be created if Tk is available (check with checkTk().

====Methods:====
; update(text) : &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

; createWidgets( oldenc ) : &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

; clear() : &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

===Class: CvsSubstModeUI===
; class CvsSubstModeUI( Frame ) : &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

; CvsSubstModeUI( master, var ) : Will only be created if Tk is available. &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

====Methods:====
; get_mnu() : &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

; popup(event=None) : &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

; createWidgets() : &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

; updateMnu(event) : &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

; setFlags() : &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

; CvsSubstModeUI.updateLabel(flags) : &lt;''Add text here''&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generic For:  Methylphenidate

==Dose==
*Light: 5-15 mg
*Common: 20-40 mg
*Strong: 50+ mg

Ritalin comes in 5, 10, 15, and 20 Mg doses.  May come in an instant release but is more commonly found in XR (Extended Release) form.  For enhanced effects but a shorter duration, you may crush the time release capsules and parachute (crush in napkin and swallow as if a pill).  It may also be insufflated (snorted) for even more intense effects.  There have been reports of the drug being injected, but these are rare.  Keep in mind that tolerance and addiction may easily develop on this drug from irresponsible abuse.  

''*IMPORTANT*''- Tolerance builds up quickly with repeated use.  A dose that is right for an experienced user may not be right for you.  Remember that you can always take more, but once you've taken more you can't take less.

==Duration==

===From an XR capsule===
*Come up: 1/2-1 hour
*Peak: 1 &amp; 4 hours
*Come down/ After effects: Up to 24 hours

===From an instant release pill===
*Come up: 20-40 Minutes
*Peak: 1-3 hours
*Come down/ After effects: Up to 24 hours

This seems to vary in name from enchufa, enchufe and enchufla to even enshufta.

The leader turns the follower to her left, and at the same time moves around so
that when she has finished her turn she is facing him.  It's about 140 degrees
around, depending on the dancers and the size of the rueda.  The leader normally
then moves to the right of the follower, and moves on to the next follower, doing
a [[Rueda de Casino/Dile Que No|Dile Que No]].  If the enchufa is in the middle of another move, this moving on
doesn't happen, i.e., enchufa is often used to mean a follower's left turn.
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Who pays tax, and how much they pay, is dependent on the type of entity paying the tax.

==Single taxpayers==

==Families==

===Married taxpayers===

If a taxpayer is married, they can either file a '''joint return''' with their spouse, or '''file separately'''.

One commonly-debated point of income tax law is the '''marriage penalty'''. Married taxpayers are taxed at different rates than single taxpayers whether they file jointly or separately. The &quot;marriage penalty&quot; is most pronounced when spouses have equal incomes, and becomes less detrimental as the spouses' incomes diverge. When one spouse has much more income than the other, the couple's tax liability is actually ''lower'' than it would be if they were both single. For instance, under the Code's rates unadjusted for inflation, a married couple with taxable income of $100,000 would pay $23,529 in taxes. If the couple were unmarried and both had taxable income of $50,000, they would pay $11,127 each, or a total of $22,254. But a single person with taxable income of $100,000 would pay $26,522. As a result, marriage is beneficial, tax-wise, when one spouse works and the other does not; it is often detrimental when both spouses work.

There has been, as of yet, no truly equitable solution posed to the marriage dilemma: every conceivable system would offer marriage bonuses in some cases and marriage penalties in others.

===Head of household===

Under Section 1(b), an unmarried taxpayer with one or more dependents in their household may file taxes as a '''head of household'''. Heads of household pay less tax than equivalent single taxpayers, but they pay more tax than an equivalent married couple filing jointly.

===Dependents===

Anyone with income is liable for taxes on that income, even if they are listed as a dependent on someone else's tax return.

Minor children are always taxed independently on their income under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-II-73.html Section 73], regardless of whether they are emancipated and regardless of whether they actually receive the income.

If children under 14 have unearned income (e.g. income from returns on investments), their income is taxed at the marginal rates of their parents under Section 1(g). The assumption behind this rule is that parents may be tempted to place assets in their children's names to avoid tax liability.

==Alternative minimum tax==

==Corporations==

Corporate taxes are levied by the schedule in [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-A-II-11.html Section 11]. Most large corporations and all public corporations are classified as '''C corporations''' and are subject to corporate taxes. Smaller private companies can qualify as '''S corporations''', which exempts them from corporate tax liability. However, all corporate distributions to shareholders are taxed regardless of whether the corporation has C or S status. In the case of C corporations, this means that profits passed on to shareholders are taxed twice: once as corporate income, and once as personal income. This '''double taxation''' problem is a major issue to investors when deciding how to structure a business.

==Partnerships and LLCs==

Partnerships are not taxed. Instead, their partners pay tax on their proportion of the profits of the entity, regardless of whether those profits are distributed or reinvested. This is known as '''pass-through''' or '''flow-through taxation'''. Limited liability companies (LLCs) with more than one member usually follow a similar tax structure; single-member LLCs are taxed as an extension of the owner.

The IRS offers '''check-the-box''' taxation for such entities, which allows the managers to decide whether to have their LLC taxed as a corporation or partnership by checking boxes on a form. By default, such entities are taxed as partnerships; in some situations, however, it is beneficial to have an entity taxed as a corporation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The more you work with spreadsheets, the more you will see how inventive people can be in making mistakes, or in misunderstanding what was intended.  You have to assume that if it can be read the wrong way, someone will read it wrong.

The guidelines below are all aimed at making it harder to make mistakes. 

== Inputs and Data ==

* Separate inputs &amp; assumptions from calculations (this is crucial)
* Label &amp; colour input cells clearly
* Protect &amp; constrain inputs with data validation or user controls
* If you are importing data, keep it separate from the calculations
* Give important variables range names, and use them in formulae
* Treat constants (e.g. tax rates) as (unchangeable) inputs – never hard code them into formulae as numbers
* Clearly explain anything that may be unfamiliar or confusing

== Formulae &amp; Calculations ==

* Protect calculations – on a separate sheet, or protect the sheet
* Flow calculations from left to right, top to bottom, to echo Excel's calculation sequence, and also the way people will &quot;read&quot; the spreadsheet
*Highlight any cells with inconsistent formulae (i.e. different to neighbours) – preferably don’t do this at all because these anomalies can be very hard to find and may be overwritten if someone else makes a change and copies it down a whole column!
* Use colours carefully – keep bright colours for warnings
* Use a consistent layout &amp; design between sheets
* Use consistent magnitudes/time intervals (e.g. months or years)
* Show sources (references, links to source documents, extracts)
* Include anomaly checks and self-tests (e.g. cross-totals) so that the model checks itself as much as possible
* Don’t be clever! e.g. don’t use obscure functions that no-one else understands
* Don’t create incredibly long formulae – rather use more columns
* Don’t distract or confuse the checker 

== Results ==

* Set results out clearly and unambiguously
* State all key assumptions, especially in printable results
* Put date (and version number if any) on printouts

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most important thing to remember is that you are the last line of defence. You aren’t just there to look for typos, and anything you miss could cost a lot of money or embarrassment, so be careful and don’t rush.

In the notes that follow, we’ll assume we are checking a model which is important enough to spend a day or two checking, and that we definitely want no errors.  We’ll also consider what can be done to make a model easier to check.

We’ll use the words “check”, “test” &amp; “review” a lot below. They all have the same objective – ensuring the model is correct, or close enough to correct

== Before you start ==


We’ll start with some basic questions before getting into the checking itself.

'''1. Are you the right person to check the model?'''

* Do you understand the business issues behind the model? This is important because you need to ensure that nothing has been left out, e.g. tax considerations. If you don’t know much about the business, then you probably shouldn’t be checking the model.
* Do you understand enough about the technicalities of the model to check it? If it is written in VBA and you can’t read it, then it’s going to be tough.
* Have you built models yourself? Are you experienced in what can go wrong?

'''2. Do you have all the documentation for the model?'''

This should include all relevant correspondence or documents, and anything that will help you understand the business which is being modelled. 

'''3. Do you have enough time and budget to do the job properly?'''


== Getting ready ==

Make a copy of the spreadsheet, rename it, and add a sheet called ‘Review’, which will hold all of your comments. Don’t work off the original spreadsheet.

The Review sheet should have some columns like the following:

[[Image:Reviersheet.GIF]]

In practice, most checkers in business work with the original spreadsheet, making corrections or changes and then giving it back to the builder to check. 

This is OK for most small spreadsheets, but it does confuse the role of builder and checker and you should avoid doing this for important or complex models. If you use a Review sheet, you should not make any changes to the original – the builder should do this after looking at your comments, and then give the model back to you for rechecking. Your job is to check, not to build.

== Checking the functionality ==

The first thing to check, of course, is whether the model does what it is supposed to. You need to find out who wants it and what they asked for, and whether the model is adequate.

In our example of an annuity model, the specification is pretty clear about what is needed, so it should be quite easy to see if it appears to provide everything that was required.

== Checking the logic ==

This is a crucial step, because research shows that logic errors and omissions are hard to pick up. This means you need to be extra careful.

Then you need to check the business logic in the model, before getting into the detail of sheets and cells. Hopefully, the model builder has documented the logic clearly to make it easier to check. This means not only setting out the logic itself, but providing a link to, or an extract of, original documentation, to show where it came from. If this is not the case, you should request that this be done.

The extract below is from an actual spreadsheet which calculates a profitability formula using a previous report, and extract of which is included on the right. This makes it easy for a checker to review the logic.

[[Image:Docx.JPG]]

You can see that this is much better than if the model builder simply began using a mysterious formula like =1-1/(G6+(1-G6)/0.85), without explanation.

As far as possible, you should write out your own logic before looking at the model, because it is easy to be influenced by what you see, and think “That looks OK”, whereas if you’d done it yourself first, you might have spotted something missing.

== Identifying the risk factors ==

Now you understand what the model is supposed to do, and you have worked out the business logic, you should think about what could go wrong, and how serious that could be.

For example, 
* some of the inputs might be dangerous, because users might put in incorrect values by mistake or through ignorance
* there may be combinations of inputs which require different treatment
* some assumptions (e.g. tax rate) may have a significant effect on results
* which inputs or calculations have most effect on the results?
* formulae may not have been copied correctly across rows or columns

At this stage, you should also think about how you can check the model for reasonableness.

== Checking the inputs ==

Your inputs will normally include some or all of

[[Data]]: e.g. employee records, or transaction records. You need to check where the data came from, and that it is correct, and that it has not been altered. Ideally, it should be kept completely separate from the rest of the model (e.g. in a separate worksheet or datafile), to avoid contamination. 

As with everything else, the data needs to be clear. If, for example, there are confusing or mysterious headings, there should be notes to explain them.

[[Assumptions]]: these are the assumptions underlying the model, which are set by the builder and not by users. For example, the model may include a set of the current income tax rates, which obviously don’t need to be input by users because they are the same for everyone.

The assumptions should be set out clearly in one place, clearly labelled and with explanations, and if they are date-sensitive (e.g. tax limits which are changed every year), the effective date should be shown. The cells containing values should be colour-coded to pick them out.

The assumptions need to be documented and justified, because they can have such an effect on the results. If you don’t feel that you could explain the reasons for the assumptions to another actuary, you haven’t done enough work.

If it hasn’t been done already, figure out the limits for assumptions, for example, salary growth may be shown as 4%, but you may decide that it may vary between 0% and 8% in a year. This is important in checking that the model can deal with extreme inputs, and also in checking any sensitivity testing.

[[User inputs]]: this generally only applies where there are going to be users other than the model builder. User inputs can be very dangerous, because users can be very imaginative in what they enter. For example, if asked for an interest rate, they could put in any of 0.7, 7% or 7. The model has to deal with this.

For this reason, user inputs should be “controlled”, by constraining them to valid inputs. Excel’s data validation is the most powerful way to do this, because it will prevent users entering inputs that don’t fall in ranges you specify, or typing in text that isn’t on a list you specify, etc.

An alternative is to use the “controls” that Excel provides, e.g. dropdowns &amp; checkboxes.

As a checker, you should look at the way the inputs have been modelled, and think about what users could do to break the model. How strict you need to be will differ for each model, of course.

You should also check that the user inputs are explained well enough for an average user to understand them.

== Checking the calculations ==

The calculations are where the inputs meet the business logic. This is where it is most important to lay the calculations out clearly and in detail, to make it easier to check them.

The most obvious approach is to follow the layout of the calculations and check the way in which the data, assumptions, inputs and logic have been combined to produce the eventual results. 

Most commonly, the data is in rows, and formulae are in columns.

Formulae should run from left to right, top to bottom, both because this is how we read, and because Excel calculates in this order. Inputs should be at the top left, or on their own sheet.

Things to look for:
* formulae unexpectedly changing in the middle of a table - this will be easiest to spot if you change the font to a monospace font, e.g. Courier, and then, with a click of the Show Formulas button in the toolbar, reveal all the formulae on the sheet
* hard coded numbers (e.g. tax rates) in formulae – these should be taken out and included with the assumptions, even if they are unlikely ever to change
* circularity – should be avoided if at all possible

== Running tests ==

The next step is to run some tests on the inputs. A simple technique is to set all the inputs to 0 or 1 (or whatever) so that the results are very simple indeed and any anomalies jump out immediately. For example, a financial projection with the investment rate and indexation set to nil should just produce a list of unadjusted cashflows, making it easier to see if they are correct.
Another technique is to use “corner” inputs, i.e. put in the highest and lowest values for inputs and see if the model works correctly.
	
You should think about what will happen if you do all your tests and find an error, and then you have to redo all the tests again when the error is fixed. This could get a bit tedious! Depending on the effort involved, you could set up an automated set of tests.

If the model is for internal use, you should try to include your tests in the model itself, so that anyone using it can see exactly what was tested, and perhaps even retest it.

If you can write code, it may be a good idea to set up a set of inputs and use VBA to run through them automatically. This can greatly speed up testing.

Where the business logic is written in VBA (i.e. VBA is doing most of the hard work), it may be difficult to test. You may be able to dump partial results to a sheet for testing. 

== Reasonableness tests ==

You should look for ways to test the reasonableness of the model. For example, there may be figures that were done a year ago which should be similar to the results of the model, or there may be other models which can be used to produce test results for at least part of the current model.

You can also ask the builder to include cross-checks (e.g. totals for columns and rows should match) which help in testing the model.

Sensitivity testing, i.e. changing one of the inputs and seeing what happens, is another way to test for reasonableness, especially if you have some idea of what to expect.

An extension of sensitivity testing is to find out how accurate the model needs to be, then estimate the possible errors in setting the assumptions and inputs (for example, an investment assumption of 7% might be out by 2% either way), and test the impact on the results. This gives a rough idea of how far out the results might be (because the user can’t possibly get all the assumptions absolutely correct), and whether the overall error is acceptable.

== Test in chunks ==

If possible, test the model in chunks, so you can sign it off one part at a time. This makes checking more manageable and it should make finding errors much easier.

== Spreadsheet testing tools ==

There are several spreadsheet testing tools which can help in checking complex spreadsheets. They look for things like inconsistent formulae, &amp; orphan (unused) calculation cells.

== Is it usable? ==

Put yourself in the shoes of the user, or, even better, find someone else to try using it. Is it clear, or is it confusing? 

Can users accidentally change formulae, or put in ridiculous figures?

Remember that users will often not read instructions, and will use the model without thinking. The less expert the user, the more effort needs to go into protecting the model – and especially the inputs – from incorrect use.

One of the most popular prescription sedative-hypnotics, zolpidem, commonly known as Ambien is used as a sleep aid. At prescribed doses, the patient will notice drowsiness within 20-60 minutes within consumption of dose. When intended for recreational use, one person may take even a prescribed dose and simply stay awake. It's not hard to keep yourself awake while under the influence of zolpidem, but one may notice a loss of motor skills if it's their first time. Once the drug begins to have full effect (around an hour after dose) the user most commonly experiences anterograde amnesia, which in the most simplest words means that you will forget what happens while you are under the influence of that drug.

&lt;u&gt;'''Prescription doses of zolpidem include:'''&lt;/u&gt;

'''Ambien'''
*5 mg
*10 mg

'''Ambien CR (Time-Release version)'''
*6.25 mg
*12.5 mg
'''

----

&lt;u&gt;'''How Zolpidem Works'''&lt;/u&gt;

 	
Zolpidem works by binding preferentially to the omega-1 (BZ-1) receptor subtype of the GABAA receptor complex. This subtype is thought to be the one most closely associated with sleep.

In contrast, benzodiazepines do not have a receptor preference, so they bind to—and activate—all omega (BZ) receptor subtypes. Other omega (BZ) receptor subtypes are associated with anxiolytic, myorelaxant, and anticonvulsant activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What Is DXM?==
DXM is the active ingredient found in over the counter cough and cold medications. When taken in recommended doses, these medications are safe and effective.

==Health and Safety==
In very large quantities, DXM can cause effects similar to those of [[/ketamine/]] and [[/PCP/]] because these drugs affect similar sites in the brain. These effects can include impaired motor function, numbness, nausea/vomiting, and increased heart rate and blood pressure. On rare occasions, hypoxic brain damage—caused by severe respiratory depression and a lack of oxygen to the brain—has occurred due to the combination of DXM with decongestants often found in the medication.

'''NOTE!''' Abuse of cough medicine has more serious side effects then those listed here.  The amount of cough syrup which contains &quot;recreational&quot; dose of DXM can have a fatal dosage of its other active ingrediates.[http://de1.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_info2.html]

==Who's who in the tax system==

Income taxes in the United States are levied by the federal government and by state and local governments. The federal income tax, upon which this text focuses, is collected by the '''[[w:Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]]''' ('''IRS'''), part of the [[w:United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]. The rules for collecting income taxes are set in the '''Internal Revenue Code (IRC)''', Title 26 of the United States Code.  The IRC is a statute written and regularly revised by Congress. '''Treasury Regulations''' are more detailed rules written by the IRS to effectuate the implementation of the IRC. Code provisions, which are statutory, always trump contrary regulatory provisions. Regulations can be of two types: legislative and interpretive. With legislative regulations, Congress says, for example, that depreciation will be an allowable expense &quot;in accordance with regulations to be established by the IRS.&quot;  It gives the IRS the power to make the rules. Interpretive regulations are those in which the IRS says how it will interpret and apply a given statute.

Disputes over tax rules are generally heard in the '''United States Tax Court''' before the tax is paid, or in a '''United States District Court''' or '''United States Court of Federal Claims''' after the tax is paid. Appeals from the Tax Court go to the '''United States Court of Appeals''' for the circuit in which the taxpayer resides, or was domiciled when the tax return in controversy was originally filed.  From the Court of Appeals the taxpayer may file a ''writ of certiorari'' with the Supreme Court, which may or may not be granted. The IRS also periodically issues '''Revenue Rulings''' when taxpayers have questions about how to declare certain transactions. These rulings are only opinions, and are trumped by court rulings or contrary legislation.  Revenue Rulings should not be confused with '''Private Letter Rulings'''.  A Private Letter Ruling is a request by a specific taxpayer to the IRS to rule on the tax consequences of a specific transaction before the action is taken.  A Private Letter Ruling is directed ''only'' towards the requesting taxpayer, and therefore can not be relied upon by other taxpayers considering the exact action.  Private Letter Rulings are released every Friday by the IRS

==How tax is calculated==

The actual computation of tax is a straightforward process that can be performed by hand using IRS worksheets, or by computer using special tax software. The basic steps are as follows:

# The taxpayer computes their '''gross income''', including '''ordinary gains''' and '''losses'''.
# The taxpayer subtracts '''capital gains''' which are taxed separately from other income.
# The taxpayer subtracts '''business deductions''' and other '''above the line deductions''' to find their '''adjusted gross income'''.
# The taxpayer subtracts their '''personal exemption'''.
# The taxpayer adds up '''itemized deductions''', and either subtracts that sum or their '''standard deduction''', whichever is greater, to find their '''taxable income'''.
# The taxpayer multiplies their taxable income by various percentages to compute their '''tentative tax liability'''.
# The taxpayer subtracts '''tax credits''' to find their final tax liability.

==Accounting==

Accounting is important to discussions of tax law, because it determines ''when'' a receipt becomes taxable income and when a payment becomes deductible. Individuals and corporations generally compute their taxable income on a '''cash method''' or an '''accrual method''' and it is on this taxable income that the tax liability is based.

===The cash method===

The cash method is primarily used by individuals and small businesses. Under a cash system, generally, transactions count as income in the year of actual receipt, and count as deductions in the year of actual payment. There are some exceptions:

* Some transactions are counted as income before they are actually received because of the doctrine of '''prior constructive receipt'''.
* '''Amortized capital expenditures''', deductions on certain business assets, are not deducted immediately. 
* Interest is deductible when paid, but '''prepaid interest''' is not.

===The accrual method===

The accrual method is primarily used by large businesses which want to keep their income statements and their actual cash flow separate. Goods inventories are generally tracked using the accrual method, so any retail business is likely to use accrual accounting, and many businesses selling goods ancillary to their services may have to use accrual accounting as well.

In addition to the foregoing two methods there are also &quot;Special methods of accounting for certain items of income and expenses&quot; and &quot;Combination (hybrid) methods using elements of two or more of the foregoing.&quot;  For a non-authoritative but more extensive discussion of all these methods, including when they may and may not be used, and who may and may not use them, see IRS Publication 538, ''Accounting Periods and Methods''.  It should be noted that this discussion of the various methods is for the purpose of income taxes and '''not''' for the purpose of preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
====Income====

An accrual-based taxpayer has income when:

# all events have occurred that fix the right to the income and
# the amount of the income can be determined with reasonable accuracy.

''Charles Schwab Corp. v. Commr.'', 107 T.C. 282 (1996), dealt with this question in the context of securities brokerage, where parties become bound to a transaction on the &quot;trade date&quot; but do not actually perform the transaction until a &quot;settlement date&quot; a few days later. Schwab and the IRS disputed whether the &quot;all events&quot; test was satisfied on the trade date. The court ruled that Schwab had to accrue its income on the trade date, because the execution of the trade was a condition precedent fixing Schwab's right to receive its commission on the settlement date.

Under the '''claim of right''' doctrine, a taxpayer has income whenever they receive an amount under a claim of right and without restriction to its use. This means that in some transactions, where an accrual-based taxpayer receives a payment before their right to the payment has been fixed (a &quot;pre-payment&quot;), they recognize income when they actually receive the payment. The main exception to this rule is for security deposits, which are generally not received under a claim of right. Another exception is for non-profit membership organizations such as AAA, which receive prepayments for services: under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-E-II-B-456.html Section 456], they are allowed to defer their income across the period of liability to perform the services.

====Deductions====

An accrual-based taxpayer has a deduction when:

# all events have occurred that fix the liability for the deduction and
# the amount of the deduction can be determined with reasonable accuracy and
# economic performance has occurred with respect to the liability.

One well-known contest regarding the &quot;all events&quot; test was ''Mooney Aircraft v. U.S.'', 420 F.2d 400 (1969). Mooney sold each of its aircraft with a &quot;Mooney Bond&quot; promising to pay the bearer $1,000 when the aircraft was retired from service. Mooney tried to deduct the value of each bond in the year of issue; the IRS argued that the value of a bond could only be deducted when the aircraft was retired. The court sided with the IRS, noting that &quot;the longer the time the less probable it becomes that the liability, though incurred, will ever in fact be paid... the very purpose of the 'all events' test is to make sure that the taxpayer will not deduct expenses that might never occur.&quot;

The &quot;economic performance&quot; requirement applies to deductions, but not to income. The rationale of the requirement, which was added in 1984, is that many business liabilities do not require actual payment until a distant point in the future, and many such liabilities can be easily overstated to reduce (or eliminate) tax liability. Under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-E-II-C-461.html Section 461], economic performance occurs when property or services are provided or used, or when payments are made in the case of workers' compensation and tort claims.

==Annual accounting==

Regardless of whether they use a cash or accrual method, all taxpayers follow a system of '''annual accounting'''. Income taxes are always levied on a year-by-year basis, and each year is &quot;compartmentalized&quot; from the previous year and the next year. This means that if a taxpayer loses money in year 1 but has a higher income in year 2, they must still pay taxes on their income in year 2 even if the income is only enough to offset their previous loss. This is a general rule, and like most general rules, it has many exceptions.

===Tax benefit doctrine===

When a taxpayer has an expense, takes a deduction for that expense, but then recovers the expense later, they have income in the year they recover the expense. This principle is known as the '''tax benefit doctrine'''. A corollary to the tax benefit doctrine is [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-III-111.html Section 111], which establishes that recovery of an expense is ''not'' income if the taxpayer did ''not'' get a tax benefit from the expense.

===Income under semblance of unrestricted right===

What if a taxpayer receives something and believes they have a right to it, but later has to pay it back? In some situations, [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-Q-V-1341.html Section 1341] allows the taxpayer to deduct their previous income when it was received with a &quot;semblance&quot; of an unrestricted right.

===Net operating losses===

Businesses also have an option to &quot;carry back&quot; and &quot;carry over&quot; their net operating losses for the year. Under [http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-A-1-B-VI-172.html Section 172], carrybacks are available to the two years preceding the loss year, and carryovers are available to the next twenty years. This allows operating losses to offset income in other years, &quot;flattening&quot; the business's tax liability. Generally, the losses must be applied against income in the earliest year possible (i.e. the earliest year where there is income), but a business can elect to waive its carryback and save losses for carryover only.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called H i-c h-a M. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name H i-c h-a M~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Immunology is the study of the organs, cells, and chemical components of the immune system.  The immune system creates both ''innate'' and ''adaptive'' immune responses.  The innate response exists in many lower species, all the way up the evolutionary ladder to humans, and it acts through relatively crude means against large classes of pathogens.  The adaptive response is unique to vertebrates, reacting to foreign invaders with specificity and selectivity.hb

The immune system must maintain a delicate balance, with potent defensive responses capable of destroying large numbers of foreign cells and viruses while refraining from undue destruction of the host's body.  When the immune system cannot mount a sufficient defense of the host, there is an immune deficiency; this is seen in HIV infection and SCID .  If, on the other hand, the immune system acts too vigorously and begins to attack the host, we have autoimmunity.  This is a defiance of the integral immune system property of self/nonself recognition.  That is, the immune system begins attacking or forming antibodies against the host's own body tissues.  Examples of autoimmune diseases include Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, ''myaesthenia gravis'' and type I diabetes mellitus.  

==The History of Immunology==
The human immune system recognizes non-self entities and mounts an 
effector response to neutralize the organism.  A faster and stronger 
memory response may occur upon later exposure.  The memory response has 
been used throughout history to confer immunity upon several 
populations, even previous to our understanding of the physiological 
basis for such a response.  Thucydides wrote in his History of the 
Peloponnesian War that persons who had been exposed to plague previously 
could care for the sick without danger.  In the 19th century, 
variolation was commonplace; this was the removal of smallpox (variola 
virus) skin pustules which were subsequently put into small cuts in the 
skin of healthy people.  This was itself a crude form of vaccination, 
with the crusty dry pustules acting as an incubator of attenuated virus. 
Edward Jenner would later use the cowpox virus to vaccinate (from 
''vacca'', Latin for &quot;cow&quot;) patients against smallpox, and Louis Pasteur 
attenuated rabies and injected it into a small boy, naming this 
substance a vaccine in honor of Jenner's earlier studies in the science 
of immunology.

As immunology progressed, many people began to question how these 
vaccines worked.  Why should exposure to plague in Thucycides' time 
confer protection only against plague and not all disease?  Why should 
cowpox, a similar disease to smallpox but clearly a less severe virus, 
give milk maids sufficient immunity to resist full smallpox infection?  
In short, what has caused this memory response to be relatively (yet not 
absolutely) specific as well as selective?

==The Basics==
First, some vocabulary:
*Serum--liquid, noncellular component of blood after coagulation has occurred (and thus devoid of clotting factors).
*Immunoglobulin--a serum fraction (aka gamma globulin) that has antitoxin, precipitin, and agglutin factors (abbreviation: Ig)
*Antigen--&quot;'''Anti'''body '''Gen'''erator&quot;; a foreign organism or molecule that generates a humoral immune response, causing the release of antibodies (abbreviation: Ag)
*Epitope--the molecular sidechain of an antigen that each antibody attaches to; there can be many epitopes on a single antigen
*Antibody--refined, Y-shaped proteins that make up the immunoglobulin fraction of serum; antibodies are specific to certain foreign bodies; antibodies can be membrane-bound or free in the serum (abbreviation: Ab)
Note: Often, antibody and immunoglobulin are used interchangably. antigen and immunogen are used interchangably(but to be precise, they are not the same)

There have been several competing theories of the immune response mechanism.  The '''instructional theory''' of antigen interaction postulated that the antigen itself caused antibodies to fold around the antigen in a certain way; this theory was later disproven.  The '''selection theory''' states that the body creates many different sidechains on antibodies, and the antigen &quot;selects&quot; the correct antibody; in other words, the body creates every possible permutation of chemical sidechain-specific antibodies, and when an antigen enters the body, it is matched up with antibodies that correspond to its epitopes.  The current theory of immune response is known as the '''clonal selection theory''', which states that an individual lymphocyte (specifically, a B cell) expresses receptors specific to the distinct antigen, determined before the antibody ever encounters the antigen.  Binding of Ag to a cell activates the cell, causing a proliferation of clone daughter cells.

==Innate Immunity==
Innate immunity is basic and nonspecific.  It includes:
*Phagocytic cells (macrophages, neutrophils; more generally, 
antigen-presenting cells (APCs))
*Barriers (e.g. skin)
*Antimicrobial compounds
*Inflammation

===Phagocytic Cells===
Certain cells &quot;eat up&quot; foreign invaders; this is termed phagocytosis.  
Many of these cells are known as Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs) because they break apart the ingested pathogen and display certain epitopes of the antigen on their surface.  In this way, they localize the presentation of antigen, forming a vital link between the innate 
response and the adaptive response.  Lymphocytes (such as B cells and T-helper cells) will have antigen presented to them, initiating the 
adaptive response.  Monocyte-derived cells are common APCs, and they include tissue macrophages and monocytes within the blood; eutrophils 
are also APCs.  APCs are discussed further below, in the section on cells of the immune system.  

===Barriers===
The skin contains epidermis and dermis.  The epidermis contains tightly packed epithelial (cytokeratin positive) cells with keratin waterproofing.  The dermis contains connective tissue blood vessels hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands.  Sebaceous glands 
secrete '''sebum'''; this contains fatty acids and lactic acid, lowering skin pH to 3-5.  

Mucous membranes contain normal flora, mucus, and cilia.  Mucous membranes are found in the nose, eyes, mouth, urogenital, and anal 
regions of the body.  Flora refers to bacteria that inhabit the human body in a relative steady-state; the gastro-intestinal tract contains a large number of these bacteria, and different areas of the world contain different flora.  It is for this reason that people contract Traveler's Diarrhea; in short, flora from one region of the world are more dangerous because the body has not acclimated to their presence.  Mucus contains certain mucin proteins, inorganic salts, and water; it is secreted from goblet cells.  Cilia acts to sway back and forth during two phases, known as the power stroke and the recovery stroke; this allows mucus to be swept out of the body, either proximodistally from the lungs up the respiratory tract, or down the GI tract through the intestines, culminating in defecation.  The enteric nervous system causes contractions of the gut, moving foodstuffs, waste, and bacteria/toxins down the digestive tract.  This is just one example of disparate systems of the body working together with the immune system proper.  Other examples are skeletal muscles, which squeeze blood along the veins and lymph along the lymph vessels, or the nervous system, which supports a rise in body temperature in response to infection.  

Some bacteria can attach to mucous membranes via '''fimbriae''' or '''pili''', which attach to special glyoproteins/glycolipids on the 
epithelial cells of mucous membranes.

===Antimicrobial Compounds===
Several antimicrobial compounds mediate the innate response.
*'''Lysozyme'''--hydrolytic enzyme in tears and mucous; cleaves 
peptidoglycan in bacterial cell walls
*'''Interferon'''--produced by virus-infected cells; binds to nearby 
cells (it is a paracrine factor), inducing a generalized antiviral state
*'''Complement'''--inactive circulating serum proteins that act on 
pathogen cell membranes
*'''Collectins'''--surfactant materials; kills bacteria by disrupting 
their lipid membranes or agglutinating them
*'''Toll-Like Receptors'''---(TLRs) membrane-bound receptors that react 
via pattern recognition to certain classes of molecules; TLR4, for 
example, recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gram-negative bacteria

===Inflammation===
Classical biology put several characteristics together as an inflammatory response.  These included redness (erythema, ''rubor''), 
heat (''calor''), swelling (edema, ''tumor''), pain (''dolor''), and loss of function (''functio laesa'').  The physiological processes that bring about these symptoms are central to the innate immune response.

Erythema results from constriction of post-capillary venules in tissue 
beds and vasodilation in pre-capillary arterioles/metarterioles.  This 
results in an increase of hydrostatic pressure in the capillary bed, 
overcoming the osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid and causing 
'''exudate''' (high-protein fluid with acute-phase proteins like 
C-reactive protein and macrophages) to flow into the interstitial 
tissue.  This flowing of exudate also allows the factors of the clotting cascade to enter areas of tissue damage, forming clots and, eventually, scars.  Certain inflammatory factors also cause phagocytic cells to enter the damaged tissue.  The now-permeable capillaries are traversed 
by these phagocytes in response to '''chemotaxis''', the release of 
factors that lure the cells to the site of injury.  The cells first 
approach the side of a capillary ('''margination'''), move through the 
spaces between capillary endothelial cells ('''diapedesis'''), and then 
enter the tissue itself.  '''Histamine''' helps to mediate this 
response, and certain factors (such as bradykinin and possibly 
prostaglandins) stimulate skin pain receptors.  Thus, blood flows into 
the tissue, causing redness, warmer steady-state temperature, swelling, 
and pain; loss of function is a secondary effect of these four states.

==Adaptive Immunity==
Adaptive immunity occurs in response to antigen exposure.  It is 
specific, and it shows memory.  As long as an antigen is made of the 
normal chemical elements we experience in biological systems (e.g. 
Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulfur, Hydrogen, Oxygen), we can form an adaptive 
response to it.  This is how we fight off new diseases, and it has even 
been shown that we can create antigens in the laboratory that have never before existed on Earth, only to have animals mount competent immune 
reactions to them. As stated earlier, the adaptive immune system's 
specificity is tempered with an ability to differentiate between self 
and non-self antigen; simply put, the body doesn't attack its own cells, unless they have been invaded by virus and ask to be sacrificed for the sake of the host.  When the immune system does attack the body, this is a disease state: autoimmunity.  

The primary response takes 5-6 days, but the memory (secondary) response will be swifter and deadlier.  It includes:
*Lymphocytes
*Antibodies

===Lymphocytes===
Blood cells are made in the bone marrow of adults.  Leukocytes are white blood cells (WBCs).  This includes monocytes (which become myriad cell 
types in the body, most importantly macrophages), granulocytes 
(neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils), and lymphocytes.  Of all the 
leukocytes, the lymphocyte class are the most preeminent in the adaptive immune response.  On a peripheral blood smear, lymphocytes are 
approximately the size of erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs), although they can be larger if activated and have a characteristic &quot;clock-face&quot; nucleus if they are B cells.  Lymphocytes are so named because fewer 
than 1% are present in the circulating blood; the rest lie in the lymph 
nodes, spleen and other lymphoid organs.  '''T lymphocytes''' leave the 
bone marrow, travelling to the thymus gland, where they mature and gain 
their specificity for the diverse antigens the body might come into 
contact with; additionally, any T cells that react against the body's 
own epitopes are selected against (killed) in the thymus, in an effort 
to stop any possible autoimmunity.  A similar process occurs in the bone marrow in the case of '''B lymphocytes'''.  B cells are conveniently 
named (&quot;B for bone marrow&quot;), but this is just a coincidence; it turns 
out that they are named B cells after the Bursa of Fabricius, a small 
pouch in the cloaca (lower large intestine, ''cloaca'' Latin for 
&quot;sewer&quot;) of birds.  

B cells leave the bone marrow with their specific membrane bound Ig 
(antibody) already specified.  The Ig itself is made up of two medial 
heavy chains (both identical) with two lateral light chains (also 
identical) attached to the &quot;top&quot; of the heavy chains, which form a Y 
shape.  Before they encounter antigen, B cells are known as &quot;naive.&quot;  
Once they encounter antigen, the naive B cells will undergo clonal 
expansion; an activated B cell will form some daughter '''memory B 
cells''' and some '''plasma cells'''.  The memory cells will lie in wait for a second encounter with the antigen, while the plasma cells will 
begin a ''massive'' secretion of antibody (Ig).  '''B cells can bind to 
antigen when it is free and unprocessed in the body, much like APCs 
can.'''  

Before moving on to T lymphocytes, it should be noted that certain cell 
surface molecules distinguish each person's unique immune system 
profile.  The '''Major Histocompatibility Complex''' (MHC, or HLA) is a 
type of protein expressed on the surface of host cells that interacts 
with T-cell receptors (TCRs) of T cells.  Virtually all the body's 
cells, including APCs, express class I MHC (MHC-I) on their surface.  
Only APCs express class II MHC (MHC-II).  Thus, most body cells express 
MHC-I, while APCs express both MHC-I ''and'' MHC-II.  When antigen 
enters a body cell and is broken down, the products of this breakdown 
are sent to the surface of the cell coupled with MHC-I.  This forms the 
MHC-I/Ag complex, and usually occurs when a virus or bacterium enter a cell and are broken down by intracellular defenses.  This can also occur in APCs, but APCs additionally process the antigen that they 
phagocytose, presenting it as an MHC-II/Ag complex on the surface of 
their cells. 

T cells can be subdivided into two broad types: T helper cells and T 
cytotoxic cells.  T helper cells express a T-Cell Receptor (TCR) that 
will interact with APC surfaces.  Specifically, they interact with the 
MHC-II/Ag complex on the surface of APCs, and the TCR is stabilized in 
its binding by a CD4 receptor. CD stands for &quot;cluster of 
differentiation,&quot; and is simply a class of cell receptor which occurs 
predominantly on T cells.  T helper cells contain CD4 receptors and T 
cytotoxic cells contain CD8 receptors.  Upon binding, T helper cells 
release '''cytokines''', which act as chemotactic agents to call for 
more T helper cells, T cytotoxic cells, APCs, and B cells.  

T cytotoxic cells encounter body cells that have been invaded and are 
presenting MHC-I/Ag on their surface.  Tc cells extend their TCR to the 
MHC-I/Ag complex and stabilize this interaction with their CD8 receptor 
arms. Upon binding, the CD8+ cells differentiate, much like naive B 
cells, into memory T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), effector 
cells that cause the MHC-I/Ag-presenting cell (the &quot;altered self cell&quot;) 
to die (apoptose). CTLs trigger apoptosis by secreting a perforin that 
allows the entry of a serine protease (Granzyme B) which activates 
intracellular executioner caspases.  It should be noted that cancer 
cells can also become altered self cells, and CTLs are very important in the destruction of cancerous cells.    
'''T cells can interact with antigen ''only'' after it has been 
processed, either by a normal body cell (MHC-I) or by an APC 
(MHC-II).'''

Difference between the two types of T cells:
*T helper cells react to exogenous antigen, phagocytosed by APCs, 
presented on MHC-II, via binding with TCR and CD4.  
*T cytotoxic cells react to endogenous antigen (such as viral or cancer 
proteins), broken down by lysosomes in many types of body cells, 
presented on MHC-I, via binding with TCR and CD8.

Note that it is both the antigen and the MHC that is presented to T 
cells; each person has a unique MHC.  This is why we must type for bone 
marrow transplants--we don't want people producing tons of new immune 
cells in bone marrow that think every MHC in the body is actually just 
antigen; when this does occur, it is called '''graft-vs.-host 
disease'''.  Not only would the new bone marrow make cells that attacked every body cell's MHC, but when the body did present Ag on MHC, the 
lymphocytes from the transplant would not be able to recognize this 
MHC-I/Ag complex (although the MHC-II complex cells would be made in the new bone marrow, and thus APCs could, in some cases, still present). 
Unfortunately, these APCs would be very busy presenting the host's own 
body cells; clearly MHC typing (also known as HLA typing) for bone 
marrow transplants is a necessary result of the elegant self-nonself 
recognition of the human immune system.  It is also worth noting that we are only as good as our presenting molecules.  Some people have MHC 
genes that are not as good at presenting antigen, and thus some people 
have more vigorous immune respones than others.

===Antibodies===
The cellular and humoral responses of the adaptive immune system are 
linked via the T helper cell-B cell interaction.  The T helper cell 
secretes cytokine factors to encourage chemotaxis of B cells to the site of infection as well as B cell differentiation and growth.  B cells 
themselves, in their effector plasma B cell form, release antibodies 
into the blood.
Antigens, or foreign substances that enter the body,are very harmful to 
the Immune System. But when specific antibodies are produced to bind 
with an antigen, the foreign substance becomes harmless and is delivered to the lymph. Antibodies are also very important in the complement 
system; this is an example of the vertebral adaptive immune response 
making good use of the relatively primitive innate immune response.  
Antibodies to the body's own cells are a very real danger.  Type I 
diabetes may be caused by an autoimmune response, where the body makes 
antibodies to its own Beta cells in the pancreatic Islets of Langerhans.  Graves' disease is a condition where the body produces antibodies to 
receptors in the follicular cells of the thyroid; these Ab keep the 
cells constantly activated, giving the patient hyperthyroidism and 
increasing their metabolism, to adverse effect.  The interesting 
counterpoint to this is Hashimoto's thyroiditis; here the body makes 
antibodies to thyroid follicular cells' receptors, but in this case the 
cells are shut down by the Ab, and the patient endures 
''hypo''thyroidism.  

Autoimmunity due to antibody overreaction (hypersensitivity) is a huge 
problem, and it is a much greater problem in women than in men.  Women 
tend to have a higher titer of immunoglobulin (antibody), and thus they 
exert a stronger (and sometimes overwhelming) immune response.  For 
example, for every one man who gets Graves' disease, 8 women will 
contract it. 

Antibodies are often given to produce a short-lived humoral immunity in 
emergency situations.  Many antivenoms are actually horse 
immunoglobulin, produced in order to bind the venom until it can be 
cleared from the body.

It should be noted that all of the above-mentioned immune responses result in the destruction or agglutination of foreign pathogen.  The goal of the immune response is three-fold:
#Destroy foreign antigen via innate or humoral responses such as complement fixation or endocytosis by macrophages.
#Attract immune cells to the site of infection so they can engulf, process and present the antigen to T cells
#Move the antigen to the site of differentiation (e.g. lymph nodes, thymus) via the lymphatic system, so that it can interact with naive B cell.  This process creates new effector and memory cells which can return to the site of infection and destroy the foreign cells in a highly effective fashion via the adaptive response.

The immune responses listed above show the intimate interaction between the innate and adaptive immune systems, as well as the subclasses of adaptive responses.  The '''clonal selection''' theory of immune response, introduced above, is clear in the action of lymphocytes.  Clonal selection simply means that antigen is presented to many circulating naive B and (via MHC) T cells, and the lymphocytes that match the antigen are &quot;selected&quot; to form clones of themselves, both memory and effector.  This mass production of daughter cells is termed '''clonal expansion''', and it is essential in the understanding of the theoretical basis of immunology.  Not only this; clonal selection is used negatively in the lymphoid organs.  Here, the body's own epitopes are presented to the infant lymphocytes; those that react are recognized as traitors and destroyed before they (and their future cloned daughters) can leave and wreak havoc in the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The organs of the immune system are positioned throughout the body. They are called lymphoid organs because they are home to lymphocytes, small white bloodcells that are the key players in the immune system. {{TOCright}}
There are two groups of immune system organs.
*Primary (central)--organs where ''immature'' lymphocytes develop
**Thymus
**Bone marrow
*Secondary (peripheral)--tissues where antigen is localized so that it can be effectively exposed to ''mature'' lymphocytes
**Lymph nodes
**Appendix
**Peyer's Patches (of GI tract)
**Tonsils
**Adenoids
**Spleen
**MALT ('''M'''ucosal-'''A'''ssociated '''L'''ymphoid '''T'''issue)
***GALT ('''Gut'''-'''A'''ssociated '''L'''ymphoid '''T'''issue)
***BALT ('''B'''ronchial/Tracheal-'''A'''ssociated '''L'''ymphoid '''T'''issue)
***NALT ('''N'''ose-'''A'''ssociated '''L'''ymphoid '''T'''issue)
***VALT ('''V'''ulvovaginal-'''A'''ssociated '''L'''ymphoid '''T'''issue)

''Note: Some sources place the vermiform appendix, small intestine Peyer's Patches, tonsils, and adenoids within the GALT.'' 

==Thymus==
The thymus (from θυμος, thumos, Greek for warty outgrowth) is the site of T cell maturation.  T cells become immunocompetent here; that is, they develop their ability to mount an effective immune response against foreign invaders without attacking the host's own tissues.  The thymus lies just above the heart in the mediastinum.  It is largest in childhood, and it begins to shrink significantly as a person ages.  The organ itself contains two lobes, and each lobe contains numerous lobules, separated from each other by connective tissue septa known as trabeculae.  Each lobule is separated into an inner medulla (with few immature thymocytes) and an outer cortex (with large numbers of immature thymocytes).  In the thymus, the many different T cells (produced via somatic genetic mutation, discussed below) are exposed to MHC/Ag and MHC/self-Ag.  If they do ''not'' react to MHC/Ag, they are destroyed due to their ineffectiveness ('''positive selection''').  On the other hand, if they ''do'' react to MHC/self-AG, they are destroyed in order to stop them from becoming traitorous autoimmune responses against the body's own tissue('''negative selection''').   Only 1 out of 20 immature thymocytes will pass successfully through this vetting process and become functional T cells.  Dendritic cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells are interspersed throughout both the medulla and cortex; special epithelial nurse cells surround clusters of thymocytes in the cortex.

'''Myasthenia gravis''' is an autoimmune disease where the body creates antibodies against acetylcholine receptors at post-synaptic neuromuscular junctions.  In up to 25% of MG cases, there is a tumor of the thymus present (thymoma); the exact reasons for this tumor development is unknown.  Additionally, removal of the thymoma will halt the disease's progress; this deserves further study as antibodies are released from plasma B cells rather than T cells, yet T helper cells may mediate the autoimmunity. 

'''DiGeorge's Syndrome''' is a congenital lack of a thymus, and causes in increase in infections and a depressed immune system (especially the cell-mediated response is retarded by the lack of a thymus).

==Bone Marrow==
Bone marrow (medulla ossea) is the site of B cell maturation in mice and humans.  B cells undergo both positive and negative selection, similar to T cell maturation in the thymus.  Bone marrow is also the site of hematopoiesis, the development of the myriad blood cells from progenitor cells.  The site of B cell maturation in birds is the bursa of Fabricius, after which B cells are named. The tissue of bone marrow where leukocytes, red blood cells, and platelets develop (i.e., the site of hematopoiesis) is known as myeloid tissue.  

'''Leukemia''' is a cancer of the bone marrow that causes abnormal production of leukocytes (WBCs).  
*Acute leukemia is the biggest killer of children in the US; it results from the overgrowth of immature leukocytes in the bone marrow, retarding the production of functional WBCs, RBCs, and platelets.  
*Chronic leukemia is the overgrowth of relatively mature (but abnormal) leukocytes in the bone marrow.   
*Lymphocytic leukemia is the overgrowth of lymphoid cells (T cells, B cells, Natural Killer Cells, dendritic cells).
*Myeloid leukemia is the overgrowth of myeloid cells (all blood cell types that are not lymphocytic are produced from myeloid progenitor stem cells).

==Lymph Nodes==
Extracellular fluid flows from capillary beds into tissue; from this tissue it enters lymphatic capillaries that are &quot;pumped&quot; along with the movement of skeletal muscle towards lymph nodes.  The paracortical areas of the nodes contain T cells, and the central areas contain '''germinal centers''', where B cells are contained.  APCs and antigen are sent from the tissue into the lymphatics, eventually reaching the lymph nodes where they can be exposed to the T and B cell populations.  This allows a faster response, as the many combinations of T and B cell specificities are able to reside in several locations throughout the body (the lymph nodes) rather than relying on random meetings of antigen and lymphocytes throughout the tissues themselves.

==Spleen==
The spleen acts as a site of hematopoiesis during the second and third trimesters of development, before the long bones have fully developed.  In the adult, the spleen acts as a site for breakdown of dying red blood cells (lifespan 120 days).  For this reason, enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) can occur in sickle cell anemia or in certain infections.  White pulp, near the arteriolar entry points into the spleen, is where lymphocytes reside and are degraded.  The central red pulp is the site of RBCs breakdown.  The white pulp region has a central part, with the T cells residing in the '''PALS, or PeriArteriolar Lymphoid Sheath''' and a B cell ring (or corona) surrounding the PALS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hematopoiesis==
Stem cells, like the stem of a plant, are cells that branch off into other cell types (hence the name).  Hematopoiesis is the generation of blood cells in the bone marrow.  Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) are cells within the bone marrow that maintain their own population through cell division while branching off some daughter cells to form subspecialized sets of cell-types.  

During the embryonic stage however, humans do not yet have long bones but are still able to accomplish hematopoesis.  The yolk sac acts as the site of hematopoiesis for the first several months of gestation, and in the second and third trimesters the fetal liver and spleen take over hematopoietic duties.  Gradually, during the final trimester, the hematopoetic duties are handed over to the long bones of the fetus.

By parturition, hematopoiesis has become localized to the bone marrow itself.  Most cells can multiply via division into cells like themselves, and thus are known to be unipotent.  If a cell can differentiate into any cell type, it is called ''totipotent''; a zygote's first dividing cells, and some embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are totipotent.  HSCs are known as ''pluripotent'' or ''multipotent'', meaning they can reproduce themselves (creating a store of unending stem cells) while having other cell-types branch off of their foundation stem, becoming several other types of cells.

The following is a list of the final differentiated types of cells that HSCs can become:

*Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSCs renew their stocks)
*Lymphoid Progenitor Cell
**Natural Killer Cell (NK Cell)
**Dendritic Cell
***Monocyte-derived dendritic cell
***Plasmacytoid dendritic cell
**T Cell Progenitor
***CD4+ T Helper Cell
***CD8+ T Cytotoxic Cell
**B Cell Progenitor
*Myeloid Progenitor Cell
**Mast Cell
**Dendritic Cell
**Granulocyte-Monocyte Progenitor Cell
***Monocyte
***Neutrophil ('''leukocytosis''' is high neutrophils and is used clinically to indicate infection; also known as polys, segs, and PMNs, Polymorphonucleophages)
**Eosinophil Progenitor Cell
***Eosinophil
**Basophil Progenitor Cell
***Basophil
**Megakaryocyte
***Platelets
**Erythoid Progenitor Cell
***Erythrocyte (RBC)
All of these cell types are created in the bone marrow.  Throughout the body's tissues, monocytes and B cells can specialize further.  
B cells will become
*plasma cells (effector B cells)
*memory B cells
Monocytes can become any of the following vimentin+ cells:
*circulating blood monocytes
*cardiac failure cells (in alveoli)
*alveolar macrophages
*epithelial macrophages
*Mesangial Cells (in the kidney glomerulus)
*Kupffer Cells (in liver)
*Ito Cells (in liver)
*histiocytes (in connective tissue)
*Microglial cells (in brain)
*Osteoclasts (in lamellar bone)

NK1-T cells are a special set of rapid-response cells that have TCRs but interact with CD1 rather than MHC-I or MHC-II.  These cells are a sort of NK cell/T cell hybrid.  When activated, NK1-T cells recruit both cytotoxic T cells and B cells.  

Returning to the bone marrow itself, certain growth factors and cytokines must be present in cell microenvironments in order for these cells to go down one differentiation pathway or another.  Much like the stroma (supportive tissue) of an organ, the stromal cells of the bone marrow assist in hematopoiesis both by creating a scaffolding upon which the stem cells grow and differentiate while also secreting factors that influence and encourage growth.

==Apoptosis==
Apoptosis is programmed cell death via disintegration of the cell into membrane-bound pieces which are then phagocytized.  The purpose of apoptosis is to destroy cells in an ordered way without releasing the possibly toxic intracellular chemicals and components into the extracellular tissue.  Necrosis is death of a cell based on injury or disease and does not employ similar safeguards.  Several genes act to influence apoptosis.  They include:
*Apoptosis Inhibitors
**bcl-2
**bcl-X long
*Apoptosis Enhancers
**bax (inhibits bcl-2)
**bcl-X short (inhibits bcl-X long)
**caspases
**fas

==T Cell Responses==
T cells can initiate several different responses.  
*TH1 Response--mostly inflammatory, recruits T cells and macrophages
*TH2 Response--mostly antibody-mediated, recruits B cells
Certain cells act to supress a T cell-mediated response, and are known as suppressor T cells.  It is unknown whether there is an actual Ts subpopulation or if Tc and Th cells simply act in a suppressor role in some cases.

==Natural Killer Cells==
NK cells act to attach to IgG antibodies on the surface of cancerous or virus-infected cells.  In this way, they connect the humoral (B cell) and cell-mediated responses.  For this reason, NK cells are central to something known as '''antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)'''.

==Macrophage Responses==
Macrophages phagocytize foreign invaders after chemotaxic factors lure the macrophages to sites of infection.  Certain factors that attach to the invading cells (e.g. antibodies) or break open the invading cells' walls (e.g. complement system) act as opsonins (from a Greek word for &quot;tasty').  Opsonization is thus the alteration of a foreign invader to make it more palatable to the macrophage's reactions.  Macrophages release certain compounds call '''Reactive Oxygen Intermediates (ROIs)''' to kill invading cells in something known as the '''respiratory burst'''.  ROIs include H2O2 and oxygen radicals.  Melanocytes are important in the degradation of these compounds, which act to destroy invader DNA but also endanger host DNA at times; for this reason melanocytes are found in the skin, where they neutralize radicals caused by UV light; interestingly melanocytes are also found in the dark internal esophagus, where they function to destroy radicals produced by acid reflux out of the stomach.  Macrophages also release certain compounds like lysozyme, '''defensin''' peptides (which form holes in cell membranes, much like complement) and '''tumor necrosis factor alpha''' (which can kill certain cancer cells).  Macrophages also secrete certain complement proteins (although the liver produces most complement proteins) and interleukins, which help in the inflammatory response.

'''Chronic granulomatous disease''' is a genetic malfunction where the body does not produce NADPH oxidase.  This retards the macrophages' ability to create Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Intermediates (ROIs &amp; RNIs), predisposing afflicted patients to infections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Antigens''' are substances that react with naive B cells when free-floating or with T cells when processed and displayed on cell surfaces along with MHC molecules.  

Both antigens and '''haptens''' (small molecules) can act as antigenic agents when faced with an active immune response in progress.  But ''only'' antigens themselves can cause an immune response to begin; they are both antigenic and immunogenic.  Anything that can start an immune response can react with an in-progess immune response, but some compounds cannot start an immune response (although we can make antibodies to them and an in-progress response will react with them). This is the difference between something that is immunogenic and antigenic.  

What makes something immunogenic (capable of creating a full immune response)?
*heterogeneity (different amino acids, rather than synthetic monopolymers)
*foreigness (must be different from host's proteins)
*size (must be relatively large, e.g. 100 kDalton)

Because of the nature of antibody molecules, proteins and polysaccharides are the most common humoral antigens.  Proteins are broken down and presented with MHC molecules to produce the cell-mediated immune response, and lipids/glycolipids are similarly presented (although they are presented on CD1 at the cell surface).  Leprosy and tuberculosis are presented to the T cells in this CD1/lipid manner.

Immunogens are often given deliberately, as in the case of vaccines.  Often they are complexed with '''adjuvants''', compounds that enhance the vaccine.  Adjuvants can include broken-up bacterial cell walls, oil (to slow the dispersion of the vaccine into the body), and water.  The addition of bacterial cell wall components induces the innate immune system to actuate, enhancing the adaptive system due to a higher concentration of MHC-II receptors on the APCs, resulting in more activated B cells.   

Remember that '''epitopes''' are the parts of an antigen that elicit an immune response.  It makes sense that B cell-recruiting epitopes are more likely to reside on the surface of foreign invaders, and these epitopes are likely to be hydrophilic.  T cell epitopes are more likely to be larger peptides, cleaved and presented with MHC-I and MHC--II on the surface of body cells and APCs.  Thus, the outer hydrophilic parts of an invader elicit B cell responses, and the relatively hydrophobic inner parts elicit T cell responses.  Also, denatured proteins are less likely to create a B cell response, but T cells are used to interacting, via their CD4 and CD8 receptors and TCRs, with broken-up peptides ('''antigenic peptides''').  

Haptens must join with carrier proteins in order to produce an immune response.  Drug allergies are almost always caused by drugs that are, by themselves, too small to be immunogenic.  Penicillin and other drugs will bind with nucleophilic sidechains on circulating body proteins, forming a hapten-carrier conjugate.  This causes antibodies (IgE) to the drug to be produced, and an allergic reaction begins when IgE-receptors on mast cells are activated.  Treatment with epinephrine will reverse the anaphylactic shock, diverting blood from the periphery and dilating the airways in a classical sympathetic response.  For this reason, persons with life-threatening allergies will often carry epinephrine (adrenaline) injections with them in case of exposure to the hapten.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Find out first – 
* what exactly it is for, &amp; what it needs to do
* what inputs it needs and where the data &amp; assumptions will come from
* what business logic is required
* what level of detail it needs to provide
* what flexibility is required – i.e. what needs to be able to change
* who will use it &amp; how, &amp; what are their skills
* how often it will be used, &amp; for how long
* how soon it is needed

For anything except a small model with a clearcut specification and design, it is a good idea - and essential in many cases - to document the specification clearly, 

It is extremely important to fully understand and document the business logic, i.e. all the business rules that need to go into the model. For example, most business models involve tax, so you’d expect some rules on how tax affects the model. As you will see, errors in logic – and especially omissions – are among the hardest to find – and they can be extremely dangerous.

You should always ensure you have copies of all relevant correspondence or documents, and anything that will help you understand the business. For example, if you are modelling a workers’ compensation portfolio, you would need documentation on the benefits that are paid, previous actuaries’ reports, publications that might indicate recent trends or issues, etc.

Where other people will be using the model, ensure you know their skill level and experience, and find out how they will use the model (e.g. daily or weekly; briefly or for hours on end; in depth, using all the features, or just using basic features; etc.). It doesn’t matter how clever your model is, if no-one can use it!
 
== Writing a specification ==

A specification is a written description of your model. It should cover
* what your model will and won’t do
* what data and other information it needs
* what results it will produce
* documentation and support (if applicable)
* maintenance (if applicable)
* timing
* cost

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}
Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are Y-shaped glycosylated proteins that are secreted by plasma B cells and reside in the membranes of activated effector B cells.  The two arms of the Y are formed from the '''Variable''' regions of the two '''Heavy''' chains (which form both the stalk and the medial portions of both Y arms) and the entire '''Light''' chains (which form the lateral portions of both Y arms).  The two arms of the antibody are known as the Fab fragments, as they are the portion that acts as an antibody, binding to antigen.  The parallel heavy chain stalks of the antibody are known as the Fc fragments, which are relatively ''constant'' across all antibody (immunoglobulin) subtypes.  There are certain '''hypervariable''', or '''Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs)''' at the very ends of the arms, that is the Variable regions, of the antibody.  The remainder of the Variable regions are known as '''Framework Regions'''.  Genetic shuffling will give each antibody (immunoglobulin) a specificity to certain antigenic epitopes.  Light chain proteins, secreted in excess in patients with '''multiple myeloma''' cancer of the plasma B cells, are known as '''Bence-Jones proteins''', and are one of the few large proteins in the body with a notable positive charge.  '''Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM)''' is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma that also causes increased B-J proteins; it is a rare condition that also results in large numbers of IgM proteins throughout the serum.  

Any of the Ig isotypes can contain one of two light chain subtypes, kappa κ (60%) or lambda λ (40%, with subtypes λ1, λ2, λ3).  

There are several classes of immunoglobulin, each of which has a similar but distinct basic Fc structure, although several Ig subtypes form oligomers.  The different subtypes of Ig are:
Short (350 aa Fc) Ig isotypes with a '''hinge region'''
*IgA (α Fc stalk)
**IgA1, IgA2
**Can be found in monomer, dimer, trimer, or tetramer form with joining (J) chain between the monomers
*IgG (γ Fc stalk)
**IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4
**Monomer only
*IgD (δ Fc stalk)
**Monomer only
Long (440 aa Fc) Ig isotypes with no hinge region
*IgE (ε Fc stalk)
**Monomer only
*IgM (μ Fc stalk)
**Monomer or pentamer only, with joining (J) chain at center of pentamer

Ig can be in a '''secretory sIg''' form or a '''membrane-bound mIg''' form.  Naive B cells have only mIgM; as they mature, they express both mIgM and mIgD.  Memory B cells can express mIgA, mIgG, mIgE, or mIgM (but not mIgD).  Thus, as some point between naive and memory status, B cells stop expressing mIgD.  Every B cell, be it memory or plasma, reacts against one specific epitope, even though a single cell can secrete or express on their membrane several different isotypes of Ig at once.  

Although the arms of the Ig Y structure are important for binding Ag, macrophages, NK cells (mediators of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC), and neutrophils have Fc receptors on their surface.  Thus, antibodies will attach to pathogens, and passing neutrophils and macrophages will attach to the Y stalk pointing outwards, eating up the pathogens with greater fervor.  Thus, Ig is an opsonizing agent.  

'''The Complement System''' can be activated by both IgM and IgG.  The complement system both
*forms pores in the cell membranes of target pathogen cells and
*attaches certain sticky proteins, such as C3b, which attach to RBCs and APCs, causing complement-attacked pathogens to be carried along with other blood cells to the liver and spleen for destruction

==Immunoglobulin A (IgA)==
*Secreted as dimer, with J (joining) chain between mononer substituents
*Most important secretory antibody, capable of passing across epithelial cell layers (transcytosis)
*Secreted in mother's milk to child
*''Huge'' amounts are secreted in the GI tract each day (~10g per day)
*sIgA-secreting plasma B cells interact with '''poly-Ig receptors''' on basalateral surfaces of mucosal cells, especially those close to the GI tract lumen

==Immunoglobulin G (IgG)==
*Passes through mucous membranes, and thus is partially secretory
*Crosses placenta from mother to fetus in third trimester (although IgG2 may not) via a '''neonatal Fc receptor'''
*Partial activator of the Complement System (IgG3&gt;IgG1&gt;IgG2; IgG4 does not activate complement)
*Fc regions bind very well to Fc receptors on neutrophils, NK cells, and macrophages (IgG1=IgG3&gt;IgG4&gt;IgG2)

==Immunoglobulin D (IgD)==
*Expressed on membrane of mature B cells

==Immunoglobulin E (IgE)==
*Fc regions bind very well to high affinity IgE receptors on Mast Cells (tissue) and basophils (blood), mediating their activation and release of histamine/heparin, and the production of multiple mediatiors inducing an allergic response. Low affinity IgE receptors, CD23, are also found on other cell types.

==Immunoglobulin M (IgM)==
*Expressed on membrane of mature B cells as monomer
*Expressed as a secretory pentamer, with monomer substituents joined by J (joining) chains
*First Ig produced by infant
*First Ig produced during primary (non-memory) immune response
*Major activator of the Complement System
*Shows some secretion across epithelial layers

==The B Cell Receptor==
Ig has a short cytoplasmic tail and must be complexed with a small dimer in order to form, altogether, the B Cell Receptor (BCR).  A small dimer with an Ig-β and Ig-α component.  This Ig-α is ''not'' related to the α Fc region of the IgA protein.  The relatively long cytoplasmic tails of this small dimer allow the different mIg isotypes to send signals within the B cell upon binding with antigen.

==Ig Classifications==
*'''Isotype'''--within a species, all individuals share a given isotype of the Ig (this is concerned with the conserved regions of the Ig constant region)
*'''Allotype'''--within a species, each individual will have a given allele that codes for their Ig constant region (thus, individuals generally have a unique allotype)
*'''Idiotype'''--within an individual, each B cell will create a unique variable region, specific for a given antigen; this is the idiotype of each Ig/Ab, and can be similar only when B cells are reacting to a similar antigen

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inflammation is characterized by four key symptoms:
#Redness-caused by warm blood flowing to the area
#Pain-caused by damage to nerve fibers or irritation to toxic chemicals
#Heat-also caused by warm blood flowing to the area
#Swelling-caused by fluid moving from the blood to the tissue spaces of the injured area

Inflammation can cause a loss of function in an injured area.  It traps microbes, toxins, and foreign material at the site of injury and prepares the site for tissue repair.  For this reason, it helps to maintain tissure homeostasis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An allergic response, or hypersensitivity, is an immune system overreaction.

There are four kinds of hypersensitivity:
*Immediate Hypersensitivity (Type I) - an immediate response to an allergen (a foreign substance that poses no danger in and of itself yet is treated as an antigen) that the immune system has had prior exposure to.
*Cytotoxic Hypersensitivity (Type II) - an immune response to human cells with foreign antigens.  Patients require blood type compatibility for transfusion because of the dangers of Type II hypersensitivity.
*Immune Complex Hypersensitivity (Type III) - an immune response to immune complexes (antigen-antibody complexes) that become stuck in a given area.  This results in continuous immune attack (and ensuing tissue damage).
*Delayed Hypersensitivity (Type IV) - an immune response to foreign substances that occurs over the course of several hours.  Poison Ivy's effects are the result of Type IV hypersensitivity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Autoimmune disease is a group of disorders in which the body's immune system improperly recognizes self-antigens (the body's own antigens - not foreign antigens) and induces an immune response that results in tissue destruction. Autoimmune disease can be either organ-specific (such as: Type I diabetes, Multiple sclerosis, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis etc.) or not organ-specific (Systemic lupus erythematosus, Rheumatoid arthritis, etc.).  Although autoimmune diseases are mediated through various mechanisms and can be induced by multiple environmental or hereditary causes, they all are a result of a failure in immunological tolerance. Immune cells that are improperly selected in the thymus (T-cells) and bone marrow (B-cells) can result in an expansion of these cells when they encounter self-antigens and cause disease. To safeguard against this, there is a type of regulatory T-cell (T-regs) that recognizes self-antigens and suppresses auto-reactive cells that are improperly selected. A failure in T-reg-mediated tolerance can result in autoimmunity without a defect in selection due to the molecular mimicry of foreign microbes. Although there is no known cure for any autoimmune disease, treatment with immunosuppressants (such as ciclosporin a and rapamycin) can be effective at managing symptoms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are three types of transplantation: autotransplantation (transplantation of self-tissue), allotransplantation (transplantation of non-self tissue from another non-identical individual of the same species), and xenotransplantation (transplantation of tissue from another species). With the exception of autotransplantation, all types of tissue transplants have a risk of undesired immune responses that result in the rejection of the transplanted tissue or disease. Both of these complications that can arise are a result of genetic incompatibility that is recognized by immune cells. Success of transplantation is dependent upon the similarity (histocompatibility) of the antigens of the donated tissue with that of self-antigens. Similarity at certain genetic sites (loci) are more important (major histocompatibility complex - MHC) than others (minor histocompatibility antigen MiHA) due to their broad expression on various types of tissue and their frequent interaction with immune cells.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Stem Cells==
The growth of stem cells in the bone marrow is the basis for cellular immunity.  In vitro mimicry of this growth can be achieved by filling a semisolid medium with stromal cells.  By adding different growth factors and cytokines, as well as stem cells of various differentiation level, the influence of chemical mediators of hematopoiesis can be understood.
HSCs can be taken from a donor and injected into a person who has a defective or absent hematopoietic system.  As little as 10% of the donor's bone marrow is removed and injected into the recipient, and the HSCs will find their way to the bone without direction, replenishing the hematopoietic system of the recipient.  
There are several types of stem cell grafts:
*autologous--donor is the recipient themself; the recipient can freeze HSCs prior to chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer; additionally, genetically engineered autologous HSCs can be injected back into the patient
*syngeneic--donor is genetically identical to recipient (identical twins)
*allogeneic--donor is genetically different from recipient
**this can lead to graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD)
**GVHD is based on MHC/HLA types, and so a bone marrow &quot;match&quot; occurs when an allogeneic member of the population is found to have relatively similar MHC/HLA types relative to the recipient

==Knock-Out Mice==
Genetic factors that produce certain cytokines (or certain cell types themselves) can be studied through the use of knock-out mice.  In these mice, a certain gene is inactivated and the animal is allowed to grow.  The resulting phenotype is compared against other knock-out mice, in an attempt to piece together the genetic basis of different cellular functions and phenotypes.  The process of gene knockout has become fine-tuned in recent years.  Basically, a gene library is searched for a candidate gene to be knocked-out.  A full mouse genome with the candidate gene knocked-out is developed and grown in a preliminary stem cell, and it is injected into a mouse stem cell via electroporation.  Besides making the candidate gene inoperable, the altered genome will usually have two factors:
*A gene to make the cultured preliminary stem cell resistant to a certain antibiotic.  Because not all of the stem cells will incorporate the altered genome, an antibiotic is applied to the treated cells, and only those that survive have therefore been injected with the altered genome (including both the antibiotic resistance gene and the knocked-out gene sequence)
*A gene to make the phenotype of a fully-altered knockout mouse obvious.  For example, the altered mouse genome might include a gene to make the knockout mice pure white in color.  The stem cells, before being treated, are collected from a black mouse.  Thus, when the black fur mother mouse is injected with the treated stem cells, she will give birth to baby mice with varied coat colors, from black to white and grey in between.  The nearly-white progeny are then cross-bred with each other, and the process is repeated until mice with pure white coats are created.  These mice are most likely to have both the pure white genotype and the knocked-out gene.  Thus, linked phenotypes are a marker for linked genotypes.  

Several genes effect hematopoiesis, and have been developed via gene knockout.  These include:
*'''GATA-2'''--regulates lymphoid and myeloid cell production, as well as RBC (erythrocyte) production
*'''Ikaros'''--regulates lymphoid cell production
*'''Oct-2'''--regulates differentiation of naive B cells into plasma cells

==Hematopoietic Stem Cell Concentration==
Irradiation of a mouse can wipe out the HSCs in the bone marrow, destroying the mouse's ability to produce red blood cells and leukocytes.  These cells can be replaced with the bone marrow cells of an immunologically identical mouse, although in the injected replacement cells very few cells are actually HSCs.  In order to concentrate the amount of actual HSCs in a sample, mice can be irradiated and replacement bone marrow cells are injected with fluorescent immunoglobulins that bind to mature RBCs and WBCs.  A flow cytometry method can now be used to weed out these labelled cells, and the process can be repeated until only those that are most likely undifferentiated remain.  The HSCs can be found in a subset of cells that contain the CD34 receptor on their surface; the CD34+ subpopulation is almost totally HSC with few differentiated cells.

==Monoclonal Antibodies==
A given antigen can have many epitopes, each one reacting with the immune system to create antibodies specific for each of the epitopes.  When a given antigen is given to an experiment animal, the animal will produce antigens for each of the epitopes of the antigen, forming a '''polyclonal antibody response'''.  Plasma B cells are then isolated from the animal's spleen, and these cells are fused with special cancerous (and therefore immortal) myeloma B cells, which do not generate any specific antibody themselves.  The myeloma cells lack a certain enzyme, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, or HGPRT, and therefore cannot grow under certain conditions (namely in the presence of HAT medium).  The product of these B cell/myeloma cell hybridizations are known as '''hybridomas''', and they secrete monoclonal antibody indefinitely.  After hybridization, there will be three types of cells: 1) spleen B cells, 2) myeloma cells, and 3) successfully formed hybridomas.  In order to select for the hybridomas, the mixture is grown on HAT medium (killing any unhybridized myeloma cells) and the spleen B cells (as they are not cancerous and will die of old age) are allowed to die.  Only those cells that can live a very long time (myeloma component) and contain HGPRT (plasma cell component) are able to survive the selection process.  This results only in hybridomas, each secreting a different antibody.  The mixture of polyclonal hybridomas are now separated via differential dilution in order to isolate the hybridomas for each specific epitopes, finally resulting in functional, immortal, monoclonal B cells.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are incredibly useful.  They can be radiolabelled or labelled with fluorescent molecules in order to detect proteins, such as cancer proteins in a tissue.  The use of fluorescent antibodies has also allowed scientists to image cellular components, increasing the understanding of the cell's structure as well as its genetics.  Additionally, the anticancer properties of '''immunotoxins''' result from a mAb bound to a certain toxin, which becomes localized to the cancer epitope that matches the mAb.  Antibodies can also be formed with enzymatic function ('''abzymes'''), which hold the promise of cleaving proteins at specific points in order to study proteomes more successfully.

==Affinity Chromatography==
A column of beads contains monoclonal antibodies.  A mixture of proteins (potential antigens) is then passed through the column, and the antigen in question binds with the monoclonal antibodies.  The column is then washed, removing any antigen that is not captured by the monoclonal antibodies.  The pH is then adjusted in order to break the Ab/Ag interactions, and the column is rinsed; the Ag in question will be eluted in this last wash.

==Radioimmunoassay (RIA)==
A radioimmunoassay is a scientific method used to test hormone levels in the blood without the need to use a bioassay. It involves mixing a radioactive antigen (frequently labelled with isotopes of iodine attached to tyrosine) with antibody to that antigen, then adding unlabeled or &quot;cold&quot; antigen in known quantities and measuring the amount of labeled antigen displaced.

Initially, the radioactive antigen is bound to the antibodies. When cold antigen is added, the two compete for antibody binding sites - and at higher concentrations of cold antigen, more binds to the antibody, displacing the radioactive variant. The bound antigens are separated from the unbound ones in solution and the radioactivity of each used to plot a binding curve.

Once this standard curve has been created, a sample can be taken from a patient.  The sample is then added to the Ab/radioactive Ag mixture.  The sample is allowed to mix with the radioactive Ag, and the unlabelled Ag (often a hormone being tested for in the body) will displace some of the radioactive Ag.  The mixture is then &quot;rinsed,&quot; and the amount of remaining radiolabelled antigen is compared with a standard curve, allowing an easy determination of unlabelled (patient-derived) Ag/hormone levels.

The technique is both extremely sensitive, and specific, if costly, and it is especially useful in diagnosing and treating autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

==Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA)==
A sample of antigen is applied to the surface of a well, and the spaces between the sample are filled with proteins that do not bind antibody.  A large amount of antibody, linked to a certain enzyme that can create a color change, is added to the sample under conditions that allow only Ab/Ag binding; ''there must be enough Ab added to react with every possible Ag molecule in the sample--if you have more Ag than Ab, the extra Ag will '''not''' be detected by the test''.  The well is then washed, and the color-changing reaction is activated.  The level of color change can be measured by spectrometry, and the concentration of antigen can be determined via comparison of color change with a standard curve.
*'''Sandwich (capture) ELISA'''--for Antigens of very low concentration, such as cytokines, binding to the well plate can be difficult.  This method uses an Ab specific for one of the epitopes on the Ag, attaching these bottom antibodies to the plate well, where they bind the added small concentration of Ag.  A second type of antibody, one that binds to a different epitope on the Ag, is added to the well. Thus, the Ag is sandwiched between a bottom &quot;holding&quot; antibody and an upper, &quot;detector&quot; antibody that is linked to a color-changing enzyme.

==Competitive Inhibition Assay==
Similar to the RIA, in this test a fixed amount of Ab is attached to the surface of a well.  A known amount of radiolabelled Ag is added to the well, and the sample (ostensibly containing unlabelled Ag) is also added to the well.  There must be enough labelled Ag added to react with every Ab, otherwise the test will not be accurate.  This is because the unlabelled Ag must compete with the labelled Ag, and to truly compete every Ab binding site must be potentially filled with the labelled Ag.  The well are rinsed, and the amount of unlabelled Ag that &quot;out-competed&quot; the labelled Ag is compared to a standard curve (thus, the amount of remaining labelled Ag is inversely proportional, via some relationship in the std curve, to the amount of Ag in the sample.

==Blood Typing==
The fact that each antibody has at least two (and, in the case of dimers and pentamers, more than two) identical binding sites for an epitope allows agglutination of antigens.  Hemagglutination is the use of this property to test for blood types; anti-A Ab anti-B Ab, and a mixture of anti-A and anti-B Ab are added to aliquots of a blood sample, and the clumping (agglutination) indicates the blood type.  

==Coombs Test==
The Coombs Test (also Coombs' Test) is a blood test used to determine whether there are red blood cell antibodies, which leads usually to hemolysis, especially in Rh disease. Coombs antibody is an anti-human globulin. It was first described in 1945 by Cambridge immunologists Robin Coombs, Arthur Mourant and Rob Race. The test is also used in screening blood prior to blood transfusion.

Two types of the test exist:

* Indirect Coombs test - also known as the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT). This is used in the matching of blood products. It detects immunoproteins present on red blood cell membranes, by adding a polyspecific antiserum which contains antibodies specific for human immunoglobulins and complement to agglutinate the cells.
* Direct Coombs test - also known as the direct antiglobulin test (DAT). It detects antibodies capable of attaching to normal red blood cells, by incubating normal red blood cells in the serum, washing the cells, and then using a polyspecific antiserum which contains antibodies specific for human immunoglobulins and complement to agglutinate the cells. The DAT is used to determine if the patient has immune-mediated hemolysis (antibody-mediated destruction of red blood cells), as occurs in Rh disease.

The Coombs Test is used to detect the presence of agglutinated red blood cells in a patient's blood. If positive, the interpretation is that an antigen-antibody reaction has taken place in vivo. The Coombs test is sometimes referred to as the Direct Antiglobulin Test. The indirect antiglobulin test is also called an antibody screen. In this test, a few drops of patient serum is placed in a small test tube with a drop of reagent red blood cells and checked to see if there is an antigen-antibody reaction. If there is such a reaction, it means the patient's serum contains antibodies to the known antigen on the reagent red blood cells.

Hi, BAW.  Welcome to Wikibooks!  I figure that you're the same BAW as on Wikipedia.  Thanks for your help on the [[Radiation Oncology]] wikibook.  If you have any questions about the project, please feel free to leave a comment on my talk page or send me an e-mail.  [[User:Brim|Brim]] 09:00, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called BAW. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name BAW~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Understanding the essence of People and their interactions....==

We as people interact on a physical basis on many levels, firstly through our body language, secondly through our tone of voice and finally through the content of our words spoken, surprisingly this last level offers the least amount of information to the other person in the communication process whom is receiving the message. This is because when people communicate they are expressing not only through their mental conscious thoughts but are also being influenced by their sub conscious mind, consequently communicating other messages to the receiver in the form of body language. As a result of this, the perceptive receiver may hear the words being spoken by the communicator but may also get an understanding of the feelings behind the messages, these messages may contradict the message from the words, consequently adding more understanding to the interactions. For example, a person may say to you &quot;I feel comfortable around you&quot; and at the same time may be crossing his/her arms possibly showing the defensive body posture. The receiver in this situation, if aware of these messages, would obviously have to consider the sincerity of the other's words. Finally, careful listening needs to be exercised when listening to the words, as the way that words are expressed can add many different messages. For example, &quot;Hi.&quot; in a low-toned, brief manner could indicate that the communicator is feeling tired or down, whereas a longer, higher-toned &quot;Hi!&quot; could mean happiness or happy to see you.

Therefore, to ensure a full understanding of how each interaction between yourself and any fellow person in this world is achieved, as long as you both speak the same language of course, you need to actively pay attention and consider the three essential levels. It must also be noted that there are other factors which affect a person's ability to understand all of these messages. Firstly, our perception--how each individual see things in this world--can limit understanding. Perception is developed through a person's lifetime through their life experiences; one is more likely to perceive an event based on what they have experienced in the past, making a connection in understanding from what they have already understood/experienced about the event. This can have limiting effects on one's ability to understand, as a person can get the feeling of confidence that they fully understand the situation when in fact they may miss important messages being communicated through their interactions. An example of this would be early judgements on the communicator's behaviour and motives.

==About Me==

I was born in Belgium to a German mother and Turkish father, but we moved to the UK three months later, meaning I’m quite Anglicized. My life is focused around several interests, especially [[martial arts]] and [[poetry]], the latter also being my area of academic study for the past six years or so. The other major focus is of course my girlfriend, who I live with for half the week. 

I'm a keen martial artist, and have experience in various styles. However, my main training is in [[Zhuan Shu Kuan]] and [[Brazilian jiu jitsu]]. Some of my other interests are  [[music]], [[film]], [[history]] and [[travel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some notable aspects of Toyama dialect:

# Pauses in sentences are often accompanied by a pitch vibration.
#* あのねぇ ''ano nee''
#* それで ''sore de''
#* そこへ行って ''soko e itte''
#*: In each of these examples, the pitch goes up-down-up-down, or even up-down-up-down-up-down. Pitch intervals can be as much as as 5-8 whole steps.
# の ''no'' is replaced by が ''ga'' (except in the possessive).
#* そうなの？ ''sou na no?'' becomes そうなが？ ''sou na ga?''
#* できないので ''dekinai no de'' becomes できないがで ''dekinai ga de''
# か ''ka'' as a question marker is replaced by っけ ''kke''
#* 分かるか ''wakaru ka'' becomes 分かるっけ ''wakaru kke''
# いる ''iru'' becomes おる ''oru'' or おん
#* ここにいる ''koko ni iru'' becomes ここにおる ''koko ni oru'' or ここにおん ''koko ni on''
# てる ''-te ru'' (contraction of ている ''-te iru'') becomes とる ''-toru'' or とん ''-ton''
#* 分かってる ''wakatteru'' becomes 分かっとる ''wakattoru'' or 分かっとん ''wakatton''
# ない ''-nai'' becomes ''-ん''
#* できない ''dekinai'' becomes できん ''dekin''
#* 分からない ''wakaranai'' becomes 分からん ''wakaran''
#* だれもいない ''dare mo inai'' becomes だれもおらん ''dare mo oran''

Putting everything together, you can get the very comical phrase:
* トンガ行っとんが知っとんが? ''Tonga itton ga shitton ga?''
*: meaning トンガに行っているのを知っているの ''Tonga itte iru no o shitte iru no?'' or &quot;Did you know he went to Tonga?&quot;

Print can lay claim to being the first mass medium. 20% of Americans don't (or can't) read. The average American reads .8 books a year.

It is traditionally been suggested that it first made an impact with the invention of Gutenberg's system of movable type in 1452. However, the earliest example of a printed book is the Diamond Sutra printed using movable clay type in China in 868CE. Though this is the earliest available example, it is thought this system was already well established when the Diamond Sutra was published. Gutenberg's innovation, made apparently without knowledge of the Chinese system, was to cast individual letter forms from metal.

Ratings are used to get statistics on popularity of programming. The ratings system used for TV is Nielsen, and the system for radio is Arbitron.

Any of various drugs that inhibit, enhance, or mimic the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, the primary transmitter of nerve impulses within the parasympathetic nervous system—i.e., that part of the autonomic nervous system that contracts smooth muscles, dilates blood vessels, increases bodily secretions, and slows the heart rate. Some cholinergic drugs, such as muscarine, pilocarpine, and arecoline, mimic the activity of acetylcholine in stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system. These drugs have few therapeutic uses, though one of them, nicotine, is the principal addictive ingredient in the tobacco used in cigarettes and cigars. Other cholinergic drugs, such as atropine and scopolamine, inhibit the action of acetylcholine and thus suppress all the actions of the parasympathetic nervous system. They are used therapeutically to diminish salivation and bronchial secretions during anesthesia and to dilate the pupil during ophthalmological procedures. Scopolamine is also used to treat motion sickness, an effect that depends on its ability to depress the activity of the central nervous system.

I removed the following content from this module. I was not sure how reliable it was to spot these types of persons, or if these tips were useful. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:23, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 2px black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Advice by Type&lt;/big&gt;

* By profession... 
# '''Academics''' 
## The Spotter's Guide: hunched posture, long pauses, social awkwardness, lack of attention to dress, long working hours, absent-mindedness.
## Associated Boons: fascinating, if exoteric, conversation, healthy income, long holidays, keep fascinating company, easily pleased.
## Dating: speak quietly; swat up on their field of study; think cultured, not expensive; aim at simple beauty, not gauwdy showiness.
# '''Nerds'''
## The Spotter's Guide: introversion, caustic humour, questionable personal hygene, general amiableness, long hair, thick-lensed glasses, nocturnal hours.
## Associated Boons: often remarkable intelligence, knowlegeable, technically useful, abundant leisure time, lack of competition.
## Dating: think ultra-modern; low lighting; be a little late; keep it brief; say you'd like to e-mail sometime.

* By location... 
# '''City slickers'''
# '''Suburb Slobs'''
# '''Country Bumpkins'''


* By steadiness... 
# '''Rocky the Reliable'''
# '''The Provider'''
# '''Listless Youth'''
# '''The Rebel without a Cause'''
# '''The Rollercoaster'''

&lt;big&gt;The Phase&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;The Moment&lt;/big&gt;

'Timing, timing, timing' is the dating equivalent of 'location, location, location'. With all other factors being perfectly equal, sometimes the match will come together beautifully and at other times it won't. How therefore do you know when the time is right?

* '''The Foul Weather Friend.''' Be around for him when he's just been rejected for all 150 jobs that he's just applied for or embarrassed himself in public.

{{Programming/Navigation|lang=Java|previous=Unchecked Exceptions|next=Stack trace}}
{{Java Programming/ExceptionsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

&lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/code&gt;. In Java, a special {{java:null}} can be assigned to an object reference.
&lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; is thrown when an application attempts to use an object reference, having the {{java:null}} value.
These include:
* Calling an instance method on the object referred by a null reference.
* Accessing or modifying an instance field of the object referred by a null reference.
* If the reference type is an array type, taking the length of a null reference.
* If the reference type is an array type, accessing or modifying the slots of a null reference.
* If the reference type is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;Throwable&lt;/code&gt;, throwing a null reference.
Applications should throw instances of this class to indicate other illegal uses of the null object.
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-13&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.13: Null pointer.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
Object obj = null;
obj.toString();  // This statement will throw a NullPointerException
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
The above code shows one of the pitfall of Java, and the most common source of bugs. No object is created and the compiler does not detect it. &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; is one of the most common exceptions thrown in Java.

== Why do we need &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;? ==
The reason we need it is because many times, we need to create an object reference before the object itself is created. Object references cannot exist without a value, so we assign the [[Java_Programming/Literals#null|&lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;]] value to it.
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-14&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.14: Non-instantiated declared object.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
public Person getPerson(boolean isWoman) {
  Person person = null;
  if (isWoman) {
    person = createWoman();
  } else {
    person = createMan();
  }
  return person;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
In the [[#code-section-14|code section 6.14]] we want to create the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; inside the if-else, but we also want to return the object reference to the caller, so we need to create the object reference outside of the if-else, because of the [[Java Programming/Scope|scoping rule]] in Java. Incorrect error-handling and poor contract design can be a pitfall with any programming language. This is also true for Java.

Now we will describe how to prevent &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;. It does not describe general techniques for how you should program Java.  It is of some use, to make you more aware of null values, and to be more careful about generating them yourself.

This list is not complete &amp;mdash; there are no rules for preventing &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; entirely in Java, because the standard libraries have to be used, and they can cause &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;s.  Also, it is possible to observe an uninitialized final field in Java, so you can't even treat a final field as being completely trusted during the object's creation.

A good approach is to learn how to deal with &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;s first, and become competent with that.  These suggestions will help you to cause less &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;s, but they don't replace the need to know about &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;s.

== Comparing string variable with a string literal ==
When you compare a variable with a string literal, most of people would do that this way:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-15&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.15: Bad comparison.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
if (state.equals(&quot;OK&quot;)) {
  ...
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

Always put the string literal first:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-16&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.16: Better comparison.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
if (&quot;OK&quot;.equals(state)) {
  ...
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

If the &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; variable is null, you get a &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; in the first example, but not in the second one.

== Minimize the use of the keyword 'null' in assignment statements==

This means not doing things like:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-17&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.17: Declaring an exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
String s = null;
while (something) {
    if (something2) {
        s = &quot;yep&quot;;
    }
}

if (s != null) {
    something3(s);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

You can replace this with:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-18&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.18: Declaring an exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
boolean done = false;

while (!done &amp;&amp; something) {
    if (something2) {
       done = true;
       something3(&quot;yep&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

You might also consider replacing null with &quot;&quot; in the first example, but default values bring about bugs caused by default values being left in place.  A &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt; is actually better, as it allows the runtime to tell you about the bug, rather than just continue with a default value.

==Minimize the use of the new Type[int] syntax for creating arrays of objects==

An array created using &lt;code&gt;new Object[10]&lt;/code&gt; has 10 null pointers.  That's 10 more than we want, so use collections instead, or explicitly fill the array at initialization with:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-19&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.19: Declaring an exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Object[] objects = {&quot;blah&quot;, 5, new File(&quot;/usr/bin&quot;)};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

or:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-20&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.20: Declaring an exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Object[] objects;
objects = new Object[]{&quot;blah&quot;, 5, new File(&quot;/usr/bin&quot;)};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

==Check all references obtained from 'untrusted' methods==

Many methods that can return a reference can return a null reference.  Make sure you check these.  For example:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-21&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.21: Declaring an exception.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
File file = new File(&quot;/etc&quot;);
File[] files = file.listFiles();
if (files != null) {
    stuff
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

&lt;code&gt;File.listFiles()&lt;/code&gt; can return null if &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; is not a directory.

You can decide to trust some methods not to return null, if you like, but that's an assumption you're making.  Some methods that don't specify that they might return null, actually do, instead of throwing an exception.

== For each loop trap ==

Beware if you loop on an array or a collection in a for each loop.

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-22&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.22: Visit a collection.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
Collection&lt;Integer&gt; myNumbers = buildNumbers();
for (Integer myNumber : myNumbers) {
  System.out.println(myNumber);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

If the object is null, it does not just do zero loops, it throws a null pointer exception. So don't forget this case. Add an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement or return empty collections:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-23&quot;&gt;'''Code section 6.23: Visit a collection safety.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2, 6&quot;&gt;
Collection&lt;Integer&gt; myNumbers = buildNumbers();
if (myNumbers != null) {
  for (Integer myNumber : myNumbers) {
    System.out.println(myNumber);
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== External tools ==
There is tools like FindBugs that parse your code and warn you about potential bugs. Most of the time, it detects possible null pointers.

Although #1 Person is a pretty smart person, he should not be considered an expert in most topics, and anyone with formal education most likely is correct.

However #1 Person has studied Biotechology at Roger Williams University.

Also #1 Person has a backround in advanced geographical studies, engineering and Arabic/Islamic history.

==Other Languages==

N1 person has a advanced understanding of the English language, as well as a working understanding of Latin and Arabic. However he should not be considered an expert (as in don't always accept him in grammar and the like) in the latter two.

The '''Russian Wikibook''' is designed to present lesson material through intellectually conducive methods. The lessons are designed to give maximum immersion, and will only provide Cyrillic text. It might be frustrating initially, but learning the [[Russian/Alphabet|alphabet]] quickly is the first step to facilitating quicker progress. 

[[Image:Yaroslavl Elias Cathedral 001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Церковь Ильи-пророка, Elijiah Church]]
The lessons aim to provide the student with a good knowledge of reading and writing. As with any language, to learn Russian it is best to find a language partner: a native speaker who is patient and willing to help correct your mistakes. A book can only take even the most self-motivated student so far. This book is highly integrated with Wiktionary and Wikipedia, giving a stronger foundation in vocabulary and culture. It is highly suggested to read the Wikipedia articles about [[w:Russia|Russia]], [[w:Russian language|Russian language]], and [[w:Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]].

=Subjunctive Passive Verbs=

==Subjunctive Passive Perfect==
Subjunctive passive verbs form from the 4th principle part as shown in the example below.

The verb's third principle part, e.g. in the word impedire(to obstruct): impedio, impedire, '''impedivi''',  impeditus; gains the passive ending for the appropriate person. 


This is an example of the Subjunctive Passive in the perfect tense.
muto, mutare, mutavi, mutatum -- to change

To make the verb into a perfect passive, take the fourth principle part, make it agree with the subject in gender, number, and case, and then add in the appropriate form of esse. In the perfect, we use the present form of esse, and specifically the subjunctive present(sim, sis, sit, simus, sitis, sint.)

For example, Do you know ''what has been done to him?'' would be made into: scis quid eum factum sit?

             ''Singular''

            mutatus sim      '''I have been changed.'''
            mutatus sis      '''You have been changed.'''
            mutatus sit      '''He has been changed.'''

              ''Plural*''

            mutati simus     '''We have been changed.'''
            mutati sitis     '''You have been changed.'''
            mutati sint      '''They have been changed.'''


*Note well that in the plural, the word &quot;mutatus&quot; becomes &quot;mutati,&quot; thus taking on the plural nominitive. Remember that the perfect passive verbs require the fourth participle to agree in gender and number!


===Exercises===

'''In this section, it is only truly necessary to translate the italicized portion. The rest exists in order to make the subjunctive necessary.'''

the children were so bad that they ''have been scolded.'' (Children- Liberi; To scold- vitupero, vituperare, vituperavi)



He asked how ''I was tricked.''(trick-ludo, ludere, lusi, lusus)


My parents drove to town so that now ''I have been born in a hospital.''(born- cresco, crescere, crevi, cretus; Hospital- valetudinarium, valetudinarii-n.)



==Subjunctive Passive Pluperfect==

The subjunctive passive pluperfect is very similar to the perfect, with the major difference being the way esse is conjugated. In specific, the word esse is simply given the active endings(m,s,t,mus,tis, nt)




mutavi + '''isse''' --&gt; 
                       ''Singular''

            mutatus essem    '''I had been changed.'''
            mutatus esses    '''You had been changed.'''
            mutatus esset    '''He had been changed.'''

              ''Plural*''

            mutati essemus   '''We had been changed.'''
            mutati essetis   '''You had been changed.'''
            mutati essent    '''They had been changed.'''

[[Category:Latin]]

===Exercises===

In these exercises, only the italicized parts require translation. The rest exist to make the subjunctive necessary. Remember, the subjunctive is not used in any but complex sentences or other rare circumstances.

Ovid wrote so much in the Metamorphoses that ''his hand had been changed into stone.''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Out of the many centuries of political economics, it was only in the 20th century that there was a focus on money as capital. Whereas previous capitalist models focused on the means of production and the production of commodities, it was not until the 20th century that capital itself and the investment of capital in the money market began being a huge issue. The section on money is not really appropraite for this module on political economy since political economy is focused on the philosophy rather than mechanics of the flow of resources. This conception of money only works assuming a few basic things: free markets, the liberal idea that economics is not a zero-sum game, and that money can be freely distributed and invested. There have been many times in history when not all of these assumptions have been met. For example, in the feudal times, money was not used very extensively and barter was used instead. Also, it does not cover mercantilist conceptions of money in the 1600s. This article is about the development of modern assumptions that are used in the studies of politics and economics today. What you take for fact in those studies are only conclusions reached by the philosophers of political economy. In other words, what you take for granted are only a few theories out of many, because these theories are used as baseline assumptions for figuring the mechanics out of those two studies which have branched from this one.

[[File:Indonesian kue lapis legit - 20130217.jpg|thumb|A ''kue lapis legit'' with an intricate design from Indonesia]]

'''Lapis legit''' (Dutch: ''spekkoek'') is a spice-flavored multilayered cake. A legacy of Dutch occupation in Indonesia, the cake is enjoyed during Eid ul-Fitr and Christmas celebrations. In the Netherlands, the sliced cake is served as dessert in ''Rijsttafel'' (Indonesian rice table).

The cake has a firm texture similar to [[Cookbook:Baumkuchen|baumkuchen]], but without a chocolate or sugar shell. The cake requires much patience to bake. Each layer of the cake is made by pouring a small amount of batter from a cup into the baking tin, then putting the tin into the oven until the layer has become golden from the heat. The tin is then removed from the oven and the process is repeated until all the layers have been built up. Baking the cake in a gas oven gives a better aroma than using an electric oven, but a Dutch oven with a charcoal fire on top of the lid produces the best result.

If clove buds or cardamom seeds are difficult to find, use spekkoek powder as a replacement. Milling and mixing the spices before baking produces a cake with an excellent aroma. 

==Ingredients==
* 10 large yolks
* 4 eggs whites
* 125 gr [[Cookbook:Castor sugar|castor sugar]]
* 195 gr sweetened [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|condensed milk]]
* 500 gr [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 125 gr cake [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 10 [[Cookbook:Clove|clove]] buds, milled
* 10 [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] seeds, milled
* 2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]] mace powder
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] powder
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] powder

==Procedure==
# Mix and sift spice ingredients.
# Beat butter until smooth and creamy.
# Beat egg yolks with castor sugar until fluffy.
# Beat egg whites in separate mixing bowl until fluffy, then mix with egg yolks.
# Mix the spices, condensed milk, flour, and butter.
# Grease a baking pan.
# Using a small cup, pour 30-35 cc batter into baking pan to make a layer.
# Bake in preheated 350°F oven, heat from top, until golden (4-5 minutes).
# Remove from oven, paint butter for flavoring, and pour 30-35 cc batter to make another layer.
# Repeat to make around 30-40 layers.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==
* Adding to the complexity of the baking process, some cake shops add dried [[Cookbook:Plum|plums]] (prunes) inside and on top of the cake.

==Introduction==
The classical branch studies range from the conservative philosophers such as Machiavelli to liberals such as Adam Smith or  critics of liberalism such as Marx.

==Before The Enlightenment==

===Hammurabi===

===Machiavelli===
[[Image:Santi_di_Tito_-_Niccolo_Machiavelli's_portrait_headcrop.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Detail of the portrait of Machiavelli, ca 1500, in the robes of a Florentine public official.]]

===Hobbes===

==Liberalism==

===Locke===

===Rousseau===
A French philosopher and writer born in Switzerland, he believed that the natural goodness of man was warped by society, most of his ideas were influenced by the French Revolution.

===Smith===
[[Image:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Adam Smith]]

===Bentham===

===Liberalism===
Classical liberalism came from the philosophy of the Enlightenment of the 18th century. Liberals generally believe that individuals are virtuous people who can more or less govern themselves by a mixture of this virtue and by rationality (which also draws from the Enlightenment idea that there is a definite Truth in the world, and that Truth may be found by actively searching for it and by applying logic to facts). Since liberals believe that individuals are naturally virtuous, they can and should be able to govern themselves and to decide the paths of their own lives with as little government intervention as possible. Liberals are not anarchists because they do recognize that a state is important in order to control the people as a whole, but they do believe that the state which governs least is the one which governs best.

==Alternatives To Liberalism==

===Malthus===

===Veblen===

===List===

===Hegel===

===Marx===
And finally, the division of labor offers us the first example of how, as long as man remains in natural society, that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interest, as long, therefore, as activity is not voluntarily, but naturally, divided, man’s own deed becomes an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him. For as soon as the distribution of labor comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic. (The German Ideology)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Modern Political Economics'''

==Introduction==
The economy is the realized social system of production, exchange, distribution, and consumption of goods and services of a country or other area. Today the range of fields of study exploring, registering and describing the economy or part of it. Practical fields directly related to the human activities involving production, distrubution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services as a whole. Sumer developed a large scale economy based on money, while the Babylonians and their neighboring city states later developed the earliest system of economics as we think,in term of rules/laws on dept. The ancient economy was mainly based on subsistence farming.

==Assumptions==
===Introduction===

Modern economies generally produce a large (by historical standards) economic surplus. This surplus is composed of a vast number of goods in addition to those associated with the basic physiological needs of food, shelter, etc. 

However, in the modern world, the majority of human beings live in large-scale, organised societies, called states. The government of a state claims a ''de jure'', and often possesses ''de facto'', monopoly of legitimate force within its borders. This control of the monopoly of force allows a government to re-allocate, through law, portions of the economic surplus between private individuals. This study of political power as it effects distribution and production of goods in an economy, creates the field of political economy.

To varying degrees, ranging from the very slight to the very extensive, all modern and pre-modern states in the world redistirbute economic goods within their borders. The manner, extent and moral legitimacy of such redistribution is the source for much political debate and disagreement. 

Hence government is a lucrative source of income (or ''economic rents'' ) for any group that can control or influence it. Competition between organised social groups for control of government has therefor been a source of conflict throughout history. This competition continues to express itself in everything from peaceful democratic elections to civil war. Modern political economists are often concerned with the problem of how to form a stable power bloc sufficient to gain and hold control of government.

===Modern Capitalist Conception Of Money===
'''Money''' is only a means of exchange. It is quite possible to have communities use barter instead, such as &quot;I give you a cow for (whatever)&quot;. In a society that uses money care should be taken, if at all possible (unfortunately very often it is NOT possible), to ensure that the total of the spending of money per year is always less than the total income per year of the individual, or community, concerned.

Money loses its value continually; this is called [[Macroeconomics/Inflation|inflation]], because prices increase as the value of the currency decreases. This could be thought of as being a tax on all savings and also at the same time as a reduction of all debts.

Many people borrow money and later repay that amount - unfortunately borrowing can be very expensive, because interest usually has to be paid in addition to the amount borrowed (called &quot;The Principal&quot;). Sometimes the economic conditions are so very bad that no repayment of the principal is possible for a very long time, if at all; even to get enough money for paying the interest on the debt may be quite difficult. If interest is not paid at the time it is due, then the loan is said to be &quot;in default&quot;, and considerable trouble can be the result.

===Classical Liberalism===
====&quot;Right&quot; Wing====
====Libertarianism====
===Social Liberalism===
*The economy of a country is closely connected to the well-being, or otherwise, of the people living there, and politics can influence considerably the economy of that country. In general the income of individuals is related to their education, and the jobs available at the time may require a particular set of skills. Poverty results from inability of individuals to have income larger than the actual expenditures.
*Governments can have large expenditures, possibly larger than the revenue obtained via taxation; then there is a deficit, requiring the borrowing of money and the consequent payment of interest on the amount borrowed. That interest payment could have been prevented if the revenue obtained from taxes would have been higher.
*One group of politicians may want to supply a lot of expensive services to people for free or at low cost, while other politicians may want to minimize the amount of taxes that have to be paid, and they may even promise tax cuts. In democratic countries the number of votes obtained by candidates for parliamentary/congressional seats depends considerably on election promises, and these, if implemented by the government, may considerably influence the economic health of the country, and of its individuals, eventually.

==Weber==
===Elite Theory===
Elite Theory is based on the idea that a society is always divided into two groups i.e. the minority elite and the ruled.Elite Theory is a direct contradiction to the Marxist Ideology.

==Domestic Policy==
==International Policy==
==Development==
The area of development is a diverse field with many political orientations, Marxist, Neoliberal and Postmodernist being among them.  It covers the reasons behind the historical growth of Less Developed Countries (LDC), sometimes called the Third World.  Political economy of development embraces an interdisciplinary approach that includes many social sciences.  Much of the research into this area is focused on the growth of what are now developed countries, like Taiwan, Korea and Japan.  The debate is how these countries became rich, what political and economic factors caused these places to change so much.  

Another strand of research is in the failure of countries to change, such as India's post independence state failure in Industrialisation.  Other debates include whether democracy or inequality causes or constrains growth and sustainable development.

Typically political economists view the world as heterogenous, that is there are no universal laws to explain development.  Instead they focus in on an area in the world and even individual countries and sub-nation-state units which allow them to come to conclusions on questions. 
{{Political Economy/stub}}

== Khan's Patron Client Model of Development ==
Khan applied the patron client model to development in many developing countries.  Essentially the state is given as a patron, and it has many clients who are capitalists.  These capitalists bribe the state and in exchange get subsidies and other benefits forming a patron-client relationship.  Other clients in the nation-state are the middle class, who engage in political activism to obtain benefits.  

This model is applied to different developing countries, so Korea, which did not have any middle class had high growth due to the capitalist clients getting most of the money from the government to invest and market their products.  On the other hand India had a large middle class which meant that its industrialisation programme was hindered by middle class competition for resources from the state.

Firefox 1.5 and Opera 8.5 shows 105 and 108 instead if 2005 and 2008 for the code:

  var mydate = new Date();
  document.write(mydate.getYear());
  document.write(&quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&quot;);
  mydate.setYear(2008);
  document.write(mydate.getYear());

That's why we should always use getFullYear() instead of getYear(), as recommended by

I don't find interjections like &quot;That wasn't very hard, was it?&quot; or &quot;Don't let Bill Gates know -- he'll patent it!&quot; to be helpful. To me they seem silly and childish -- but then I don't like the &quot;Dummies&quot; books either. What do other people think?

: &lt;blockquote&gt;Now that wasn't very hard, was it? At this point, we are only using functions to save us some typing (actually, in the examples we used it is actually taking more typing - however, real-world programs will use the same function throughout the scripts.) When you learn about parameters, that's when functions really start to shine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Classes section had the following at the start of some code:
 var site = new Object(); //Required to not cause error in Internet Explorer
 site = {};

As the error hasn't been able to be duplicated from IE3 to IE7, more details about the error need to be provided. The code now starts with

==Bad code!!==
The code in the section '''this keyword''' is discouraged according to the link under '''Further reading''', because it creates methods as objects for ''totalValue'', ''addQuarters'' and ''addDollars'' again and again for each object. The link provided instead explains another coding style that makes any OOPL programmer cry in despair! One has to create a &quot;parent&quot; type and then assign a predefined ''prototype'' property with that &quot;parent&quot; type. D*rn!!

:Well, there is help for the OOPL programmer: to switch from an object-''based'' language to an object-''oriented'' one! :-&gt;--[[User:Sae1962|Sae1962]] ([[User talk:Sae1962|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sae1962|contribs]]) 13:46, 18 March 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">From the equation for velocity, and the two equations for acceleration, you can derive '''the equations of motion'''. These equations can be used to solve problems that seem very complicated at first. The equations are:

* &lt;math&gt; \vec v_f = \vec v_i + \vec a t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; v_f^2= v_i^2+ 2 \vec a . \vec s&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \vec s = \vec v_i t+{\frac {1}{2}} \vec a t^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; |s| = \frac {( |v_i|+ |v_f|)}{2} \times t&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\vec a&lt;/math&gt; is acceleration, &lt;math&gt; \vec s&lt;/math&gt; is displacement, which can also be written as &lt;math&gt; \vec x_f - \vec x_i &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \vec x_i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec x_f &lt;/math&gt; being the initial and final position vectors of the body respectively,  &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time, &lt;math&gt;\vec v_i&lt;/math&gt; is initial velocity and &lt;math&gt; \vec v_f&lt;/math&gt; is final velocity. Note that these equations only work when an object is moving in a straight line and has constant acceleration.

Note that in the 3rd equation the '''dot product''' of the two vectors &lt;math&gt; \vec a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \vec b &lt;/math&gt; is taken. The 4th equation gives the '''distance''' covered not the displacement. As a result, it's usage is not preferred.

The derivation of the above formulae, uses the basic definitions of velocity and acceleration, with the help of calculus.

By definiton,

 # &lt;math&gt;\  \vec v = d\vec x / dt &lt;/math&gt;
 # &lt;math&gt;\  \vec a=d\vec v/dt    &lt;/math&gt;
 # &lt;math&gt;\ \vec v d \vec v / d \vec x = \vec a &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \vec x &lt;/math&gt; is position vector (from an axis), &lt;math&gt; \vec v &lt;/math&gt; is velocity, and &lt;math&gt; \vec a &lt;/math&gt; is accleration

Assuming &lt;math&gt; \vec a &lt;/math&gt; to be constant, since the above formulae are defined under that condition only,

== V-T Relation ==

&lt;math&gt;\ \vec a dt = d\vec v &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \int_{0}^{t} \vec a\, dt = \int_{v_i}^{v_f}  d \vec v &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ \vec at = \vec v_f - \vec v_i &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\ \vec v_f = \vec v_i + \vec a t &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \vec v_f &lt;/math&gt; is final velocity, and &lt;math&gt; \vec v_i &lt;/math&gt; is initial velocity.

== X - T Relation ==

&lt;math&gt;\ d \vec x / d \vec t = /vec v &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ d \vec x =  \vec v dt &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ d \vec x = (\vec v_i + \vec a t )dt &lt;/math&gt;


The last step was got by substituting the result from the previous derivation. Intergrating,



&lt;math&gt;  \int_{x_i}^{x_f} dx =  \int_{0}^{t} (\vec v_i + \vec a t ), dt &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;  \vec x_f - \vec x_f = \vec v_i t + 1/2 \vec a t &lt;/math&gt;


== V-X Relation ==


&lt;math&gt;\ \vec v d \vec v / d \vec x = \vec a &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ \vec v d \vec v = \vec a d \vec x &lt;/math&gt;

Intergrating

&lt;math&gt;\ \int_{v_i}^{v_f} \vec v, d \vec v = \int_{x_i}^{x_f} \vec a, d \vec x &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ 1/2(v_f ^2 - v_i ^2) = \vec a . (x_f - x_i) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ v_f ^2 = v_i ^ 2 + 2 \vec a . (x_f - x_i) &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt; x_f - x_i &lt;/math&gt; is nothing but the '''displacement''' of the body, and is substituted by the term &lt;math&gt; \vec s &lt;/math&gt;. So the final formula is,

&lt;math&gt;\ v_f ^2 - v_i ^2 = 2 \vec a . \vec s &lt;/math&gt;

One very important thing that must be noted here is that the terms &lt;math&gt; v_f ^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v_i ^2 &lt;/math&gt; are ''' not ''' the vector quantities, but the magnitude of the vector whole squared. Technically, it is: &lt;math&gt; v_f ^2 = \vec v_f . \vec v_f &lt;/math&gt; , i.e the dot product. Another thing to note is that the term &lt;math&gt; 2 \vec a . \vec s &lt;/math&gt; is again the dot product of the acceleration and the displacement.</text>

All the leaders face clockwise, and all the followers face anti-clockwise, one
between each leader.

The leader takes the follower's right hand in his left, and does a mambo step,
but reversed.  The left foot goes back and the right goes forward, but not very
far, as the follower will be in the way.  The leader's right hand meets the
follower's left at the same time as the right foot goes forward.  They push
against each other, and let go with the leader's right, follower's left.  The
leader's left keeps hold of the follower's right.

Meanwhile, the follower does normal mambo steps, except that the step forward is
smaller, as the leader would be in the way of a bigger step.

== Overview ==

'''''Episkey''''' is a healing charm that works well on broken bones. We see it used on facial injuries, but it may have other uses as well.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We first see this spell when it is used by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s nose in the Hogwarts Express at the start of the sixth year. Harry later uses it to cure [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Demelza Robins|Demelza]]'s mouth on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] pitch in that same year.

== Analysis ==

Used as it is, this is clearly a healing spell, but we cannot be entirely certain as to its function. When Tonks uses it on Harry, it works to mend his nose which had just been broken by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]]. Demelza's injury, caused by a thrown Quaffle, is not likely as severe, so probably does not include any broken bones, which implies more of a general healing spell rather than something specific to bones.

We must wonder somewhat about the necessity of visiting the Hospital Wing in cases of broken bones, if the spell to mend them is simple enough to be used by a sixth-year [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]] student. (Our assumption is that this is a Charm, as the nature of the thing acted on does not change; it is still, for example, a nose, just one that is no longer broken.) We cannot argue the need for the Hospital Wing, as magical injuries so often seem to be more severe than a simple broken bone, but there should have been no need for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] to go to the Hospital Wing for his broken wrist after [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 9|he fell off his broomstick]]. It is possible that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] is unable to work this charm, she may not have reached [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/NEWT exams|NEWT-level]] in Charms, but this is not explained.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Fir0002. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Fir0002~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Mumps ==

Mumps (also referred to as 'M') is a general purpose programming language that supports a native hierarchical data base facility. It is supported by a large user community (mainly biomedical), and a diversified installed application software base. The language originated in the mid-60's at the Massachusetts General Hospital and it became widely used in both clinical and commercial settings. A dwindling number of implementations exist for the language. There have been ANSI, ISO (ISO/IEC 11756:1992) and DOD approved standards for Mumps.

As originally conceived, Mumps differed from other mini-computer based languages of the late 1960's by providing: 1) an easily manipulated hierarchical (multi-dimensional) data base that was well suited to representing medical records; 2) flexible string handling support; and (3) multiple concurrent tasks in limited memory on very small machines. Syntactically, Mumps is based on an earlier language named JOSS and has an appearance that is similar to early versions of Basic that were also based on JOSS.

= File::Stat =

A File::Stat object is one that contains a file's status information.

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
stat = File.stat('/etc') # a File::Stat object
if stat.directory?
  puts '/etc is a directory last modified at ' + stat.mtime.to_s
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also get a stat object for open file descriptors.
&lt;pre&gt;
a = File.open('some file')
a.stat # File::Stat object
&lt;/pre&gt;

&quot;... DXplain, a decision support system developed at the Laboratory of Computer Science at the Massachusetts General Hospital, has the characteristics of both an electronic medical textbook and a medical reference system. In its reference or case analysis mode, DXplain accepts a set of clinical findings (signs, symptoms, laboratory data) to produce a ranked list of diagnoses which might explain (or be associated with) the clinical manifestations. DXplain provides justification for why each of these diseases might be considered, suggests what further clinical information would be useful to collect for each disease, and lists what clinical manifestations, if any, would be unusual or atypical for each of the specific diseases.

In the role of a medical textbook, DXplain can provide a description of over 2200 different diseases, emphasizing the signs and symptoms that occur in each disease, the etiology, the pathology, and the prognosis. DXplain also provides up to 10 references for each disease, selected to emphasize clinical reviews where these were available. In addition, DXplain can provide a list of diseases which should be considered for any one of over 4900 different clinical manifestations (signs, symptoms, and laboratory examinations)...&quot; (from the link above)

:&quot;...Miller RA, Masarie FE Jr.

:The original goal of the INTERNIST-1 project, as formulated in the early 1970s, was to develop an expert consultant program for diagnosis in general internal medicine. By the early 1980s, it was recognized that the most valuable product of the project was its medical knowledge base (KB). The INTERNIST-1/QMR KB comprehensively summarizes information contained in the medical literature regarding diagnosis of disorders seen in internal medicine. The QMR program was developed to enable its users to exploit the contents of the INTERNIST-1/QMR KB in educationally, clinically, and computationally useful ways. Utilizing commonly available microcomputers, the program operates at three levels--as an electronic textbook, as an intermediate level spreadsheet for the combination and exploration of simple diagnostic concepts, and as an expert consultant program. The electronic textbook contains an average of 85 findings and 8 associated disorders relevant to the diagnosis of approximately 600 disorders in internal medicine. Inverting the disease profiles creates extensive differential diagnosis lists for the over 4250 patient findings known to the system. Unlike a standard printed medical textbook, the QMR knowledge base can be manipulated &quot;on the fly&quot; to format displays that match the information needs of users. Preliminary use of the program for education of medical students and medical house officers at several sites has met with an enthusiastic response. ...&quot; (from the link above).

=== A funny cookbook ===

This funny little program produces random cooking recipes. Small as it is, it can produce 900 different recipes, though they might not be to everybody's taste... The basic idea is to pick an arbitrary element from a list, which is easily done in Tcl with the following:

 proc ? L {lindex $L [expr {int(rand()*[llength $L])}]}

This is used several times in:

 proc recipe {} {
   set a {
     {3 eggs} {an apple} {a pound of garlic}
     {a pumpkin} {20 marshmallows}
   }
   set b {
     {Cut in small pieces} {Dissolve in lemonade}
     {Bury in the ground for 3 months}
     {Bake at 300 degrees} {Cook until tender}
   }
   set c {parsley snow nutmeg curry raisins cinnamon}
   set d {
      ice-cream {chocolate cake} spinach {fried potatoes} rice {soy sprouts}
   }
   return &quot;   Take [? $a].
   [? $b].
   Top with [? $c].
   Serve with [? $d].&quot;
 }

And as modern programs always need a GUI, here is a minimal one that appears when you source this file at top level, and shows a new recipe every time you click on it:

 if {[file tail [info script]]==[file tail $argv0]} {
   package require Tk
   pack [text .t -width 40 -height 5]
   bind .t &lt;1&gt; {showRecipe %W; break}
   proc showRecipe w {
     $w delete 1.0 end
     $w insert end [recipe]
   }
   showRecipe .t
 }

Enjoy!

=== A little A/D clock ===

This is a clock that shows time either analog or digital - just click on it to toggle. 
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env tclsh
package require Tk

proc every {ms body} {eval $body; after $ms [info level 0]}

proc drawhands w {
    $w delete hands
    set secSinceMidnight [expr {[clock sec]-[clock scan 00:00:00]}]
    foreach divisor {60 3600 43200} length {45 40 30} width {1 3 7} {
       set angle [expr {$secSinceMidnight * 6.283185 / $divisor}]
       set x [expr {50 + $length * sin($angle)}]
       set y [expr {50 - $length * cos($angle)}]
       $w create line 50 50 $x $y -width $width -tags hands
    }
}
proc toggle {w1 w2} {
    if [winfo ismapped $w2] {
        foreach {w2 w1} [list $w1 $w2] break ;# swap
    }
    pack forget $w1
    pack $w2
}
#-- Creating the analog clock:
canvas .analog -width 100 -height 100 -bg white
every 1000 {drawhands .analog}
pack .analog

#-- Creating the digital clock:
label .digital -textvar ::time -font {Courier 24}
every 1000 {set ::time [clock format [clock sec] -format %H:%M:%S]}

bind . &lt;1&gt; {toggle .analog .digital}
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== A little pie chart ===
[[image:TkPiechart.jpg]]

Arc elements of a canvas are by default rendered as pie slices (part of the circumference of a circle, connected by radius lines to the center. Hence it s rather easy to produce a pie chart. The following code is a bit more complex, as it also determines positions for the labels of the pies:

 proc piechart {w x y width height data} {
    set coords [list $x $y [expr {$x+$width}] [expr {$y+$height}]]
    set xm  [expr {$x+$width/2.}]
    set ym  [expr {$y+$height/2.}]
    set rad [expr {$width/2.+20}]
    set sum 0
    foreach item $data {set sum [expr {$sum + [lindex $item 1]}]}
    set start 270
    foreach item $data {
        foreach {name n color} $item break
        set extent [expr {$n*360./$sum}]
        $w create arc $coords -start $start -extent $extent -fill $color
        set angle [expr {($start-90+$extent/2)/180.*acos(-1)}]
        set tx [expr $xm-$rad*sin($angle)]
        set ty [expr $ym-$rad*cos($angle)]
        $w create text $tx $ty -text $name:$n  -tag txt
        set start [expr $start+$extent]
    }
    $w raise txt
 }

Testing:

 pack [canvas .c -bg white]
 piechart .c 50 50 150 150 {
    {SPD  199 red}
    {CDU  178 gray}
    {CSU   23 blue}
    {FDP   60 yellow}
    {Grüne 58 green}
    {Linke 55 purple}
 }

=== A little 3D bar chart ===
[[image:3DBarchart.jpg]]

The following script displays a bar chart on a canvas, with pseudo-3-dimensional bars - a rectangle in front as specified, embellished with two polygons - one for the top, one for the side:}

 proc 3drect {w args} {
    if [string is int -strict [lindex $args 1]] {
       set coords [lrange $args 0 3]
    } else {
       set coords [lindex $args 0]
    }
    foreach {x0 y0 x1 y1} $coords break
    set d [expr {($x1-$x0)/3}]
    set x2 [expr {$x0+$d+1}]
    set x3 [expr {$x1+$d}]
    set y2 [expr {$y0-$d+1}]
    set y3 [expr {$y1-$d-1}]
    set id [eval [list $w create rect] $args]
    set fill [$w itemcget $id -fill]
    set tag [$w gettags $id]
    $w create poly $x0 $y0 $x2 $y2 $x3 $y2 $x1 $y0 \
        -fill [dim $fill 0.8] -outline black
    $w create poly $x1 $y1 $x3 $y3 $x3 $y2 $x1 $y0 \
        -fill [dim $fill 0.6] -outline black -tag $tag
 }
For a more plastic look, the fill color of the polygons is reduced in brightness (&quot;dimmed&quot;):

 proc dim {color factor} {
   foreach i {r g b} n [winfo rgb . $color] d [winfo rgb . white] {
      set $i [expr int(255.*$n/$d*$factor)]
   }
   format #%02x%02x%02x $r $g $b
 }
Draw a simple scale for the y axis, and return the scaling factor:
 proc yscale {w x0 y0 y1 min max} {
   set dy   [expr {$y1-$y0}]
   regexp {([1-9]+)} $max -&gt; prefix
   set stepy [expr {1.*$dy/$prefix}]
   set step [expr {$max/$prefix}]
   set y $y0
   set label $max
   while {$label&gt;=$min} {
      $w create text $x0 $y -text $label -anchor w
      set y [expr {$y+$stepy}]
      set label [expr {$label-$step}]
   }
   expr {$dy/double($max)}
 }
An interesting sub-challenge was to round numbers very roughly, to 1 or maximally 2 significant digits - by default rounding up, add &quot;-&quot; to round down:

 proc roughly {n {sgn +}} {
   regexp {(.+)e([+-])0*(.+)} [format %e $n] -&gt; mant sign exp
   set exp [expr $sign$exp]
   if {abs($mant)&lt;1.5} {
      set mant [expr $mant*10]
      incr exp -1
   }
   set t [expr round($mant $sgn 0.49)*pow(10,$exp)]
   expr {$exp&gt;=0? int($t): $t}
 }
So here is my little bar chart generator. Given a canvas pathname, a bounding rectangle, and the data to display (a list of {name value color} triples), it figures out the geometry. A gray &quot;ground plane&quot; is drawn first. Note how negative values are tagged with &quot;d&quot;(eficit), so they look like they &quot;drop through the plane&quot;.

 proc bars {w x0 y0 x1 y1 data} {
    set vals 0
    foreach bar $data {
       lappend vals [lindex $bar 1]
    }
    set top [roughly [max $vals]]
    set bot [roughly [min $vals] -]
    set f [yscale $w $x0 $y0 $y1 $bot $top]
    set x [expr $x0+30]
    set dx [expr ($x1-$x0-$x)/[llength $data]]
    set y3 [expr $y1-20]
    set y4 [expr $y1+10]
    $w create poly $x0 $y4 [expr $x0+30] $y3 $x1 $y3 [expr $x1-20] $y4 -fill gray65
    set dxw [expr $dx*6/10]
    foreach bar $data {
       foreach {txt val col} $bar break
       set y [expr {round($y1-($val*$f))}]
       set y1a $y1
       if {$y&gt;$y1a} {swap y y1a}
       set tag [expr {$val&lt;0? &quot;d&quot;: &quot;&quot;}]
       3drect $w $x $y [expr $x+$dxw] $y1a -fill $col -tag $tag
       $w create text [expr {$x+12}] [expr {$y-12}] -text $val
       $w create text [expr {$x+12}] [expr {$y1a+2}] -text $txt -anchor n
       incr x $dx
    }
    $w lower d
 }
Generally useful helper functions:

 proc max list {
    set res [lindex $list 0]
    foreach e [lrange $list 1 end] {
       if {$e&gt;$res} {set res $e}
    }
    set res
 }
 proc min list {
    set res [lindex $list 0]
    foreach e [lrange $list 1 end] {
       if {$e&lt;$res} {set res $e}
    }
    set res
 }
 proc swap {_a _b} {
    upvar 1 $_a a $_b b
    foreach {a b} [list $b $a] break
 }
Testing the whole thing (see screenshot):

 pack [canvas .c -width 240 -height 280]
 bars .c 10 20 240 230 {
   {red 765 red}
   {green 234 green}
   {blue 345 blue}
   {yel-\nlow 321 yellow}
   {ma-\ngenta 567 magenta}
   {cyan -123 cyan}
   {white 400 white}
 }
 .c create text 120 10 -anchor nw -font {Helvetica 18} -text &quot;Bar Chart\nDemo&quot;

=== A little calculator ===

[[Image:Calculator.jpg]]

Here is a small calculator in Tcl/Tk. In addition to the buttons on screen, you can use any of expr's other functionalities via keyboard input. 

 package require Tk
 wm title . Calculator
 grid [entry .e -textvar e -just right] -columnspan 5
 bind .e &lt;Return&gt; =
 set n 0
 foreach row {
    {7 8 9 + -}
    {4 5 6 * /}
    {1 2 3 ( )}
    {C 0 . =  }
 } {
    foreach key $row {
        switch -- $key {
            =       {set cmd =}
            C       {set cmd {set clear 1; set e &quot;&quot;}}
            default {set cmd &quot;hit $key&quot;}
        }
        lappend keys [button .[incr n] -text $key -command $cmd]
    }
    eval grid $keys -sticky we ;#-padx 1 -pady 1
    set keys [list]
 }
 grid .$n -columnspan 2 ;# make last key (=) double wide
 proc = {} {
    regsub { =.+} $::e &quot;&quot; ::e ;# maybe clear previous result
    if [catch {set ::res [expr [string map {/ *1.0/} $::e]]}] {
        .e config -fg red
    }
    append ::e = $::res 
    .e xview end
    set ::clear 1
 }
 proc hit {key} {
    if $::clear {
        set ::e &quot;&quot;
        if ![regexp {[0-9().]} $key] {set ::e $::res}
        .e config -fg black
        .e icursor end
        set ::clear 0
    }
    .e insert end $key
 }
 set clear 0
 focus .e           ;# allow keyboard input
 wm resizable . 0 0

And, as Cameron Laird noted, this thingy is even programmable: enter for example

 [proc fac x {expr {$x&lt;2? 1: $x*[fac [incr x -1]]}}]
into the entry, disregard warnings; now you can do

 [fac 10]
and receive [fac 10] = 3628800.0 as result...

=== A little slide rule ===

The slide rule was an analog, mechanical device for approximate engineering computing, made obsolete by the pocket calculator since about the 1970-80s. The basic principle is that multiplication is done by adding logarithms, hence most of the scales are logarithmic, with uneven increments.

[[Image:Sliderule_Tk.jpg]]

This fun project recreates a slide rule (roughly an Aristo-Rietz Nr. 89 with 7 scales - high-notch ones had up to 24) with a white &quot;body&quot; and a beige &quot;slide&quot; which you can move left or right with mouse button 1 clicked, or in pixel increment with the &lt;Shift-Left&gt;/&lt;Shift-Right&gt; cursor keys. Finally, the blue line represents the &quot;mark&quot; (how is that correctly called? &quot;runner&quot;? &quot;slider&quot;?) which you can move with the mouse over the whole thing to read a value. Fine movements with &lt;Left&gt;/&lt;Right&gt;.

Due to rounding errors (integer pixels), this plaything is even less precise than a physical slide rule was, but maybe you still enjoy the memories... The screenshot shows how I found out that 3 times 7 is approx. 21... (check the A and B scales).

=== A minimal doodler ===
Here is a tiny but complete script that allows doodling (drawing with the mouse) on a canvas widget:

 proc doodle {w {color black}} {
    bind $w &lt;1&gt;         [list doodle'start %W %x %y $color]
    bind $w &lt;B1-Motion&gt; {doodle'move %W %x %y}
 }
 proc doodle'start {w x y color} {
    set ::_id [$w create line $x $y $x $y -fill $color]
 }
 proc doodle'move {w x y} {
    $w coords $::_id [concat [$w coords $::_id] $x $y]
 }
 pack [canvas .c -bg white] -fill both -expand 1
 doodle       .c
 bind .c &lt;Double-3&gt; {%W delete all}

[[Image:Doodler.jpg]]

And here it comes again, but this time with explanations:

The &quot;Application Program Interface&quot; (API) for this, if you want such ceremonial language, is the doodle command, where you specify which canvas widget should be enabled to doodle, and in which color (defaults to black):}

 proc doodle {w {color black}} {
    bind $w &lt;1&gt;         [list doodle'start %W %x %y $color]
    bind $w &lt;B1-Motion&gt; {doodle'move %W %x %y}
 }

It registers two bindings for the canvas, one (&lt;1&gt;) when the left mouse-button is clicked, and the other when the mouse is moved with button 1 (left) down. Both bindings just call one internal function each.

On left-click, a line item is created on the canvas in the specified fill color, but with no extent yet, as start and end points coincide. The item ID (a number assigned by the canvas) is kept in a global variable, as it will have to persist long after this procedure has returned:

 proc doodle'start {w x y color} {
    set ::_id [$w create line $x $y $x $y -fill $color]
 }

The left-motion procedure obtains the coordinates (alternating x and y) of the globally known doodling line object, appends the current coordinates to it, and makes this the new cooordinates - in other words, extends the line to the current mouse position:

 proc doodle'move {w x y} {
    $w coords $::_id [concat [$w coords $::_id] $x $y]
 }

That's all we need to implement doodling - now let's create a canvas to test it, and pack it so it can be drawn as big as you wish:

 pack [canvas .c -bg white] -fill both -expand 1

And this line turns on the doodle functionality created above (defaulting to black):

 doodle       .c

Add a binding for double-right-click/double-button-3, to clear the canvas (added by MG, Apr 29 04)

 bind .c &lt;Double-3&gt; {%W delete all}

=== A tiny drawing program ===

Here is a tiny drawing program on a canvas. Radio buttons on top allow choice of draw mode and fill color. In &quot;Move&quot; mode, you can of course move items around. Right-click on an item to delete it.

[[Image:Tinydraw.jpg]]

A radio is an obvious &quot;megawidget&quot; to hold a row of radiobuttons. This simple one allows text or color mode: }

 proc radio {w var values {col 0}} {
    frame $w
    set type [expr {$col? &quot;-background&quot; : &quot;-text&quot;}]
    foreach value $values {
        radiobutton $w.v$value $type $value -variable $var -value $value \
            -indicatoron 0
        if $col {$w.v$value config -selectcolor $value -borderwidth 3}
    }
    eval pack [winfo children $w] -side left
    set ::$var [lindex $values 0]
    set w
 }

Depending on draw mode, the mouse events &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;Motion&quot; have different handlers, which are dispatched by names that look like array elements. So for a mode X, we need a pair of procs, down(X) and move(X). Values used between calls are kept in global variables.

First, the handlers for free-hand line drawing:

 proc down(Draw) {w x y} {
    set ::ID [$w create line $x $y $x $y -fill $::Fill]
 }
 proc move(Draw) {w x y} {
    $w coords $::ID [concat [$w coords $::ID] $x $y]
 }

 #-- Movement of an item
 proc down(Move) {w x y} {
    set ::ID [$w find withtag current]
    set ::X $x; set ::Y $y
 }
 proc move(Move) {w x y} {
    $w move $::ID [expr {$x-$::X}] [expr {$y-$::Y}]
    set ::X $x; set ::Y $y
 }

 #-- Clone an existing item
 proc serializeCanvasItem {c item} {
    set data [concat [$c type $item] [$c coords $item]]
    foreach opt [$c itemconfigure $item] {
        # Include any configuration that deviates from the default
        if {[lindex $opt end] != [lindex $opt end-1]} {
            lappend data [lindex $opt 0] [lindex $opt end]
            }
        }
    return $data
    }
 proc down(Clone) {w x y} {
    set current [$w find withtag current]
    if {[string length $current] &gt; 0} {
        set itemData [serializeCanvasItem $w [$w find withtag current]]
        set ::ID [eval $w create $itemData]
        set ::X $x; set ::Y $y
    }
 }
 interp alias {} move(Clone) {} move(Move)

 #-- Drawing a rectangle
 proc down(Rect) {w x y} {
    set ::ID [$w create rect $x $y $x $y -fill $::Fill]
 }
 proc move(Rect) {w x y} {
    $w coords $::ID [lreplace [$w coords $::ID] 2 3 $x $y]
 }

 #-- Drawing an oval (or circle, if you're careful)
 proc down(Oval) {w x y} {
    set ::ID [$w create oval $x $y $x $y -fill $::Fill]
 }
 proc move(Oval) {w x y} {
    $w coords $::ID [lreplace [$w coords $::ID] 2 3 $x $y]
 }

Polygons are drawn by clicking the corners. When a corner is close enough to the first one, the polygon is closed and drawn.

 proc down(Poly) {w x y} {
    if [info exists ::Poly] {
        set coords [$w coords $::Poly]
        foreach {x0 y0} $coords break
        if {hypot($y-$y0,$x-$x0)&lt;10} {
            $w delete $::Poly
            $w create poly [lrange $coords 2 end] -fill $::Fill
            unset ::Poly
        } else {
            $w coords $::Poly [concat $coords $x $y]
        }
    } else {
        set ::Poly [$w create line $x $y $x $y -fill $::Fill]
    }

 bind .c &lt;3&gt;         {%W delete current}

For saving the current image, you need the Img extension, so just omit the following binding if you don't have Img:

 bind . &lt;F1&gt; {
    package require Img
    set img [image create photo -data .c]
    set name [tk_getSaveFile -filetypes {{GIFF .gif} {&quot;All files&quot; *}}\
        -defaultextension .gif]
    if {$name ne &quot;&quot;} {$img write $name; wm title . $name}
 }

 #-- This is an always useful helper in development:
 bind . &lt;Escape&gt; {exec wish $argv0 &amp;; exit}

=== A minimal editor ===

Here's an utterly simple editor, in 26 lines of code, which just allows to load and save files, and of course edit, and cut and paste, and whatever is built-in into the text widget anyway. And it has a bit &quot;online help&quot;... ;-)

It is always a good idea to start a source file with some explanations on the name, purpose, author, and date. I have recently picked up the habit to put this information into a string variable (which in Tcl can easily span multiple lines), so the same info is presented to the reader of the source code, and can be displayed as online help: }

 set about &quot;minEd - a minimal editor
 Richard Suchenwirth 2003
 F1: help
 F2: load
 F3: save
 &quot;
The visible part of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) consists of widgets. For this editor, I of course need a text widget, and a vertical scrollbar. With the option &quot;-wrap word&quot; for the text widget, another horizontal scrollbar is not needed - lines longer than the window just wrap at word boundaries.

Tk widgets come on the screen in two steps: first, they are created with an initial configuration; then, handed to a &quot;geometry manager&quot; for display. As widget creation commands return the pathname, they can be nested into the manager command (pack in this case), to keep all settings for a widget in one place. This may lead to over-long lines, though.

Although the scrollbar comes to the right of the text, I create and pack it first. The reason is that when a window is made smaller by the user, the widgets last packed first lose visibility.

These two lines also illustrate the coupling between a scrollbar and the widget it controls:

* the scrollbar sends a yview message to it when moved 
* the widget sends a set message to the scrollbar when the view changed, for instance from cursor keys

And these two lines already give us an editor for arbitrarily long text, with built-in capabilities of cut, copy, and paste - see the text man page. Only file I/O has to be added by us to make it really usable.

 pack [scrollbar .y -command &quot;.t yview&quot;] -side right -fill y
 pack [text .t -wrap word -yscrollc &quot;.y set&quot;] -side right -fill both -expand 1

Are you targetting 8.4 or later? If so, add -undo 1 to the options to text and get full undo/redo support!

 pack [text .t -wrap word -yscrollc &quot;.y set&quot; -undo 1] -side right -fill both -expand 1

The other important part of a GUI are the bindings - what event shall trigger what action. For simplicity, I've limited the bindings here to a few of the function keys on top of typical keyboards:

 bind . &lt;F1&gt; {tk_messageBox -message $about}

Online help is done with a no-frills tk_messageBox with the &quot;about&quot; text defined at start of file. - The other bindings call custom commands, which get a filename argument from Tk's file selector dialogs:

 bind . &lt;F2&gt; {loadText .t [tk_getOpenFile]}
 bind . &lt;F3&gt; {saveText .t [tk_getSaveFile]}

These dialogs can also be configured in a number of ways, but even in this simple form they are quite powerful - allow navigation around the file system, etc. On Windows they call the native file selectors, which have a history of previously opened files, detail view (size/date etc.)

When this editor is called with a filename on the command line, that file is loaded on startup (simple as it is, it can only handle one file at a time):

 if {$argv != &quot;&quot;} {loadText .t [lindex $argv 0]}

The procedures for loading and saving text both start with a sanity check of the filename argument - if it's an empty string, as produced by file selector dialogs when the user cancels, they return immediately. Otherwise, they transfer file content to text widget or vice-versa. loadText adds the &quot;luxury&quot; that the name of the current file is also put into the window title. Then it opens the file, clears the text widget, reads all file contents in one go, and puts them into the text widget.

 proc loadText {w fn} {
    if {$fn==&quot;&quot;} return
    wm title . [file tail $fn]
    set fp [open $fn]
    $w delete 1.0 end
    $w insert end [read $fp]
    close $fp
 }

saveText takes care not to save the extra newline that text widgets append at end, by limiting the range to &quot;end - 1 c&quot;(haracter).

 proc saveText {w fn} {
    if {$fn==&quot;&quot;} return
    set fp [open $fn w]
    puts -nonewline $fp [$w get 1.0 &quot;end - 1 c&quot;]
    close $fp
 }

=== File watch ===

Some editors (e.g. PFE, MS Visual Studio) pop up an alert dialog when a file was changed on disk while being edited - that might lead to edit conflicts. Emacs shows a more subtle warning at the first attempt to change a file that has changed on disk.

Here I try to emulate this feature. It is oversimplified because it does not update the mtime (file modification time) to check, once you saved it from the editor itself. So make sure to call text'watch'file again after saving.

Using the global variable ::_twf it is at least possible to avoid false alarms - for a more serious implementation one might use a namespaced array of watchers, indexed by file name, in case you want multiple edit windows. }

 proc text'watch'file {w file {mtime -}} {
    set checkinterval 1000 ;# modify as needed
    if {$mtime eq &quot;-&quot;} {
        if [info exists ::_twf] {after cancel $::_twf}
        set file [file join [pwd] $file]
        text'watch'file $w $file [file mtime $file]
    } else {
        set newtime [file mtime $file]
        if {$newtime != $mtime} {
            set answer [tk_messageBox -type yesno -message \
                &quot;The file\n$file\nhas changed on disk. Reload it?&quot;]
            if {$answer eq &quot;yes&quot;} {text'read'file $w $file}
            text'watch'file $w $file
        } else {set ::_twf [after $checkinterval [info level 0]]}
    }
 }
 proc text'read'file {w file} {
    set f [open $file]
    $w delete 1.0 end
    $w insert end [read $f]
    close $f
 }

 #-- Testing:
 pack [text .t -wrap word] -fill both -expand 1
 set file textwatch.tcl
 text'read'file  .t $file
 text'watch'file .t $file

The dialog should come up when you change the file externally, say by touch-ing it in pure Tcl, which might be done with editing it in another editor, or
 
 file mtime $filename [clock seconds]

=== Tiny presentation graphics ===

This is a crude little canvas presentation graphics that runs on PocketPCs, but also on bigger boxes (one might scale fonts and dimensions there). Switch pages with Left/Right cursor, or left/right mouseclick (though a stylus cannot right-click).

Not many features, but the code is very compact, and with a cute little language for content specification, see example at end (which shows what I presented at the 2003 Euro-Tcl convention in Nuremberg...)}

 proc slide args {
   global slides
   if {![info exist slides]} slide'init
   incr slides(N)
   set slides(title,$slides(N)) [join $args]
 }
 proc slide'line {type args} {
   global slides
   lappend slides(body,$slides(N)) [list $type [join $args]]
 }
 foreach name {* + -} {interp alias {} $name {} slide'line $name}

 proc slide'init {} {
   global slides
   array set slides {

   }
   pack [canvas .c -bg white] -expand 1 -fill both
   foreach e {&lt;1&gt; &lt;Right&gt;} {bind . $e {slide'show 1}}
   foreach e {&lt;3&gt; &lt;Left&gt;} {bind . $e {slide'show -1}}
   wm geometry . +0+0
   after idle {slide'show 0}
 }

 proc slide'show delta {
   upvar #0 slides s
   incr s(show) $delta
   if {$s(show)&lt;1 || $s(show)&gt;$s(N)} {
      incr s(show) [expr -$delta]
   } else {
      set c $s(canvas)
      $c delete all
      set x 10; set y 20
      $c create text $x $y -anchor w -text $s(title,$s(show))\
         -font $s(titlefont) -fill blue
      incr y $s(dy)

      foreach line $s(body,$s(show)) {
         foreach {type text} $line break
         incr y $s(dy)
         $c create text $x $y -anchor w -text $text \
         -font $s($type)

=== Timeline display ===

Yet another thing to do with a canvas: history visualisation of a horizontal time-line, for which a year scale is displayed on top. The following kinds of objects are so far available:

* &quot;eras&quot;, displayed in yellow below the timeline in boxes 
* &quot;background items&quot; that are grey and stretch over all the canvas in height 
* normal items, which get displayed as stacked orange bars

[[Image:Timeliner.jpg]]

You can zoom in with &lt;1&gt;, out with &lt;3&gt; (both only in x direction). On mouse motion, the current year is displayed in the toplevel's title. Normal items can be a single year, like the Columbus example, or a range of years, for instance for lifetimes of persons. (The example shows that Mozart didn't live long...) 

 namespace eval timeliner {
    variable &quot;&quot;
    array set &quot;&quot; {-zoom 1  -from 0 -to 2000}
 }

 proc timeliner::create {w args} {
    variable &quot;&quot;
    array set &quot;&quot; $args
    #-- draw time scale
    for {set x [expr ($(-from)/50)*50]} {$x&lt;=$(-to)} {incr x 10} {
        if {$x%50 == 0} {
            $w create line $x 8 $x 0
            $w create text $x 8 -text $x -anchor n
        } else {
            $w create line $x 5 $x 0
        }
    }
    bind $w &lt;Motion&gt; {timeliner::title %W %x ; timeliner::movehair %W %x}
    bind $w &lt;1&gt; {timeliner::zoom %W %x 1.25}
    bind $w &lt;2&gt; {timeliner::hair %W %x}
    bind $w &lt;3&gt; {timeliner::zoom %W %x 0.8}
 }

 proc timeliner::movehair {w x} {
    variable &quot;&quot;
    if {[llength [$w find withtag hair]]} {
        set x [$w canvasx $x]
        $w move hair [expr {$x - $(x)}] 0
        set (x) $x
    }
 }
 proc timeliner::hair {w x} {
    variable &quot;&quot;
    if {[llength [$w find withtag hair]]} {
        $w delete hair
    } else {
        set (x) [$w canvasx $x]
        $w create line $(x) 0 $(x) [$w cget -height] \
                  -tags hair -width 1 -fill red
    }
 }

 proc timeliner::title {w x} {
    variable &quot;&quot;
    wm title . [expr int([$w canvasx $x]/$(-zoom))]
 }

 proc timeliner::zoom {w x factor} {
    variable &quot;&quot;
    $w scale all 0 0 $factor 1
    set (-zoom) [expr {$(-zoom)*$factor}]
    $w config -scrollregion [$w bbox all]
    if {[llength [$w find withtag hair]]} {
        $w delete hair
        set (x) [$w canvasx $x]
        $w create line $(x) 0 $(x) [$w cget -height] \
                  -tags hair -width 1 -fill red
    }
 }

This command adds an object to the canvas. The code for &quot;item&quot; took me some effort, as it had to locate a free &quot;slot&quot; on the canvas, searching top-down:

 proc timeliner::add {w type name time args} {
    variable &quot;&quot;
    regexp {(\d+)(-(\d+))?} $time -&gt; from - to
    if {$to eq &quot;&quot;} {set to $from}
    set x0 [expr {$from*$(-zoom)}]
    set x1 [expr {$to*$(-zoom)}]
    switch -- $type {
        era    {set fill yellow; set outline black; set y0 20; set y1 40}
        bgitem {set fill gray; set outline {}; set y0 40; set y1 1024}
        item   {
            set fill orange
            set outline yellow
            for {set y0 60} {$y0&lt;400} {incr y0 20} {
                set y1 [expr {$y0+18}]
                if {[$w find overlap [expr $x0-5] $y0 $x1 $y1] eq &quot;&quot;} break
            }
        }
    }
    set id [$w create rect $x0 $y0 $x1 $y1 -fill $fill -outline $outline]
    if {$type eq &quot;bgitem&quot;} {$w lower $id}
    set x2 [expr {$x0+5}]
    set y2 [expr {$y0+2}]
    set tid [$w create text $x2 $y2 -text $name -anchor nw]
    foreach arg $args {
        if {$arg eq &quot;!&quot;} {
            $w itemconfig $tid -font &quot;[$w itemcget $tid -font] bold&quot;
        }
    }
    $w config -scrollregion [$w bbox all]
 }
Here's a sample application, featuring a concise history of music in terms of composers:

 scrollbar .x -ori hori -command {.c xview}
 pack      .x -side bottom -fill x
 canvas    .c -bg white -width 600 -height 300 -xscrollcommand {.x set}
 pack      .c -fill both -expand 1
 timeliner::create .c -from 1400 -to 2000

These nifty shorthands for adding items make data specification a breeze - compare the original call, and the shorthand:

    timeliner::add .c item Purcell 1659-1695
    - Purcell 1659-1695
With an additional &quot;!&quot; argument you can make the text of an item bold:

 foreach {shorthand type} {* era  x bgitem - item} {
    interp alias {} $shorthand {} timeliner::add .c $type
 }

=== Fun with functions ===

[[Image:funplot.jpg]]

My teenage daughter hates math. In order to motivate her, I beefed up an earlier little function plotter which before only took one function, in strict Tcl (expr) notation, from the command line. Now there's an entry widget, and the accepted language has also been enriched: beyond exprs rules, you can omit dollar and multiplication signs, like 2x+1, powers can be written as x3 instead of ($x*$x*$x); in simple cases you can omit parens round function arguments, like sin x2. Hitting &lt;Return&gt; in the entry widget displays the function's graph.

If you need some ideas, click on the &quot;?&quot; button to cycle through a set of demo functions, from boring to bizarre (e.g. if rand() is used). Besides default scaling, you can zoom in or out. Moving the mouse pointer over the canvas displays x and y coordinates, and the display changes to white if you're on a point on the curve.

The target was not reached: my daughter still hates math. But at least I had hours of Tcl (and function) fun again, surfing in the Cartesian plane... hope you enjoy it too!

=== Functional imaging ===

In Conal Elliott's Pan project (&quot;Functional Image Synthesis&quot;, [1]), images (of arbitrary size and resolution) are produced and manipulated in an elegant functional way. Functions written in Haskell (see Playing Haskell) are applied, mostly in functional composition, to pixels to return their color value. FAQ: &quot;Can we have that in Tcl too?&quot;

[[Image:funimj.jpg]]

As the funimj demo below shows, in principle yes; but it takes some patience (or a very fast CPU) - for a 200x200 image the function is called 40000 times, which takes 9..48 seconds on my P200 box. Still, the output often is worth waiting for... and the time used to write this code was negligible, as the Haskell original could with few modifications be represented in Tcl. Functional composition had to be rewritten to Tcl's Polish notation - Haskell's

 foo 1 o bar 2 o grill
(where &quot;o&quot; is the composition operator) would in Tcl look like

 o {foo 1} {bar 2} grill
As the example shows, additional arguments can be specified; only the last argument is passed through the generated &quot;function nest&quot;:

 proc f {x} {foo 1 [bar 2 [grill $x]]}
But the name of the generated function is much nicer than &quot;f&quot;: namely, the complete call to &quot;o&quot; is used, so the example proc has the name

 &quot;o {foo 1} {bar 2} grill&quot;
which is pretty self-documenting ;-) I implemented &quot;o&quot; like this:

 proc o args {
    # combine the functions in args, return the created name
    set name [info level 0]
    set body &quot;[join $args &quot; \[&quot;] \$x&quot;
    append body [string repeat \] [expr {[llength $args]-1}]]
    proc $name x $body
    set name
 }
 # Now for the rendering framework:

 proc fim {f {zoom 100} {width 200} {height -}} {
    # produce a photo image by applying function f to pixels
    if {$height==&quot;-&quot;} {set height $width}
    set im [image create photo -height $height -width $width]
    set data {}
    set xs {}
    for {set j 0} {$j&lt;$width} {incr j} {
        lappend xs [expr {($j-$width/2.)/$zoom}]
    }
    for {set i 0} {$i&lt;$height} {incr i} {
        set row {}
        set y [expr {($i-$height/2.)/$zoom}]
        foreach x $xs {
            lappend row [$f [list $x $y]]
        }
        lappend data $row
    }
    $im put $data
    set im
 }
Basic imaging functions (&quot;drawers&quot;) have the common functionality point -&gt; color, where point is a pair {x y} (or, after applying a polar transform, {r a}...) and color is a Tk color name, like &quot;green&quot; or #010203:

 proc  vstrip p {
    # a simple vertical bar
    b2c [expr {abs([lindex $p 0]) &lt; 0.5}]
 }
 proc udisk p {
    # unit circle with radius 1
    foreach {x y} $p break
    b2c [expr {hypot($x,$y) &lt; 1}]
 }
 proc xor {f1 f2 p} {
    lappend f1 $p; lappend f2 $p
    b2c [expr {[eval $f1] != [eval $f2]}]
 }
 proc and {f1 f2 p} {
    lappend f1 $p; lappend f2 $p
    b2c [expr {[eval $f1] == &quot;#000&quot; &amp;&amp; [eval $f2] == &quot;#000&quot;}]
 }
 proc checker p {
    # black and white checkerboard
    foreach {x y} $p break
    b2c [expr {int(floor($x)+floor($y)) % 2 == 0}]
 }
 proc gChecker p {
    # greylevels correspond to fractional part of x,y
    foreach {x y} $p break
    g2c [expr {(fmod(abs($x),1.)*fmod(abs($y),1.))}]
 }
 proc bRings p {
    # binary concentric rings
    foreach {x y} $p break
    b2c [expr {round(hypot($x,$y)) % 2 == 0}]
 }
 proc gRings p {
    # grayscale concentric rings
    foreach {x y} $p break
    g2c [expr {(1 + cos(3.14159265359 * hypot($x,$y))) / 2.}]
 }
 proc radReg {n p} {
    # n wedge slices starting at (0,0)
    foreach {r a} [toPolars $p] break
    b2c [expr {int(floor($a*$n/3.14159265359))%2 == 0}]
 }
 proc xPos p {b2c [expr {[lindex $p 0]&gt;0}]}

 proc cGrad p {
    # color gradients - best watched at zoom=100
    foreach {x y} $p break
    if {abs($x)&gt;1.} {set x 1.}
    if {abs($y)&gt;1.} {set y 1.}
    set r [expr {int((1.-abs($x))*255.)}]
    set g [expr {int((sqrt(2.)-hypot($x,$y))*180.)}]
    set b [expr {int((1.-abs($y))*255.)}]
    c2c $r $g $b
 }
Beyond the examples in Conal Elliott's paper, I found out that function imaging can also be abused for a (slow and imprecise) function plotter, which displays the graph for y = f(x) if you call it with $y + f($x) as first argument:

 proc fplot {expr p} {
    foreach {x y} $p break
    b2c [expr abs($expr)&lt;=0.04] ;# double eval required here!
 }
Here is a combinator for two binary images that shows in different colors for which point both or either are &quot;true&quot; - nice but slow:}

 proc bin2 {f1 f2 p} {
    set a [eval $f1 [list $p]]
    set b [eval $f2 [list $p]]
    expr {
        $a == &quot;#000&quot; ?
            $b == &quot;#000&quot; ? &quot;green&quot;
            : &quot;yellow&quot;
        : $b == &quot;#000&quot; ? &quot;blue&quot;
        : &quot;black&quot;
    }
 }
 #--------------------------------------- Pixel converters:

 proc g2c {greylevel} {
    # convert 0..1 to #000000..#FFFFFF
    set hex [format %02X [expr {round($greylevel*255)}]]
    return #$hex$hex$hex
 }
 proc b2c {binpixel} {
    # 0 -&gt; white, 1 -&gt; black
    expr {$binpixel? &quot;#000&quot; : &quot;#FFF&quot;}
 }
 proc c2c {r g b} {
    # make Tk color name: {0 128 255} -&gt; #0080FF
    format #%02X%02X%02X $r $g $b
 }
 proc bPaint {color0 color1 pixel} {
    # convert a binary pixel to one of two specified colors
    expr {$pixel==&quot;#000&quot;? $color0 : $color1}
 }

This painter colors a grayscale image in hues of the given color. It normalizes the given color through dividing by the corresponding values for &quot;white&quot;, but appears pretty slow too:

 proc gPaint {color pixel} {
    set abspixel [lindex [rgb $pixel] 0]
    set rgb [rgb $color]
    set rgbw [rgb white]
    foreach var {r g b} in $rgb ref $rgbw {
        set $var [expr {round(double($abspixel)*$in/$ref/$ref*255.)}]
    }
    c2c $r $g $b
 }

This proc caches the results of [winfo rgb] calls, because these are quite expensive, especially on remote X displays - rmax

 proc rgb {color} {
    upvar &quot;#0&quot; rgb($color) rgb
    if {![info exists rgb]} {set rgb [winfo rgb . $color]}
    set rgb
 }
 #------------------------------ point -&gt; point transformers

 proc fromPolars p {
    foreach {r a} $p break
    list [expr {$r*cos($a)}] [expr {$r*sin($a)}]
 }
 proc toPolars p {
    foreach {x y} $p break
    # for Sun, we have to make sure atan2 gets no two 0's
    list [expr {hypot($x,$y)}] [expr {$x||$y? atan2($y,$x): 0}]
 }
 proc radInvert p {
    foreach {r a} [toPolars $p] break
    fromPolars [list [expr {$r? 1/$r: 9999999}] $a]
 }
 proc rippleRad {n s p} {
    foreach {r a} [toPolars $p] break
    fromPolars [list [expr {$r*(1.+$s*sin($n*$a))}] $a]
 }
 proc slice {n p} {
    foreach {r a} $p break
    list $r [expr {$a*$n/3.14159265359}]
 }
 proc rotate {angle p} {
    foreach {x y} $p break
    set x1 [expr {$x*cos(-$angle) - $y*sin(-$angle)}]
    set y1 [expr {$y*cos(-$angle) + $x*sin(-$angle)}]
    list $x1 $y1
 }
 proc swirl {radius p} {
    foreach {x y} $p break
    set angle [expr {hypot($x,$y)*6.283185306/$radius}]
    rotate $angle $p
 }

Now comes the demo program. It shows the predefined basic image operators, and some combinations, on a button bar. Click on one, have some patience, and the corresponding image will be displayed on the canvas to the right. You can also experiment with image operators in the entry widget at bottom - hit &lt;Return&gt; to try. The text of sample buttons is also copied to the entry widget, so you can play with the parameters, or rewrite it as you wish. Note that a well-formed funimj composition consists of:

* the composition operator &quot;o&quot; 
* zero or more &quot;painters&quot; (color -&gt; color) 
* one &quot;drawer&quot; (point -&gt; color) 
* zero or more &quot;transformers&quot; (point -&gt; point)
}

 proc fim'show {c f} {
    $c delete all
    set ::try $f ;# prepare for editing
    set t0 [clock seconds]
    . config -cursor watch
    update ;# to make the cursor visible
    $c create image 0 0 -anchor nw -image [fim $f $::zoom]
    wm title . &quot;$f: [expr [clock seconds]-$t0] seconds&quot;
    . config -cursor {}
 }
  proc fim'try {c varName} {
    upvar #0 $varName var
    $c delete all
    if [catch {fim'show $c [eval $var]}] {
        $c create text 10 10 -anchor nw -text $::errorInfo
    }
 }

Composed functions need only be mentioned once, which creates them, and they can later be picked up by info procs. The o looks nicely bullet-ish here..

 o gRings
 o vstrip
 o xPos
 o {bPaint brown beige} checker

 o {fplot {$y + exp($x)}}
 o checker radInvert
 o gRings {rippleRad 8 0.3}
 o xPos {swirl .75}

=== TkPhotoLab ===

The following code can be used for experiments in image processing, including
* convolutions (see below)
* conversion from color to greylevel
* conversion from greylevel to faux color
* brightness and contrast modification

Tcl is not the fastest in heavy number-crunching, as needed when going over many thousands of pixels, but I wouldn't consider C for a fun project ;) So take your time, or get a real CPU. At least you can watch the progress, as the target image is updated after every row.

[[Image:TkPhotoLab.jpg]] 

''Edge enhancement by Laplace5 filter''

The demo UI shows two images, the original on the left, the processing result on the right. You can push the result to the left with Options/Accept. See the menus for what goodies I have supplied. But what most interested me were &quot;convolutions&quot;, for which you can edit the matrix (fixed at 3x3 - slow enough..) and click &quot;Apply&quot; to run it over the input image. &quot;C&quot; to set the matrix to all zeroes.

Convolution is a technique where a target pixel is colored according to the sum of the product of a given matrix and its neighbors. As an example, the convolution matrix

 1 1 1
 1 1 1
 1 1 1
colors the pixel in the middle with the average of itself and its eight neighbors, which will myopically blur the picture.

 0 0 0
 0 1 0
 0 0 0
should just faithfully repeat the input picture. These

 0  -1  0       -1 -1 -1
 -1  5 -1  or:  -1  9 -1
 0  -1  0       -1 -1 -1
enhance {horizont,vertic}al edges, and make the image look &quot;crispier&quot;. }

The following routines could also be generified into one:

            lappend row [rgb $y $y $y]
        }
        $image put [list $row] -to 0 $i

    }
 }

 proc color2gray2 image {
    set i -1
    foreach inrow [photo2matrix $image] {

        foreach pixel $inrow {
            foreach {r g b} $pixel break
            set y [expr {int(($r + $g + $b)/3.)}]
            lappend row [rgb $y $y $y]
        }
        $image put [list $row] -to 0 [incr i]
        update idletasks
    }
 }

An experiment in classifying graylevels into unreal colors:

 proc gray2color image {
    set i -1
    set colors {black darkblue blue purple red orange yellow white}
    set n [llength $colors]
    foreach inrow [photo2matrix $image] {
        set row {}
        foreach pixel $inrow {
            set index [expr {[lindex $pixel 0]*$n/256}]
            lappend row [lindex $colors $index]
        }
        $image put [list $row] -to 0 [incr i]
        update idletasks
    }
 }

 proc grayWedge image {
    $image blank
    for {set i 0} {$i&lt;256} {incr i} {
        $image put [rgb $i $i $i] -to $i 0 [expr {$i+1}] 127
    }
 }

A number of algorithms are very similar, distinguished only by a few commands in the center. Hence I made them generic, and they take a function name that is applied to every pixel rgb, resp. a pair of pixel rgb's. They are instantiated by an alias that sets the function fancily as a lambda:

 proc generic_1 {f target source} {
    set w [image width  $source]
    set h [image height $source]
    for {set i 0} {$i&lt;$h} {incr i} {
        set row {}
        for {set j 0} {$j&lt;$w} {incr j} {
            foreach {r g b} [$source get $j $i] break
            lappend row [rgb [$f $r] [$f $g] [$f $b]]
        }
        $target put [list $row] -to 0 $i
        update idletasks
    }
 }

 alias invert    generic_1 [lambda x {expr {255-$x}}]
 alias contrast+ generic_1 [lambda x {clip [expr {128+($x-128)*1.25}]}]
 alias contrast- generic_1 [lambda x {clip [expr {128+($x-128)*0.8}]}]

 proc generic_2 {f target with} {
    set w [image width  $target]
    set h [image height $target]
    for {set i 0} {$i&lt;$h} {incr i} {
        set row {}
        for {set j 0} {$j&lt;$w} {incr j} {
            foreach {r g b} [$target get $j $i] break
            foreach {r1 g1 b1} [$with get $j $i] break
            lappend row [rgb [$f $r $r1] [$f $g $g1] [$f $b $b1]]
        }
        $target put [list $row] -to 0 $i
        update idletasks
    }
 }

 alias blend      generic_2 [lambda {a b} {expr {($a+$b)/2}}]
 alias difference generic_2 [lambda {a b} {expr {255-abs($a-$b)}}]

A histogram is a count of which color value occurred how often in the current image, separately for red, green and blue. For graylevel images, the displayed &quot;curves&quot; should exactly overlap, so you see only the blue dots that are drawn last.

 proc histogram {image {channel 0}} {
    set w [image width  $image]
    set h [image height $image]
    for {set i 0} {$i&lt;256} {incr i} {set hist($i) 0}
    for {set i 0} {$i&lt;$h} {incr i} {
        for {set j 0} {$j&lt;$w} {incr j} {
            incr hist([lindex [$image get $j $i] $channel])
        }
    }
    set res {}
    for {set i 0} {$i&lt;256} {incr i} {lappend res $hist($i)}
    set res

        set t0 [clock clicks -milliseconds]
        convolute $::im1 $::im2 [split [$::txt get 1.0 end] \n]
        set dt [expr {([clock click -milliseconds]-$t0)/1000.}]
        set ::info &quot;Ready after $dt sec&quot;
    }

A little wrapper for simplified menu creation - see below for its use:

            .m add cascade -label $head -menu [menu .m.m$head -tearoff 0]
        }
        if [regexp ^-+$ $name] {
            .m.m$head add separator
        } else {.m.m$head add command -label $name -comm $cmd}

      <comment>/* Playing Assembler */ I changed the source language from &quot;tcl&quot; to &quot;asm&quot; because it's more suitable to the code. Previously, the code was poorly highlighted because of the apostrophe within the word &quot;will not&quot;.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most of these example scripts first appeared in the Tclers' Wiki http://wiki.tcl.tk . The author (Richard Suchenwirth) declares them to be fully in the public domain. The following scripts are plain Tcl, they don't use the Tk GUI toolkit (there's a separate chapter for those).

=== Sets as lists ===

Tcl's lists are well suited to represent sets. Here's typical set operations. If you use the tiny testing framework explained earlier, the ''e.g.'' lines make the self-test; otherwise they just illustrate how the operations should work.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc set'contains {set el} {expr {[lsearch -exact $set $el]&gt;=0}}

e.g. {set'contains {A B C} A} -&gt; 1
e.g. {set'contains {A B C} D} -&gt; 0

proc set'add {_set args} {
   upvar 1 $_set set
   foreach el $args {
       if {![set'contains $set $el]} {lappend set $el}
   }
   set set
}

set example {1 2 3}
e.g. {set'add example 4} -&gt; {1 2 3 4}
e.g. {set'add example 4} -&gt; {1 2 3 4}

proc set'remove {_set args} {
   upvar 1 $_set set
   foreach el $args {
       set pos [lsearch -exact $set $el]
       set set [lreplace $set $pos $pos]
   }
   set set
}

e.g. {set'remove example 3} -&gt; {1 2 4}

proc set'intersection {a b} {
   foreach el $a {set arr($el) &quot;&quot;}
   set res {}
   foreach el $b {if {[info exists arr($el)]} {lappend res $el}}
   set res

e.g. {set'intersection {1 2 3 4} {2 4 6 8}} -&gt; {2 4}

proc set'union {a b} {
   foreach el $a {set arr($el) &quot;&quot;}
   foreach el $b {set arr($el) &quot;&quot;}
   lsort [array names arr]
}

e.g. {set'union {1 3 5 7} {2 4 6 8}} -&gt; {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8}

proc set'difference {a b} {
   eval set'remove a $b
}

e.g. {set'difference {1 2 3 4 5} {2 4 6}} -&gt; {1 3 5}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== Hex-dumping a file ===

The following example code opens a file, configures it to binary translation (i.e. line-ends &lt;code&gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt; are not standardized to &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; as usual in C), and prints as many lines as needed which each contain 16 bytes in hexadecimal notation, plus, where possible, the ASCII character.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc file'hexdump filename {
   set fp [open $filename]
   fconfigure $fp -translation binary
   set n 0
   while {![eof $fp]} {
       set bytes [read $fp 16]
       regsub -all {[^\x20-\xfe]} $bytes . ascii
       puts [format &quot;%04X %-48s %-16s&quot; $n [hexdump $bytes] $ascii]
       incr n 16
   }
   close $fp
}

proc hexdump string {
   binary scan $string H* hex
   regexp -all -inline .. $hex
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The &quot;main routine&quot; is a single line that dumps all files given on the command line:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;foreach file $argv {file'hexdump $file}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Sample output, the script applied to itself:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;...&gt; tclsh hexdump.tcl hexdump.tcl
0000 0d 0a 20 70 72 6f 63 20 66 69 6c 65 27 68 65 78  .. proc file'hex
0010 64 75 6d 70 20 66 69 6c 65 6e 61 6d 65 20 7b 0d  dump filename {.
0020 0a 20 20 20 20 73 65 74 20 66 70 20 5b 6f 70 65  .    set fp [ope
0030 6e 20 24 66 69 6c 65 6e 61 6d 65 5d 0d 0a 20 20  n $filename]..
...
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Roman numerals ===

Roman numerals are an additive (and partially subtractive) system with the following letter values:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000; MCMXCIX = 1999
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here's some Tcl routines for dealing with Roman numerals.

'''Sorting roman numerals:''' I,V,X already come in the right order; for the others we have to introduce temporary collation transformations, which we'll undo right after sorting:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc roman:sort list {
   set map {IX VIIII L Y XC YXXXX C Z D {\^} ZM {\^ZZZZ} M _}
   foreach {from to} $map {
       regsub -all $from $list $to list
   }
   set list [lsort $list]
   foreach {from to} [lrevert $map] {
       regsub -all $from $list $to list
   }
   set list
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
'''Roman numerals from integer:''' 

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc roman:numeral {i} {
       set res &quot;&quot;
       foreach {value roman} {
           1000 M 900 CM 500 D 400 CD 100 C 90 XC 50 L 40 XL 
           10 X 9 IX 5 V 4 IV 1 I} {
               while {$i&gt;=$value} {
                       append res $roman
                       incr i -$value
               }
       }
       set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
'''Roman numerals parsed into integer:'''

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc roman:get {s} {
       array set r_v {M 1000 D 500 C 100 L 50 X 10 V 5 I 1}
       set last 99999; set res 0
       foreach i [split [string toupper $s] &quot;&quot;] {
               if [catch {set val $r_v($i)}] {
                   error &quot;un-Roman digit $i in $s&quot;
               }
               incr res $val
               if {$val&gt;$last} {incr res [expr -2*$last]}
               set last $val
       }
       set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== Custom control structures ===
As &quot;control structures&quot; are really nothing special in Tcl, just a set of commands, it is easier than in most other languages to create one's own. For instance, if you would like to simplify the '''for''' loop 
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;for {set i 0} {$i &lt; $max} {incr i} {...}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;for the typical simple cases so you can write instead
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;loop i 0 $max {...}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;here is an implementation that even returns a list of the results of each iteration:
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc loop {_var from to body} {
   upvar 1 $_var var
   set res {}
   for {set var $from} {$var &lt; $to} {incr var} {lappend res [uplevel 1 $body]}
   return $res
 }
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;using this, a ''string reverse'' function can be had as a one-liner:
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc sreverse {str} {
   join [loop i 0 [string length $str] {string index $str end-$i}] &quot;&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
==== Range-aware switch ====
Another example is the following '''range-aware switch''' variation. A range (numeric or strings) can be given as from..to, and the associated scriptlet gets executed if the tested value lies inside that range.

Like in switch, fall-through collapsing of several cases is indicated by &quot;-&quot;, and &quot;default&quot; as final condition fires if none else did. Different from switch, numbers are compared by numeric value, no matter whether given as decimal, octal or hex.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc rswitch {value body} {
  set go 0
  foreach {cond script} $body {
     if {[regexp {(.+)\.\.(.+)} $cond -&gt; from to]} {
          if {$value &gt;= $from &amp;&amp; $value &lt;= $to} {incr go}
     } else {
         if {$value == $cond} {incr go}
     }
     if {$go &amp;&amp; $script ne &quot;-&quot;} { #(2)
         uplevel 1 $script
         break
     }
  }
  if {$cond eq &quot;default&quot; &amp;&amp; !$go} {uplevel 1 $script} ;#(1)
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Testing:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% foreach i {A K c z 0 7} {
     puts $i
     rswitch $i {
        A..Z {puts upper} 
        a..z {puts lower} 
        0..9 {puts digit}
     }
}
A
upper
K
upper
c
lower
z
lower
0
digit
7
digit
% rswitch 0x2A {42 {puts magic} default {puts df}}
magic
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
==== The K combinator ====
A very simple control structure (one might also call it a result dispatcher) is the '''K combinator''', which is almost terribly simple:
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc K {a b} {return $a}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It can be used in all situations where you want to deliver a result that is not the last. For instance, reading a file in one go:
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc readfile filename {
   set f [open $filename]
   set data [read $f]
   close $f
   return $data
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;can be simplified, without need for the ''data'' variable, to:
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc readfile filename {
   K [read [set f [open $filename]]] [close $f]
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Another example, popping a stack:
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc pop _stack {
   upvar 1 $_stack stack
   K [lindex $stack end] [set stack [lrange $stack 0 end-1]]
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This is in some ways similar to LISP's PROG1 construct: evaluate the contained expressions, and return the result of the first one.

=== Rational numbers ===

Rational numbers, a.k.a. fractions, can be thought of as pairs of integers {numerator denominator}, such that their &quot;real&quot; numerical value is numerator/denominator (and not in integer nor &quot;double&quot; division!). They can be more precise than any &quot;float&quot; or &quot;double&quot; numbers on computers, as those can't exactly represent any fractions whose denominator isn't a power of 2 &amp;mdash; consider {{frac|1|3}} which can not at any precision be exactly represented as floating-point number to base 2, nor as decimal fraction (base 10), even if bignum. 

An obvious string representation of a rational is of course &quot;n/d&quot;. The following &quot;constructor&quot; does that, plus it normalizes the signs, reduces to lowest terms, and returns just the integer n if d==1:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc rat {n d} {
  if {!$d} {error &quot;denominator can't be 0&quot;}
  if {$d&lt;0} {set n [- $n]; set d [- $d]}
  set g [gcd $n $d]
  set n [/ $n $g]
  set d [/ $d $g]
  expr {$d==1? $n: &quot;$n/$d&quot; }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Conversely, this &quot;deconstructor&quot; splits zero or more rational or integer strings into num and den variables, such that [ratsplit 1/3 a b] assigns 1 to a and 3 to b:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc ratsplit args {
   foreach {r _n _d} $args {
      upvar 1 $_n n  $_d d
      foreach {n d} [split $r /] break
      if {$d eq &quot;&quot;} {set d 1}
   }
}

#-- Four-species math on &quot;rats&quot;:
proc rat+ {r s} {
   ratsplit $r a b $s c d
   rat [+ [* $a $d] [* $c $b]] [* $b $d]
}
proc rat- {r s} {
   ratsplit $r a b $s c d
   rat [- [* $a $d] [* $c $b]] [* $b $d]
}
proc rat* {r s} {
   ratsplit $r a b $s c d
   rat [* $a $c] [* $b $d]
}
proc rat/ {r s} {
   ratsplit $r a b $s c d
   rat [* $a $d] [* $b $c]
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Arithmetical helper functions can be wrapped with func if they only consist of one call of ''expr'':

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc func {name argl body} {proc $name $argl [list expr $body]}

#-- Greatest common denominator:
func gcd {u v} {$u? [gcd [% $v $u] $u]: abs($v)}

#-- Binary expr operators exported:
foreach op {+ * / %} {func $op {a b} \$a$op\$b}

#-- &quot;-&quot; can have 1 or 2 operands:
func - {a {b &quot;&quot;}} {$b eq &quot;&quot;? -$a: $a-$b}

#-- a little tester reports the unexpected:
proc ? {cmd expected} {
   catch {uplevel 1 $cmd} res
   if {$res ne $expected} {puts &quot;$cmd -&gt; $res, expected $expected&quot;}
}

=== Docstrings ===

Languages like Lisp and Python have the docstring feature, where a string in the beginning of a function can be retrieved for on-line (or printed) documentation. Tcl doesn't have this mechanism built-in (and it would be hard to do it exactly the same way, because everything is a string), but a similar mechanism can easily be adopted, and it doesn't look bad in comparison:

* Common Lisp: (documentation 'foo 'function) 
* Python: foo.__doc__ 
* Tcl: docstring foo

If the docstring is written in comments at the top of a proc body, it is easy to parse it out. In addition, for all procs, even without docstring, you get the &quot;signature&quot; (proc name and arguments with defaults). The code below also serves as usage example: }

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc docstring procname {
   # reports a proc's args and leading comments.
   # Multiple documentation lines are allowed.
   set res &quot;{usage: $procname [uplevel 1 [list info args $procname]]}&quot;
   # This comment should not appear in the docstring
   foreach line [split [uplevel 1 [list info body $procname]] \n] {
       if {[string trim $line] eq &quot;&quot;} continue
       if ![regexp {\s*#(.+)} $line -&gt; line] break
       lappend res [string trim $line]
   }
   join $res \n
}
proc args procname {
   # Signature of a proc: arguments with defaults
   set res &quot;&quot;
   foreach a [info args $procname] {
       if [info default $procname $a default] {
           lappend a $default
       }
       lappend res $a
   }
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Testing:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% docstring docstring
usage: docstring procname
reports a proc's args and leading comments.
Multiple documentation lines are allowed.

% docstring args
usage: args procname
Signature of a proc: arguments with defaults
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== Factorial ===

Factorial (n!) is a popular function with super-exponential growth. Mathematically put,

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;  0! = 1
  n! = n (n-1)! if n &gt;0, else undefined
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In Tcl, we can have it pretty similarly:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc fact n {expr {$n&lt;2? 1: $n * [fact [incr n -1]]}}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But this very soon crosses the limits of integers, giving wrong results.

A math book showed me the Stirling approximation to &lt;code&gt;n!&lt;/code&gt; for large &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; (at Tcl's precisions, &quot;large&quot; is &gt; 20 ...), so I built that in:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc fact n {expr {
    $n&lt;2? 1:
    $n&gt;20? pow($n,$n)*exp(-$n)*sqrt(2*acos(-1)*$n):
           wide($n)*[fact [incr n -1]]}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just in case somebody needs approximated large factorials... But for &lt;code&gt;n&gt;143&lt;/code&gt; we reach the domain limit of floating point numbers. In fact, the float limit is at &lt;code&gt;n&gt;170&lt;/code&gt;, so an intermediate result in the Stirling formula must have busted at 144. For such few values it is most efficient to just look them up in a pre-built table, as Tcllib's &lt;code&gt;math::factorial&lt;/code&gt; does.

=== How big is A4? ===

Letter and Legal paper formats are popular in the US and other places. In Europe and elsewhere, the most widely used paper format is called A4. To find out how big a paper format is, one can measure an instance with a ruler, or look up appropriate documentation. The A formats can also be deduced from the following axioms:

* A0 has an area of one square meter 
* &lt;code&gt;A(n)&lt;/code&gt; has half the area of &lt;code&gt;A(n-1)&lt;/code&gt;
* The ratio between the longer and the shorter side of an A format is constant

How much this ratio is, can easily be computed if we consider that &lt;code&gt;A(n)&lt;/code&gt; is produced from &lt;code&gt;A(n-1)&lt;/code&gt; by halving it parallel to the shorter side, so

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;2a : b = b : a, 
2 a2 = b2, 
b=sqrt(2) a, hence 
b : a = sqrt(2) : 1
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So here is my Tcl implementation, which returns a list of height and width in centimeters (10000 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with two fractional digits, which delivers a sufficient precision of 1/10 mm: }

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc paperA n {
   set w [expr {sqrt(10000/(pow(2,$n) * sqrt(2)))}]
   set h [expr {$w * sqrt(2)}]
   format &quot;%.2f %.2f&quot; $h $w
}
% paperA 4
29.73 21.02
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Bit vectors ===

Here is a routine for querying or setting single bits in vectors, where bits are addressed by non-negative integers. Implementation is as a &quot;little-endian&quot; list of integers, where bits 0..31 are in the first list element, 32..63 in the second, etc.

Usage: '''bit''' ''varName position ?bitval?''

If bitval is given, sets the bit at numeric position position to 1 if bitval &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; 0, else to 0; in any case returns the bit value at specified position. If variable varName does not exist in caller's scope, it will be created; if it is not long enough, it will be extended to hold at least &lt;code&gt;$position+1&lt;/code&gt; bits, e.g. bit foo 32 will turn foo into a list of two integers, if it was only one before. All bits are initialized to 0.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc bit {varName pos {bitval {}}} {
   upvar 1 $varName var
   if {![info exist var]} {set var 0}
   set element [expr {$pos/32}]
   while {$element &gt;= [llength $var]} {lappend var 0}
   set bitpos [expr {1 &lt;&lt; $pos%32}]
   set word [lindex $var $element]
   if {$bitval != &quot;&quot;} {
       if {$bitval} {
           set word [expr {$word | $bitpos}]
       } else {
           set word [expr {$word &amp; ~$bitpos}]
       }
       lset var $element $word
   }
   expr {($word &amp; $bitpos) != 0}
}

#---------------------- now testing...
if {[file tail [info script]] == [file tail $argv0]} {
   foreach {test      expected} {
       {bit foo 5 1}  1
       {set foo}      32
       {bit foo 32 1} {32 1}
   } {
       catch {eval $test} res
       puts $test:$res/$expected
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
This may be used for Boolean properties of numerically indexed sets of items. Example: An existence map of ZIP codes between 00000 and 99999 can be kept in a list of 3125 integers (where each element requires about 15 bytes overall), while implementing the map as an array would take 100000 * 42 bytes in worst case, but still more than a bit vector if the population isn't extremely sparse &amp;mdash; in that case, a list of 1-bit positions, retrieved with &lt;code&gt;lsearch&lt;/code&gt;, might be more efficient in memory usage. Runtime of bit vector accesses is constant, except when a vector has to be extended to much larger length.

Bit vectors can also be used to indicate set membership (set operations would run faster if processing 32 bits on one go with bitwise operators (&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;)) &amp;mdash; or pixels in a binary imary image, where each row could be implemented by a bitvector.

Here's a routine that returns the numeric indices of all set bits in a bit vector:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc bits bitvec {
   set res {}
   set pos 0
   foreach word $bitvec {
       for {set i 0} {$i&lt;32} {incr i} {
           if {$word &amp; 1&lt;&lt;$i} {lappend res $pos}
           incr pos
       }
   }
   set res
}
% bit foo 47 1
1
% bit foo 11 1
1
% set foo
2048 32768
% bits $foo
11 47
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
'''Sieve of Erastothenes''': The following procedure exercises the bit vector functions by letting bits represent integers, and unsetting all that are divisible. The numbers of the bits finally still set are supposed to be primes, and returned:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc sieve max {
   set maxroot [expr {sqrt($max)}]
   set primes [string repeat &quot; 0xFFFFFFFF&quot; [expr {($max+31)/32}]]
   bit primes 0 0; bit primes 1 0
   for {set i [expr $max+1]} {$i&lt;=(($max+31)/32)*32} {incr i} {
       bit primes $i 0 ;# mask out excess bits
   }
   for {set i 2} {$i&lt;=$maxroot} {incr i} {
      if {[bit primes $i]} {
          for {set j [expr $i&lt;&lt;1]} {$j&lt;=$max} {incr j $i} {
              bit primes $j 0
          }
      }
   }
   bits $primes
}
% time {set res [sieve 10000]}
797000 microseconds per iteration
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Here's code to count the number of 1-bits in a bit vector, represented as an integer list. It does so by adding the values of the hex digits:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc bitcount intlist {
   array set bits {
      0 0  1 1  2 1  3 2  4 1  5 2  6 2  7 3
      8 1  9 2  a 2  b 3  c 2  d 3  e 3  f 4
   }
   set sum 0
   foreach int $intlist {
      foreach nybble [split [format %x $int] &quot;&quot;] {
         incr sum $bits($nybble)
      }
   }
   set sum
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Stacks and queues ===

Stacks and queues are containers for data objects with typical access methods:

* push: add one object to the container 
* pop: retrieve and remove one object from the container

In Tcl it is easiest to implement stacks and queues with lists, and the push method is most naturally ''lappend'', so we only have to code a single generic line for all stacks and queues:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;interp alias {} push {} lappend
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
It is pop operations in which stacks, queues, and priority queues differ:

* in a stack, the most recently pushed object is retrieved and removed (last in first out, LIFO) 
* in a (normal) queue, it is the least recently pushed object (first in first out, FIFO) 
* in a priority queue, the object with the highest priority comes first.

Priority (a number) has to be assigned at pushing time &amp;mdash; by pushing a list of two elements, the item itself and the priority, e.g..

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;push toDo [list &quot;go shopping&quot; 2]
push toDo {&quot;answer mail&quot; 3}
push toDo {&quot;Tcl coding&quot; 1}  ;# most important thing to do
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In a frequent parlage, priority 1 is the &quot;highest&quot;, and the number increases for &quot;lower&quot; priorities &amp;mdash; but you could push in an item with 0 for &quot;ultrahigh&quot; ;-) Popping a stack can be done like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc pop name {
   upvar 1 $name stack
   set res [lindex $stack end]
   set stack [lrange $stack 0 end-1]
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Popping a queue is similarly structured, but with so different details that I found no convenient way to factor out things:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc qpop name {
   upvar 1 $name queue
   set res [lindex $queue 0]
   set queue [lrange $queue 1 end]
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Popping a priority queue requires sorting out which item has highest priority. Sorting can be done when pushing, or when popping, and since our push is so nicely generic I prefer the second choice (as the number of pushs and pops should be about equal, it does not really matter). Tcl's lsort is stable, so items with equal priority will remain in the order in which they were queued:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc pqpop name {
   upvar 1 $name queue
   set queue [lsort -real -index 1 $queue]
   qpop queue ;# fall back to standard queue, now that it's sorted
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A practical application is e.g. in state space searching, where the kind of container of the to-do list determines the strategy:

* stack is depth-first 
* (normal) queue is breadth-first 
* priority queue is any of the more clever ways: A*, Greedy, ...

'''Recent-use lists:''' A variation that can be used both in a stack or queue fashion is a list of values in order of their last use (which may come handy in an editor to display the last edited files, for instance). Here, pushing has to be done by dedicated code because a previous instance would have to be removed:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc rupush {listName value} {
     upvar 1 $listName list
     if {![info exist list]} {set list {}}
     set pos [lsearch $list $value]
     set list [lreplace $list $pos $pos]
     lappend list $value
}
% rupush tmp hello
hello
% rupush tmp world
hello world
% rupush tmp again
hello world again
% rupush tmp world
hello again world
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The first element is the least recently, the last the most recently used. Elements are not removed by the popping, but (if necessary) when re-pushing. (One might truncate the list at front if it gets too long).

=== Functions ===

Functions in Tcl are typically written with the ''proc'' command. But I notice more and more that, on my way to functional programming, my ''proc'' bodies are a single call to ''expr'' which does all the rest (often with the powerful &lt;code&gt;x?y:z&lt;/code&gt; operator). So what about a thin abstraction (wrapper) around this recurring pattern?

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc func {name argl body} {proc $name $argl [list expr $body]}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
(I might have called it fun as well... it sure is.) That's all. A collateral advantage is that all expressions are braced, without me having to care. But to not make the page look so empty, here's some examples for func uses:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;func fac n     {$n&lt;2? 1: $n*[fac [incr n -1]]}
func gcd {u v} {$u? [gcd [expr $v%$u] $u]: $v}
func min {a b} {$a&lt;$b? $a: $b}
func sgn x     {($x&gt;0)-($x&lt;0)} ;# courtesy rmax
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Pity we have to make ''expr'' explicit again, in nested calls like in ''gcd'' ... But ''func'' isn't limited to math functions (which, especially when recursive, come out nice), but for ''expr'' uses in testing predicates as well:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;func atomar list          {[lindex $list 0] eq $list}
func empty  list          {[llength $list] == 0}
func in    {list element} {[lsearch -exact $list $element] &gt;= 0}
func limit {x min max}    {$x&lt;$min? $min: $x&gt;$max? $max: $x}
func ladd  {list e}       {[in $list $e]? $list: [lappend list $e]}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Exposing ''expr'' binary arithmetic operators as Tcl commands goes quite easy too:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;foreach op {+ * / %} {func $op {a b} &quot;\$a $op \$b&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;For &quot;-&quot;, we distinguish unary and binary form:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;func - {a {b &quot;&quot;}} {$b eq &quot;&quot;? -$a: $a-$b}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Having the modulo operator exposed, ''gcd'' now looks nicer:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;func gcd {u v} {$u? [gcd [% $v $u] $u]: abs($v)}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
For unary not I prefer that name to &quot;!&quot;, as it might also stand for factorial &amp;mdash; and see the shortest function body I ever wrote :^) :

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;func not x {!$x}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Without big mention, functions implemented by recursion have a pattern for which func is well suited (see ''fac'' and ''gcd'' above). Another example is this integer range generator (starts from 1, and is inclusive, so &lt;code&gt;[iota1 5] == {1 2 3 4 5}&lt;/code&gt;):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;func iota1 n {$n == 1? 1: [concat [iota1 [- $n 1]] $n]}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Experiments with Boolean functions ===

&quot;NAND is not AND.&quot; Here are some Tcl codelets to demonstrate how all Boolean operations can be expressed in terms of the single NAND operator, which returns true if not both his two inputs are true (NOR would have done equally well). We have Boolean operators in ''expr'', so here goes:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc nand {A B} {expr {!($A &amp;&amp; $B)}}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The only unary operator NOT can be written in terms of nand:
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc not {A} {nand $A $A}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
.. and everything else can be built from them too:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc and {A B} {not [nand $A $B]}

proc or {A B} {nand [not $A] [not $B]}

proc nor {A B} {not [or $A $B]}

proc eq {A B} {or [and $A $B] [nor $A $B]}

proc ne {A B} {nor [and $A $B] [nor $A $B]}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Here's some testing tools &amp;mdash; to see whether an implementation is correct, look at its truth table, here done as the four results for A,B combinations 0,0 0,1 1,0 1,1 &amp;mdash; side note: observe how easily functions can be passed in as arguments:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc truthtable f {
   set res {}
   foreach A {0 1} {
       foreach B {0 1} {
           lappend res [$f $A $B]
       }
   }
   set res
}

% truthtable and
0 0 0 1

% truthtable nand
1 1 1 0

% truthtable or
0 1 1 1

% truthtable nor
1 0 0 0

% truthtable eq
1 0 0 1
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
To see how efficient the implementation is (in terms of NAND units used), try this, which relies on the fact that Boolean functions contain no lowercase letters apart from the operator names:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc nandcount f {
   regsub -all {[^a-z]} [info body $f] &quot; &quot; list
   set nums [string map {nand 1 not 1 and 2 nor 4 or 3 eq 6} $list]
   expr [join $nums +]
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
As a very different idea, having nothing to do with NAND as elementary function, the following generic code &quot;implements&quot; Boolean functions very intuitively, by just giving their truth table for look-up at runtime:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc booleanFunction {truthtable a b} {
   lindex $truthtable [expr {!!$a+!!$a+!!$b}]
}

interp alias {} and  {} booleanFunction {0 0 0 1}
interp alias {} or   {} booleanFunction {0 1 1 1}
interp alias {} nand {} booleanFunction {1 1 1 0}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== Solving cryptarithms ===

Cryptarithms are puzzles where digits are represented by letters, and the task is to find out which. The following &quot;General Problem Solver&quot; (for small values of General) uses heavy metaprogramming: it
* builds up a nest of foreachs suiting the problem, 
* quick kills (with continue) to force unique values for the variables, and
*  returns the first solution found, or else an empty string:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc solve {problem {domain0 {0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9}}} {
   set vars [lsort -u [split [regsub -all {[^A-Z]} $problem &quot;&quot;] &quot;&quot;]]
   set map {= ==}
   set outers {}
   set initials [regexp -all -inline {[^A-Z]([A-Z])} /$problem]
   set pos [lsearch $domain0 0]
   set domain1 [lreplace $domain0 $pos $pos]
   foreach var $vars {
       append body &quot;foreach $var \$domain[expr [lsearch $initials $var]&gt;=0] \{\n&quot;
       lappend map $var $$var
       foreach outer $outers {
           append body &quot;if {$$var eq $$outer} continue\n&quot;
       }
       lappend outers $var
       append epilog \}
   }
   set test [string map $map $problem]
   append body &quot;if {\[expr $test\]} {return \[subst $test\]}&quot; $epilog
   if 1 $body
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
This works fine on some well-known cryptarithms:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% solve SEND+MORE=MONEY

&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== Database experiments ===
==== A simple array-based database ====

There are lots of complex databases around. Here I want to explore how a database can be implemented in the Tcl spirit of simplicity, and how far that approach takes us. Consider the following model:

* A database is a set of records 
* A record is a nonempty set of fields with a unique ID 
* A field is a pair of tag and nonempty value, both being strings

Fields may well be implemented as array entries, so we could have an array per record, or better one array for the whole database, where the key is composed of ID and tag. Unique IDs can be had by just counting up (incrementing the highest ID so far). The process of creating a simple database consists only of setting an initial value for the ID:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set db(lastid) 0
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Let's consider a library application for an example. Adding a book to the database can be simply done by

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set id [incr db(lastid)]
set db($id,author) &quot;Shakespeare, William&quot;
set db($id,title) &quot;The Tempest&quot;
set db($id,printed) 1962
set db($id,label) S321-001
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Note that, as we never specified what fields a record shall contain, we can add whatever we see fit. For easier handling, it's a good idea to classify records somehow (we'll want to store more than books), so we add

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set db($id,isa) book
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Retrieving a record is as easy as this (though the fields come in undefined order):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;array get db $id,*
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and deleting a record is only slightly more convolved:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;foreach i [array names db $id,*] {unset db($i)}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;or, even easier and faster from Tcl 8.3 on:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;array unset db $id,*
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here's how to get a &quot;column&quot;, all fields of a given tag:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;array get db *,title
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But real columns may have empty fields, which we don't want to store. Retrieving fields that may not physically exist needs a tolerant access function:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc db'get {_db id field} {
   upvar $_db db
   if {[array names db $id,$field]==&quot;$id,$field&quot;} {
       return $db($id,$field)
   } else {return &quot;&quot;}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
In a classical database we have to define tables: which fields of what type and of which width. Here we can do what we want, even retrieve which fields we have used so far (using a temporary array to keep track of field names):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc db'fields {_db} {
  upvar $_db db
  foreach i [array names db *,*] {
     set tmp([lindex [split $i ,] 1]) &quot;&quot;
  }
  lsort [array names tmp]
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Searching for records that meet a certain condition can be done sequentially. For instance, we want all books printed before 1980:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;foreach i [array names *,printed] {
   if {$db($i)&lt;1980} {
       set id [lindex [split $i ,] 0]
       puts &quot;[db'get db $id author]: [db'get db $id title] $db($i)&quot;
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We might also store our patrons in the same database (here in a different style):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set i [incr $db(lastid)]
array set db [list $i,name &quot;John F. Smith&quot; $i,tel (123)456-7890 $i,isa  patron}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Without a concept of &quot;tables&quot;, we can now introduce structures like in relational databases. Assume John Smith borrows &quot;The Tempest&quot;. We have the patron's and book's ID in variables and do double bookkeeping:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;lappend db($patron,borrowed) $book ;# might have borrowed other books
set db($book,borrower) $patron
set db($book,dueback) 2001-06-12
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When he returns the book, the process is reversed:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set pos [lsearch $db($patron,borrowed) $book]
set db($patron,borrowed) [lreplace $db($patron,borrowed) $pos $pos]
unset db($book,borrower) ;# we're not interested in empty fields
unset db($book,dueback)
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The dueback field (&lt;code&gt;%Y-%M-%d&lt;/code&gt; format is good for sorting and comparing) is useful for checking whether books have not been returned in time:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set today [clock format [clock seconds] -format %Y-%M-%d]]
foreach i [array names db *,dueback] {
   if {$db($i)&lt;$today} {
       set book [lindex [split $i ,] 0] ;# or: set book [idof $i] - see below
       set patron $db($book,borrower)
       #write a letter
       puts &quot;Dear $db($patron,name), &quot;
       puts &quot;please return $db($book,title) which was due on\
       $db($book,dueback)&quot;
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Likewise, parts of the accounting (e.g. orders to, and bills from, booksellers) can be added with little effort, and cross-related also to external files (just set the value to the filename).

''Indexes:'' As shown, we can retrieve all data by sequential searching over array names. But if the database grows in size, it's a good idea to create indexes which cross-reference tags and values to IDs. For instance, here's how to make an authors' index in four lines:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;foreach i [array names db *,author] {
   set book [lindex [split $i ,] 0]
   lappend db(author=[string toupper $db($i)]) $book
}
# and then..
foreach i [lsort [array names db author=SHAK*]] {
   puts &quot;[lindex [split $i =] 1]:&quot; ;# could be wrapped as 'valueof'
   foreach id $db($i) {
       puts &quot;[db'get db $id title] - [db'get db $id label]&quot;
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;gives us a books list of all authors matching the given glob pattern (we reuse Tcl's functionality, instead of reinventing it...). Indexes are useful for repeated information that is likely to be searched. Especially, indexing the isa field allows iterating over &quot;tables&quot; (which we still don't explicitly have!;-):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;regsub -all isa= [array names db isa=*] &quot;&quot; tables
foreach patron $db(isa=patron) {...}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;And beyond industry-standard SQL, we can search multiple indices in one query:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;array names db *=*MARK*
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;gives you all (case-independent) occurrences of MARK, be it in patron's names, book's authors or titles. As versatile as good old grep...

'''Persistence:''' Databases are supposed to exist between sessions, so here's how to save a database to a file:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set fp [open Library.db w]
puts $fp [list array set db [array get db]]
close $fp
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and loading a database is even easier (on re-loading, better unset the array before):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;source Library.db
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If you use characters outside your system encoding (no problem to write Japanese book titles in Kanji), you'll have to fconfigure (e.g -encoding utf-8) on saving and loading, but that's just a few more LOC. Saving also goes a good way to what is ceremonially called &quot;committing&quot; (you'll need write-locking for multi-user systems), while loading (without saving before) might be called a &quot;one-level rollback&quot;, where you want to discard your latest changes.

Notice that so far we have only defined one short proc, all other operations were done with built-in Tcl commands only. For clearer code, it is advisable to factor out frequent operations into procs, e.g.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc idof {index} {lindex [split $index ,] 0}
proc db'add {_db data} {
   upvar $_db db
   set id [incr db(lastid)]
   foreach {tag value} $data {set db($id,$tag) $value}
   # might also update indexes here
}
proc db'tablerow {_db id tags} {
   upvar $_db db
   set res {}
   foreach tag $tags {lappend res [db'get db $id $tag]}
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Of course, with growing databases we may reach memory limits: arrays need some extra storage for administration. On the other hand, the present approach is pretty economic, since it does not use field widths (all strings are &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot;), and omits empty fields, while at the same time allowing to add whatever fields you wish. A further optimization could be to tally value strings, and replace the frequent ones with &quot;&lt;code&gt;@$id&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, where &lt;code&gt;db(@$id)&lt;/code&gt; holds the value once, and only db'get has to be adapted to redirect the query.

Also, memory limits on modern computers are somewhere up high... so only at some time in the future you might have (but maybe not want) to change to a complex database ;-)

'''On the limits:''' Tcl arrays may get quite large (one app was reported to store 800000 keys in Greek characters), and at some point enumerating all keys with array names db (which produces one long list) may exceed your available memory, causing the process to swap. In that situation, you can fall back to the (otherwise slower, and uglier) use of a dedicated iterator:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set search [array startsearch db]
while {[array anymore db $search]} {
   set key [array nextelement db $search]
   # now do something with db($key) - but see below!
}
array donesearch db $search
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But neither can you filter the keys you will get with a glob pattern, nor may you add or delete array elements in the loop &amp;mdash; the search will be immediately terminated.

==== Tables as lists of lists ====

Tables are understood here as rectangular (matrix) arrangements of data in rows (one row per &quot;item&quot;/&quot;record&quot;) and columns (one column per &quot;field&quot;/&quot;element&quot;). They are for instance the building blocks of relational databases and spreadsheets. In Tcl, a sensible implementation for compact data storage would be as a list of lists. This way, they are &quot;pure values&quot; and can be passed e.g. through functions that take a table and return a table. No con-/destructors are needed, in contrast to the heavierweight matrix in Tcllib. I know there are many table implementations in Tcl, but like so often I wanted to build one &quot;with my bare hands&quot; and as simple as possible. As you see below, many functionalities can be &quot;implemented&quot; by just using Tcl's list functions.

A nice table also has a header line, that specifies the field names. So to create such a table with a defined field structure, but no contents yet, one just assigns the header list:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set tbl { {firstname lastname phone}}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Note the double bracing, which makes sure tbl is a 1-element list. Adding &quot;records&quot; to the table is as easy as

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;lappend tbl {John Smith (123)456-7890}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Make sure the fields (cells) match those in the header. Here single bracing is correct. If a field content contains spaces, it must be quoted or braced too:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;lappend tbl {{George W} Bush 234-5678}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Sorting a table can be done with lsort -index, taking care that the header line stays on top:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc tsort args {
   set table [lindex $args end]
   set header [lindex $table 0]
   set res [eval lsort [lrange $args 0 end-1] [list [lrange $table 1 end]]]
   linsert $res 0 $header
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Removing a row (or contiguous sequence of rows) by numeric index is a job for lreplace:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set tbl [lreplace $tbl $from $to]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Simple printing of such a table, a row per line, is easy with

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;puts [join $tbl \n]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Accessing fields in a table is more fun with the field names than the numeric indexes, which is made easy by the fact that the field names are in the first row:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc t@ {tbl field} {lsearch [lindex $tbl 0] $field}
% t@ $tbl phone
2
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You can then access cells:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;puts [lindex $tbl $rownumber [t@ $tbl lastname]]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and replace cell contents like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;lset tbl $rownumber [t@ $tbl phone] (222)333-4567
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here is how to filter a table by giving pairs of field name and glob-style expression &amp;mdash; in addition to the header line, all rows that satisfy at least one of those come through (you can force AND behavior by just nesting such calls):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc trows {tbl args} {
   set conditions {}
   foreach {field condition} $args {
       lappend conditions [t@ $tbl $field] $condition
   }
   set res [list [lindex $tbl 0]]
   foreach row [lrange $tbl 1 end] {
       foreach {index condition} $conditions {
           if [string match $condition [lindex $row $index]] {
              lappend res $row
              break; # one hit is sufficient
           }
       }
   }
   set res
}
% trows $tbl lastname Sm*
{firstname lastname} phone {John Smith (123)456-7890}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This filters (and, if wanted, rearranges) columns, sort of what is called a &quot;view&quot;:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc tcols {tbl args} {
   set indices {}
   foreach field $args {lappend indices [t@ $tbl $field]}
   set res {}
   foreach row $tbl {
       set newrow {}
       foreach index $indices {lappend newrow [lindex $row $index]}
       lappend res $newrow
   }
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Programming Languages Laboratory ===
In the following few chapters you'll see how easy it is to emulate or explore other programming languages with Tcl.

==== GOTO: a little state machine ====
The GOTO &quot;jumping&quot; instruction is considered harmful in programming for many years now, but still it might be interesting to experiment with. Tcl has no ''goto'' command, but it can easily be created.
The following code was created in the Tcl chatroom, instigated by the quote: &quot;A computer is a state machine. Threads are for people who can't program state machines.&quot;

So here is one model of a state machine in ten lines of code.
The &quot;machine&quot; itself takes a list of alternating labels and state code; if a state code does not end in a goto or break, the same state will be repeated as long as not left, with goto or break (implicit endless loop).
The goto command is defined &quot;locally&quot;, and deleted after leaving the state machine &amp;mdash; it is not meaningfully used outside of it.
Execution starts at the first of the states. 

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc statemachine states {
   array set S $states
   proc goto label {
       uplevel 1 set this $label
       return -code continue
   }
   set this [lindex $states 0]
   while 1 {eval $S($this)}
   rename goto {}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Testing: a tiny state machine that greets you as often as you wish, and ends if you only hit {{keypress|Return}} on the &quot;how often?&quot; question:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;statemachine {
   1 {
       puts &quot;how often?&quot;
       gets stdin nmax
       if {$nmax eq &quot;&quot;} {goto 3}
       set n 0
       goto 2
   } 2 {
       if {[incr n] &gt; $nmax} {goto 1}
       puts &quot;hello&quot;
   } 3 {puts &quot;Thank you!&quot;; break}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Playing Assembler ====
In this weekend fun project to emulate machine language, I picked those parts of Intel 8080A/8085 Assembler (because I had a detailed reference handy) that are easily implemented and still somehow educational (or nostalgic ;-).

Of course this is no real assembler. The memory model is constant-size instructions (strings in array elements), which are implemented as Tcl procs. So an &quot;assembler&quot; program in this plaything will run even slower than in pure Tcl, and consume more memory &amp;mdash; while normally you associate speed and conciseness with &quot;real&quot; assembler code. But it looks halfway like the real thing: you get sort of an assembly listing with symbol table, and can run it &amp;mdash; I'd hardly start writing an assembler in C, but in Tcl it's fun for a sunny Sunday afternoon... }

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;namespace eval asm {
   proc asm body {
       variable mem
       catch {unset mem} ;# good for repeated sourcing
       foreach line [split $body \n] {
           foreach i {label op args} {set $i &quot;&quot;}
           regexp {([^;]*);} $line -&gt; line ;# strip off comments
           regexp {^ *(([A-Z0-9]+):)? *([A-Z]*) +(.*)} [string toupper $line]\
                -&gt;  -   label           op       args
                puts label=$label,op=$op,args=$args
           if {$label!=&quot;&quot;} {set sym($label) $PC}
           if {$op==&quot;&quot;}     continue
           if {$op==&quot;DB&quot;}  {set mem($PC) [convertHex $args]; incr PC; continue}
           if {$op==&quot;EQU&quot;} {set sym($label) [convertHex $args]; continue}
           if {$op==&quot;ORG&quot;} {set PC [convertHex $args]; continue}
           regsub -all &quot;, *&quot; $args &quot; &quot; args ;# normalize commas
           set mem($PC) &quot;$op $args&quot;
           incr PC
       }
       substituteSymbols sym
       dump   sym
   }
   proc convertHex s {
       if [regexp {^([0-9A-F]+)H$} [string trim $s] -&gt; s] {set s [expr 0x$s]}
       set s
   }
   proc substituteSymbols {_sym} {
       variable mem
       upvar $_sym sym
       foreach i [array names mem] {
           set tmp [lindex $mem($i) 0]
           foreach j [lrange $mem($i) 1 end] {
               if {[array names sym $j] eq $j} {set j $sym($j)}
               lappend tmp $j
           }
           set mem($i) $tmp
       }
   }

       foreach i [lsort -integer [array names mem]] {
           puts [format &quot;%04d %s&quot; $i $mem($i)]
       }
       foreach i [lsort [array names sym]] {
           puts [format &quot;%-10s: %04x&quot; $i $sym($i)]

           #puts &quot;$mem($pc)\tA:$::A B:$::B C:$::C D:$::D E:$::E Z:$::Z&quot;
           eval $mem($pc)
       }
   }

   proc JNZ  where       {if $::Z {uplevel 1 JMP $where}}
   proc JZ   where       {if !$::Z {uplevel 1 JMP $where}}
   proc MOV  {reg adr}   {variable mem; set ::$reg $mem($adr)}
   proc MVI  {reg value} {set ::$reg $value}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Now testing:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;asm::asm {
       org  100     ; the canonical start address in CP/M
       jmp  START   ; idiomatic: get over the initial variable(s)
DONE:  equ  0       ; warm start in CP/M ;-)
MAX:   equ  5
INCR:  db   2       ; a variable (though we won't vary it)
;; here we go...
START: mvi  c,MAX   ; set count limit
       mvi  a,0     ; initial value
       mov  b,INCR
LOOP:  call puts    ; for now, fall back to Tcl for I/O
       inr  a
       add  a,b     ; just to make adding 1 more complicated
       dcr  c       ; counting down..
       jnz  LOOP    ; jump on non-zero to LOOP
       jmp  DONE    ; end of program
       end
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mov b,INCR&lt;/code&gt; part is an oversimplification. For a real 8080, one would have to say

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;LXI H,INCR ; load double registers H+L with the address INCR
MOV B,M    ; load byte to register B from the address pointed to in HL
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Since the pseudo-register M can also be used for writing back, it cannot be implemented by simply copying the value. Rather, one could use read and write traces on variable M, causing it to load from, or store to, mem($HL). Maybe another weekend...

==== Functional programming (Backus 1977) ====
John Backus turned 80 these days. For creating FORTRAN and the BNF style of language description, he received the ACM Turing Award in 1977. In his Turing Award lecture,

''Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs. (Comm. ACM 21.8, Aug. 1978, 613-641)''

he developed an amazing framework for functional programming, from theoretical foundations to implementation hints, e.g. for installation, user privileges, and system self-protection. In a nutshell, his FP system comprises

* a set O of objects (atoms or sequences) 
* a set F of functions that map objects into objects (&lt;code&gt;f : O |-&gt; O&lt;/code&gt;} 
* an operation, application (very roughly, eval) 
* a set FF of functional forms, used to combine functions or objects to form new functions in F 
* a set D of definitions that map names to functions in F

I'm far from having digested it all, but like so often, interesting reading prompts me to do Tcl experiments, especially on weekends. I started with Backus' first Functional Program example,

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;Def Innerproduct = (Insert +) o (ApplyToAll x) o Transpose
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and wanted to bring it to life &amp;mdash; slightly adapted to Tcl style, especially by replacing the infix operator &quot;o&quot; with a Polish prefix style:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;Def Innerproduct = {o {Insert +} {ApplyToAll *} Transpose}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Unlike procs or lambdas, more like APL or RPN, this definition needs no variables &amp;mdash; it declares (from right to left) what to do with the input; the result of each step is the input for the next step (to the left of it). In an RPN language, the example might look like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;/Innerproduct {Transpose * swap ApplyToAll + swap Insert} def
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;which has the advantage that execution goes from left to right, but requires some stack awareness (and some swaps to set the stack right ;^)

Implementing Def, I took an easy route by just creating a proc that adds an argument and leaves it to the &quot;functional&quot; to do the right thing (with some quoting heaven :-) }

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc Def {name = functional} {
   proc $name x &quot;\[$functional\] \$x&quot;
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
For functional composition, where, say for two functions f and g,

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;[{o f g} $x] == [f [g $x]]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
again a proc is created that does the bracket nesting:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc o args {
   set body return
   foreach f $args {append body &quot; \[$f&quot;}
   set name [info level 0]
   proc $name x &quot;$body \$x [string repeat \] [llength $args]]&quot;
   set name
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Why Backus used Transpose on the input, wasn't first clear to me, but as he (like we Tclers) represents a matrix as a list of rows, which are again lists (also known as vectors), it later made much sense to me. This code for transposing a matrix uses the fact that variable names can be any string, including those that look like integers, so the column contents are collected into variables named 0 1 2 ... and finally turned into the result list:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc Transpose matrix {
   set cols [iota [llength [lindex $matrix 0]]]
   foreach row $matrix {
       foreach element $row col $cols {
           lappend $col $element
       }
   }
   set res {}
   foreach col $cols {lappend res [set $col]}
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
An integer range generator produces the variable names, e.g &lt;code&gt;iota 3 =&gt; {0 1 2}&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc iota n {
   set res {}
   for {set i 0} {$i&lt;$n} {incr i} {lappend res $i}
   set res
}

#-- This &quot;functional form&quot; is mostly called map in more recent FP:
proc ApplyToAll {f list} {
   set res {}
   foreach element $list {lappend res [$f $element]}
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
...and Insert is better known as fold, I suppose. My oversimple implementation assumes that the operator is one that expr understands:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc Insert {op arguments} {expr [join $arguments $op]}

#-- Prefix multiplication comes as a special case of this:
interp alias {} * {} Insert *

#-- Now to try out the whole thing:
Def Innerproduct = {o {Insert +} {ApplyToAll *} Transpose}
puts [Innerproduct {{1 2 3} {6 5 4}}]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
which returns 28 just as Dr. Backus ordered (= 1*6 + 2*5 + 3*4). Ah, the joys of weekend Tcl'ing... &amp;mdash; and belatedly, Happy Birthday, John! :)

Another example, cooked up by myself this time, computes the average of a list. For this we need to implement the construction operator, which is sort of inverse mapping &amp;mdash; while mapping a function over a sequence of inputs produces a sequence of outputs of that function applied to each input, Backus' construction maps a sequence of functions over one input to produce a sequence of results of each function to that input, e.g.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;[f,g](x) == &lt;f(x),g(x)&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Of course I can't use circumfix brackets as operator name, so let's call it constr:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc constr args {
   set functions [lrange $args 0 end-1]
   set x [lindex $args end]
   set res {}
   foreach f $functions {lappend res [eval $f [list $x]]}
   set res
}

#-- Testing:
Def mean = {o {Insert /} {constr {Insert +} llength}}
puts [mean {1 2 3 4 5}]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
which returns correctly 3. However, as integer division takes place, it would be better to make that

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc double x {expr {double($x)}}

Def mean    = {o {Insert /} {constr {Insert +} dlength}}
Def dlength = {o double llength}

puts [mean {1 2 3 4}]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
giving the correct result 2.5. However, the auxiliary definition for dlength cannot be inlined into the definition of mean &amp;mdash; so this needs more work... But this version, that maps double first, works:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;Def mean = {o {Insert /} {constr {Insert +} llength} {ApplyToAll double}}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
One more experiment, just to get the feel:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;Def hypot  = {o sqrt {Insert +} {ApplyToAll square}}
Def square = {o {Insert *} {constr id id}}

proc sqrt x {expr {sqrt($x)}}
proc id x   {set x}

puts [hypot {3 4}]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
which gives 5.0. Compared to an RPN language, hypot would be

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;/hypot {dup * swap dup * + sqrt} def
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;which is shorter and simpler, but meddles more directly with the stack.

An important functional form is the conditional, which at Backus looks like
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;p1 -&gt; f; p2 -&gt; g; h
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;meaning, translated to Tcl,

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;if {[p1 $x]} then {f $x} elseif {[p2 $x]} then {g $x} else {h $x}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Let's try that, rewritten Polish-ly to:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;cond p1 f p2 g h

proc cond args {
   set body &quot;&quot;
   foreach {condition function} [lrange $args 0 end-1] {
       append body &quot;if {\[$condition \$x\]} {$function \$x} else&quot;
   }
   append body &quot; {[lindex $args end] \$x}&quot;
   set name [info level 0]
   proc $name x $body
   set name
}

#-- Testing, with K in another role as Konstant function :)
Def abs = {cond {&gt; 0} -- id}

proc &gt; {a b} {expr {$a&gt;$b}}
proc &lt; {a b} {expr {$a&lt;$b}}
proc -- x {expr -$x}
puts [abs -42],[abs 0],[abs 42]

Def sgn = {cond {&lt; 0} {K 1} {&gt; 0} {K -1} {K 0}}
proc K {a b} {set a}

puts [sgn 42]/[sgn 0]/[sgn -42]

#--Another famous toy example, reading a file's contents:
Def readfile = {o 1 {constr read close} open}

#--where Backus' selector (named just as integer) is here:
proc 1 x {lindex $x 0}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==== Reusable functional components ====

Say you want to make a multiplication table for an elementary school kid near you. Easily done in a few lines of Tcl code:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc multable {rows cols} {
   set res &quot;&quot;
   for {set i 1} {$i &lt;= $rows} {incr i} {
       for {set j 1} {$j &lt;= $cols} {incr j} {
           append res [format %4d [expr {$i*$j}]]
       }
       append res \n
   }
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The code does not directly puts its results, but returns them as a string &amp;mdash; you might want to do other things with it, e.g. save it to a file for printing. Testing:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% multable 3 10
  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
  2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20
  3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Or print the result directly from wish:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt; catch {console show}
 puts &quot;[multable 3 10]&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Here's a different way to do it &amp;#224; la functional programming: 

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc multable2 {rows cols} {
   formatMatrix %4d [outProd * [iota 1 $rows] [iota 1 $cols]]
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The body is nice and short, but consists of all unfamiliar commands. They are however better reusable than the ''multable'' proc above. The first formats a matrix (a list of lists to Tcl) with newlines and aligned columns for better display:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc formatMatrix {fm matrix} {
   join [lmap row $matrix {join [lmap i $row {format $fm $i}] &quot;&quot;}] \n
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Short again, and slightly cryptic, as is the &quot;outer product&quot; routine, which takes a function f and two vectors, and produces a matrix where f was applied to every pair of a x b &amp;mdash; in APL they had special compound operators for this job, in this case &quot;&amp;#176;.x&quot;:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc outProd {f a b} {
   lmap i $a {lmap j $b {$f $i $j}}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Again, lmap (the collecting foreach) figures prominently, so here it is in all its simplicity:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc lmap {_var list body} {
   upvar 1 $_var var
   set res {}
   foreach var $list {lappend res [uplevel 1 $body]}
   set res
}

#-- We need multiplication from expr exposed as a function:
proc * {a b} {expr {$a * $b}}

#-- And finally, iota is an integer range generator:
proc iota {from to} {
   set res {}
   while {$from &lt;= $to} {lappend res $from; incr from}
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
With these parts in place, we can see that ''multable2'' works as we want:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% multable2 3 10
  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
  2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20
  3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
So why write six procedures, where one did the job already? A matter of style and taste, in a way &amp;mdash; ''multable'' is 10 LOC and depends on nothing but Tcl, which is good; ''multable2'' describes quite concisely what it does, and builds on a few other procs that are highly reusable. 

Should you need a unit matrix (where the main diagonal is 1, and the rest is 0), just call outProd with a different function (equality, ==):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% outProd == [iota 1 5] [iota 1 5]
{1 0 0 0 0} {0 1 0 0 0} {0 0 1 0 0} {0 0 0 1 0} {0 0 0 0 1}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
which just requires expr's equality to be exposed too:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc == {a b} {expr {$a == $b}}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
One of the fascinations of functional programming is that one can do the job in a simple and clear way (typically a one-liner), while using a collection of reusable building-blocks like lmap and iota. And ''formatMatrix'' and ''outProd'' are so general that one might include them in some library, while the task of producing a multiplication table may not come up any more for a long time...

==== Modelling an RPN language ====

Tcl follows strictly the Polish notation, where an operator or function always precedes its arguments. It is however easy to build an interpreter for a language in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) like Forth, Postscript, or Joy, and experiment with it.

The &quot;runtime engine&quot; is just called &quot;r&quot; (not to be confused with the R language), and it boils down to a three-way switch done for each word, in eleven lines of code:

* &quot;tcl&quot; evaluates the top of stack as a Tcl script 
* known words in the &lt;code&gt;::C&lt;/code&gt; array are recursively evaluated in &quot;r&quot; 
* other words are just pushed
Joy's rich quoting for types ([list], {set}, &quot;string&quot;, 'char) conflict with the Tcl parser, so lists in &quot;r&quot; are {braced} if their length isn't 1, and (parenthesized) if it is &amp;mdash; but the word shall not be evaluated now. This looks better to me than /slashing as in Postscript.

As everything is a string, and to Tcl &quot;a&quot; is {a} is a , Joy's polymorphy has to be made explicit. I added converters between characters and integers, and between strings and lists (see the dictionary below). For Joy's sets I haven't bothered yet &amp;mdash; they are restricted to the domain 0..31, probably implemented with bits in a 32-bit word.

Far as this is from Joy, it was mostly triggered by the examples in Manfred von Thun's papers, so I tongue-in-cheek still call it &quot;Pocket Joy&quot; &amp;mdash; it was for me, at last, on the iPaq... The test suite at end should give many examples of what one can do in &quot;r&quot;. }

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc r args {
   foreach a $args {
     dputs [info level]:$::S//$a
     if {$a eq &quot;tcl&quot;} {
             eval [pop]
     } elseif [info exists ::C($a)] {
             eval r $::C($a)
     } else {push [string trim $a ()]}
   }
   set ::S
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;# That's it. Stack (list) and Command array are global variables:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set S {}; unset C
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;#-- A tiny switchable debugger:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc d+ {} {proc dputs s {puts $s}}
proc d- {}  {proc dputs args {}}
d- ;#-- initially, debug mode off
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Definitions are in Forth style &amp;mdash; &quot;:&quot; as initial word, as they look much more compact than Joy's ''DEFINE n == args;''

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc : {n args} {set ::C($n) $args}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
''expr'' functionality is exposed for binary operators and one-arg functions:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc 2op op {
   set t [pop]

==== Tacit programming ====

The J programming language is the &quot;blessed successor&quot; to APL,  where &quot;every function is an infix or prefix operator&quot;, &lt;code&gt;x?y&lt;/code&gt; (dyadic) or &lt;code&gt;?y&lt;/code&gt; (monadic), for &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; being any pre- or user-defined function).

&quot;Tacit programming&quot; (''tacit'': implied; indicated by necessary connotation though not expressed directly) is one of the styles possible in J, and means coding by combining functions, without reference to argument names. This idea may have been first brought up in Functional programming (Backus 1977), if not in Forth and Joy, and it's an interesting simplification compared to the lambda calculus.

For instance, here's a breathtakingly short J program to compute the mean of a list of numbers:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;mean=.+/%#
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Let's chew this, byte by byte :)

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;=.   is assignment to a local variable (&quot;mean&quot;) which can be called
+/%# is the &quot;function body&quot;
+    (dyadic) is addition
/    folds the operator on its left over the list on its right
+/   hence being the sum of a list
%    (dyadic) is division, going double on integer arguments when needed
#    (monadic) is tally, like Tcl's [llength] resp. [string length]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Only implicitly present is a powerful function combinator called &quot;fork&quot;. When J parses three operators in a row, gfh, where f is dyadic and g and h are monadic, they are combined like the following Tcl version does:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc fork {f g h x} {$f [$g $x] [$h $x]}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
In other words, f is applied to the results of applying g and h to the single argument. Note that &lt;code&gt;+/&lt;/code&gt; is considered one operator, which applies the &quot;adverb&quot; folding to the &quot;verb&quot; addition (one might well call it &quot;sum&quot;). When two operands occur together, the &quot;hook&quot; pattern is implied, which might in Tcl be written as:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc hook {f g x} {$f $x [$g $x]}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
As KBK pointed out in the Tcl chatroom, the &quot;hook&quot; pattern corresponds to Sch&amp;#246;nfinkel/Curry's S combinator (see Hot Curry and Combinator Engine), while &quot;fork&quot; is called S' there.

Unlike in earlier years when I was playing APL, this time my aim was not to parse and emulate J in Tcl &amp;mdash; I expected hard work for a dubitable gain, and this is a weekend fun project after all. I rather wanted to explore some of these concepts and how to use them in Tcl, so that in slightly more verbose words I could code (and call)

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;Def mean = fork /. sum llength
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
following Backus' FP language with the &quot;Def&quot; command. So let's get the pieces together. My &quot;Def&quot; creates an interp alias, which is a good and simple Tcl way to compose partial scripts (the definition, here) with one or more arguments, also known as &quot;currying&quot;:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc Def {name = args} {eval [list interp alias {} $name {}] $args}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The second parameter, &quot;=&quot;, is for better looks only and evidently never used.

Testing early and often is a virtue, as is documentation &amp;mdash; to make the following code snippets clearer, I tuned my little tester for better looks, so that the test cases in the source code also serve as well readable examples &amp;mdash; they look like comments but are code! The cute name &quot;e.g.&quot; was instigated by the fact that in J, &quot;NB.&quot; is used as comment indicator, both being well known Latin abbreviations:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc e.g. {cmd -&gt; expected} {
   catch {uplevel 1 $cmd} res
   if {$res != $expected} {puts &quot;$cmd -&gt; $res, not $expected&quot;}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Again, the &quot;&lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; argument is for eye-candy only &amp;mdash; but it feels better to me at least. See the examples soon to come.

For recursive functions and other arithmetics, func makes better reading, by accepting expr language in the body:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc func {name argl body} {proc $name $argl [list expr $body]}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We'll use this to turn expr's infix operators into dyadic functions, plus the &quot;slashdot&quot; operator that makes division always return a real number, hence the dot :

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;foreach op {+ &amp;mdash; * /} {func $op {a b} &quot;\$a $op \$b&quot;}
        e.g. {+ 1 2} -&gt; 3
        e.g. {/ 1 2} -&gt; 0        ;# integer division
func /. {a b} {double($a)/$b}
        e.g. {/. 1 2} -&gt; 0.5     ;# &quot;real&quot; division

#-- Two abbreviations for frequently used list operations:
proc head list {lindex $list 0}
          e.g. {head {a b c}} -&gt; a
proc tail list {lrange $list 1 end}
          e.g. {tail {a b c}} -&gt; {b c}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
For &quot;fold&quot;, this time I devised a recursive version:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;func fold {neutral op list} {
   $list eq [] ? $neutral
   : [$op [head $list] [fold $neutral $op [tail $list]]]
}
        e.g. {fold 0 + {1 2 3 4}} -&gt; 10

#-- A &quot;Def&quot; alias does the same job:
Def sum = fold 0 +
        e.g. {sum      {1 2 3 4}} -&gt; 10

#-- So let's try to implement &quot;mean&quot; in tacit Tcl!
Def mean = fork /. sum llength
         e.g. {mean {1 2 3 40}} -&gt; 11.5
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Tacit enough (one might have picked fancier names like +/ for &quot;sum&quot; and # as alias for llength), but in principle it is equivalent to the J version, and doesn't name a single argument. Also, the use of llength demonstrates that any good old Tcl command can go in here, not just the artificial Tacit world that I'm just creating...

In the next step, I want to reimplement the &quot;median&quot; function, which for a sorted list returns the central element if its length is odd, or the mean of the two elements adjacent to the (virtual) center for even length. In J, it looks like this:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;median=.(mean@:\{~medind@#)@sortu
medind=.((&lt;.,&gt;.)@half) ` half @.(2&amp;|)
half=.-:@&lt;:                        NB. halve one less than rt. argument
sortu=.\{~/:                       NB. sort upwards
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
which may better explain why I wouldn't want to code in J :^) J has ASCIIfied the zoo of APL strange character operators, at the cost of using braces and brackets as operators too, without regard for balancing, and extending them with dots and colons, so e.g.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;-   monadic: negate; dyadic: minus
-.  monadic: not
-:  monadic: halve
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
J code sometimes really looks like an accident in a keyboard factory... I won't go into all details of the above code, just some:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;@ (&quot;atop&quot;) is strong linkage, sort of functional composition
&lt;. (monadic) is floor()
&gt;. (monadic) is ceil()
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;(&lt;.,&gt;.) is building a list of the floor and the ceiling of its single argument, the comma being the concatenation operator here, comparable to Backus' &quot;construction&quot; or Joy's cleave. The pattern

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;a ` b @. c
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;is a kind of conditional in J, which could in Tcl be written

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;if {[$c $x]} {$a $x} else {$b $x}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;but my variant of the median algorithm doesn't need a conditional &amp;mdash; for lists of odd length it just uses the central index twice, which is idempotent for &quot;mean&quot;, even if a tad slower.

J's &quot;from&quot; operator &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; takes zero or more elements from a list, possibly repeatedly. For porting this, lmap is a good helper, even though not strictly functional:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc lmap {_v list body} {
   upvar 1 $_v v
   set res {}
   foreach v $list {lappend res [uplevel 1 $body]}
   set res
}
e.g. {lmap i {1 2 3 4} {* $i $i}} -&gt; {1 4 9 16}

#-- So here's my 'from':
proc from {indices list} {lmap i $indices {lindex $list $i}}
          e.g. {from {1 0 0 2} {a b c}} -&gt; {b a a c}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We furtheron borrow some more content from expr:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;func ceil  x {int(ceil($x))}
func floor x {int(floor($x))}
   e.g. {ceil 1.5}  -&gt; 2
   e.g. {floor 1.5} -&gt; 1
   e.g. {fork list floor ceil 1.5} -&gt; {1 2}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We'll need functional composition, and here's a recursive de-luxe version that takes zero or more functions, hence the name &lt;code&gt;o*&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;func o* {functions x} {
   $functions eq []? $x
   : [[head $functions] [o* [tail $functions] $x]]
}
e.g. {o* {} hello,world} -&gt; hello,world
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Evidently, identity as could be written

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc I x {set x}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
is the neutral element of variadic functional composition, when called with no functions at all.

If composite functions like 'fork' are arguments to o*, we'd better let unknown know that we want auto-expansion of first word:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc know what {proc unknown args $what\n[info body unknown]}
know {
   set cmd [head $args]
   if {[llength $cmd]&gt;1} {return [eval $cmd [tail $args]]}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Also, we need a numeric sort that's good for integers as well as reals (&quot;Def&quot; serves for all kinds of aliases, not just combinations of functions):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;Def sort = lsort -real
         e.g. {sort {2.718 10 1}} -&gt; {1 2.718 10}
         e.g. {lsort {2.718 10 1}} -&gt; {1 10 2.718} ;# lexicographic

#-- And now for the median test:
Def median = o* {mean {fork from center sort}}
Def center = o* {{fork list floor ceil} {* 0.5} -1 llength}

func -1 x {$x &amp;mdash; 1}
        e.g. {-1 5} -&gt; 4 ;# predecessor function, when for integers

#-- Trying the whole thing out:
e.g. {median {1 2 3 4 5}} -&gt; 3
e.g. {median {1 2 3 4}}   -&gt; 2.5
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
As this file gets tacitly sourced, I am pretty confident that I've reached my goal for this weekend &amp;mdash; even though my median doesn't remotely look like the J version: it is as &quot;wordy&quot; as Tcl usually is. But the admittedly still very trivial challenge was met in truly function-level style, concerning the definitions of median, center and mean &amp;mdash; no variable left behind. And that is one, and not the worst, Tcl way of Tacit programming...

=== Vector arithmetics ===

APL and J (see Tacit programming) have the feature that arithmetics can be done with vectors and arrays as well as scalar numbers, in the varieties (for any operator @):

* scalar @ scalar &amp;rarr; scalar (like expr does) 
* vector @ scalar &amp;rarr; vector 
* scalar @ vector &amp;rarr; vector 
* vector @ vector &amp;rarr; vector (all of same dimensions, element-wise)

Here's experiments how to do this in Tcl. First lmap is a collecting foreach &amp;mdash; it maps the specified body over a list:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc lmap {_var list body} {
    upvar 1 $_var var
    set res {}
    foreach var $list {lappend res [uplevel 1 $body]}
    set res
}

#-- We need basic scalar operators from expr factored out:
foreach op {+ - * / % ==} {proc $op {a b} &quot;expr {\$a $op \$b}&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The following generic wrapper takes one binary operator (could be any suitable function) and two arguments, which may be scalars, vectors, or even matrices (lists of lists), as it recurses as often as needed. Note that as my lmap above only takes one list, the two-list case had to be made explicit with foreach. 

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc vec {op a b} {
    if {[llength $a] == 1 &amp;&amp; [llength $b] == 1} {
        $op $a $b
    } elseif {[llength $a]==1} {
        lmap i $b {vec $op $a $i}
    } elseif {[llength $b]==1} {
        lmap i $a {vec $op $i $b}
    } elseif {[llength $a] == [llength $b]} {
        set res {}
        foreach i $a j $b {lappend res [vec $op $i $j]}
        set res
    } else {error &quot;length mismatch [llength $a] != [llength $b]&quot;}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Tests are done with this minimal &quot;framework&quot;:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc e.g. {cmd -&gt; expected} {
    catch $cmd res
    if {$res ne $expected} {puts &quot;$cmd -&gt; $res, not $expected&quot;}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Scalar + Scalar

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;e.g. {vec + 1 2} -&gt; 3
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Scalar + Vector

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;e.g. {vec + 1 {1 2 3 4}} -&gt; {2 3 4 5}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Vector / Scalar

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;e.g. {vec / {1 2 3 4} 2.} -&gt; {0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Vector + Vector

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;e.g. {vec + {1 2 3} {4 5 6}} -&gt; {5 7 9}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Matrix * Scalar

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;e.g. {vec * {{1 2 3} {4 5 6}} 2} -&gt; {{2 4 6} {8 10 12}}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Multiplying a 3x3 matrix with another:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;e.g. {vec * {{1 2 3} {4 5 6} {7 8 9}} {{1 0 0} {0 1 0} {0 0 1}}} -&gt; \
 {{1 0 0} {0 5 0} {0 0 9}}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The dot product of two vectors is a scalar. That's easily had too, given a sum function:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc sum list {expr [join $list +]+0}
sum [vec * {1 2} {3 4}]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
should result in 11 (= (1*3)+(2*4)).

Here's a little application for this: a vector factorizer, that produces the list of divisors for a given integer. For this we again need a 1-based integer range generator:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc iota1 x {
    set res {}
    for {set i 1} {$i&lt;=$x} {incr i} {lappend res $i}
    set res
}
e.g. {iota1 7}           -&gt; {1 2 3 4 5 6 7}

#-- We can compute the modulo of a number by its index vector:
e.g. {vec % 7 [iota1 7]} -&gt; {0 1 1 3 2 1 0}

#-- and turn all elements where the remainder is 0 to 1, else 0:
e.g. {vec == 0 [vec % 7 [iota1 7]]} -&gt; {1 0 0 0 0 0 1}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
At this point, a number is prime if the sum of the latest vector is 2. But we can also multiply out the 1s with the divisors from the i ndex vector:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;e.g. {vec * [iota1 7] [vec == 0 [vec % 7 [iota1 7]]]} -&gt; {1 0 0 0 0 0 7}

#-- Hence, 7 is only divisible by 1 and itself, hence it is a prime.
e.g. {vec * [iota1 6] [vec == 0 [vec % 6 [iota1 6]]]} -&gt; {1 2 3 0 0 6}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
So 6 is divisible by 2 and 3; non-zero elements in (lrange $divisors 1 end-1) gives the &quot;proper&quot; divisors. And three nested calls to vec are sufficient to produce the divisors list :)

Just for comparison, here's how it looks in J:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;   iota1=.&gt;:@i.
   iota1 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   f3=.iota1*(0&amp;=@|~iota1)
   f3 7
1 0 0 0 0 0 7
   f3 6
1 2 3 0 0 6
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Integers as Boolean functions ===

Boolean functions, in which arguments and result are in the domain {true, false}, or {1, 0} as expr has it, and operators are e.g. {AND, OR, NOT} resp. {&amp;&amp;, ||, !}, can be represented by their truth table, which for example for {$a &amp;&amp; $b} looks like:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;a b  a&amp;&amp;b
0 0  0
1 0  0
0 1  0
1 1  1
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As all but the last column just enumerate all possible combinations of the arguments, first column least-significant, the full representation of a&amp;&amp;b is the last column, a sequence of 0s and 1s which can be seen as binary integer, reading from bottom up: &lt;code&gt;1 0 0 0 == 8&lt;/code&gt;. So 8 is the associated integer of &lt;code&gt;a&amp;&amp;b&lt;/code&gt;, but not only of this &amp;mdash; we get the same integer for &lt;code&gt;!(!a || !b)&lt;/code&gt;, but then again, these functions are equivalent.

To try this in Tcl, here's a truth table generator that I borrowed from a little proving engine, but without the lsort used there &amp;mdash; the order of cases delivered makes best sense when the first bit is least significant: }

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc truthtable n {
   # make a list of 2**n lists, each with n truth values 0|1
   set res {}
   for {set i 0} {$i &lt; (1&lt;&lt;$n)} {incr i} {
       set case {}
       for {set j  0} {$j &lt;$n} {incr j } {
           lappend case [expr {($i &amp; (1&lt;&lt;$j)) != 0}]
       }
       lappend res $case
   }
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now we can write n(f), which, given a Boolean function of one or more arguments, returns its characteristic number, by iterating over all cases in the truth table, and setting a bit where appropriate:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc n(f) expression {
   set vars [lsort -unique [regsub -all {[^a-zA-Z]} $expression &quot; &quot;]]
   set res 0
   set bit 1
   foreach case [truthtable [llength $vars]] {
       foreach $vars $case break
       set res [expr $res | ((($expression)!=0)*$bit)]
       incr bit $bit ;#-- &lt;&lt;1, or *2
   }
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Experimenting:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% n(f) {$a &amp;&amp; !$a} ;#-- contradiction is always false
0
% n(f) {$a || !$a} ;#-- tautology is always true
3
% n(f) {$a}        ;#-- identity is boring
2
% n(f) {!$a}       ;#-- NOT
1
% n(f) {$a &amp;&amp; $b}  ;#-- AND
8
% n(f) {$a || $b}  ;#-- OR
14
% n(f) {!($a &amp;&amp; $b)} ;#-- de Morgan's laws:
7
% n(f) {!$a || !$b}  ;#-- same value = equivalent
7
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So the characteristic integer is not the same as the Goedel number of a function, which would encode the structure of operators used there.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% n(f) {!($a || $b)} ;#-- interesting: same as unary NOT
1
% n(f) {!$a &amp;&amp; !$b}
1
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Getting more daring, let's try a distributive law:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% n(f) {$p &amp;&amp; ($q || $r)}
168
% n(f) {($p &amp;&amp; $q) || ($p &amp;&amp; $r)}
168
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Daring more: what if we postulate the equivalence?

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% n(f) {(($p &amp;&amp; $q) || ($p &amp;&amp; $r)) == ($p &amp;&amp; ($q || $r))}
255
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Without proof, I just claim that every function of n arguments whose characteristic integer is &lt;code&gt;2^(2^n)&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; 1 is a tautology (or a true statement &amp;mdash; all bits are 1). Conversely, postulating non-equivalence turns out to be false in all cases, hence a contradiction:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% n(f) {(($p &amp;&amp; $q) || ($p &amp;&amp; $r)) != ($p &amp;&amp; ($q || $r))}
0
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So again, we have a little proving engine, and simpler than last time.

In the opposite direction, we can call a Boolean function by its number and provide one or more arguments &amp;mdash; if we give more than the function can make sense of, non-false excess arguments lead to constant falsity, as the integer can be considered zero-extended:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc f(n) {n args} {
   set row 0
   set bit 1
   foreach arg $args {
       set row [expr {$row | ($arg != 0)*$bit}]
       incr bit $bit
   }
   expr !!($n &amp;(1&lt;&lt;$row))
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Trying again, starting at OR (14):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% f(n) 14 0 0
0
% f(n) 14 0 1
1
% f(n) 14 1 0
1
% f(n) 14 1 1
1
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So f(n) 14 indeed behaves like the OR function &amp;mdash; little surprise, as its truth table (the results of the four calls), read bottom-up, 1110, is decimal 14 (8 + 4 + 2). Another test, inequality:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% n(f) {$a != $b}
6
% f(n) 6 0 0
0
% f(n) 6 0 1
1
% f(n) 6 1 0
1
% f(n) 6 1 1
0
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Trying to call 14 (OR) with more than two args:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% f(n) 14 0 0 1
0
% f(n) 14 0 1 1
0
53 % f(n) 14 1 1 1
0
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The constant 0 result is a subtle indication that we did something wrong :)

Implication (if a then b, &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;) can in expr be expressed as &lt;code&gt;$a &lt;= $b&lt;/code&gt; &amp;mdash; just note that the &quot;arrow&quot; seems to point the wrong way. Let's try to prove &quot;Modus Barbara&quot; &amp;mdash; &quot;if a implies b and b implies c, then a implies c&quot;:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% n(f) {(($a &lt;= $b) &amp;&amp; ($b &lt;= $c)) &lt;= ($a &lt;= $c)}
255
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With less abstract variable names, one might as well write

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% n(f) {(($Socrates &lt;= $human) &amp;&amp; ($human &lt;= $mortal)) &lt;= ($Socrates &lt;= $mortal)}
255
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But this has been verified long ago, by Socrates' death :^)

=== Let unknown know ===

To extend Tcl, i.e. to make it understand and do things that before raised an error, the easiest way is to write a proc. Any proc must however be called in compliance with Tcl's fundamental syntax: first word is the command name, then the arguments separated by whitespace. Deeper changes are possible with the unknown command, which is called if a command name is, well, unknown, and in the standard version tries to call executables, to auto-load scripts, or do other helpful things (see the file &lt;code&gt;init.tcl&lt;/code&gt;). One could edit that file (not recommended), or rename unknown to something else and provide one's own unknown handler, that falls through to the original proc if unsuccessful, as shown in Radical language modification.

Here is a simpler way that allows to extend unknown &quot;in place&quot; and incrementally: We let unknown &quot;know&quot; what action it shall take under what conditions. The know command is called with a condition that should result in an integer when given to expr, and a body that will be executed if cond results in nonzero, returning the last result if not terminated with an explicit return. In both cond and body you may use the variable args that holds the problem command unknown was invoked with.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc know what {
   if ![info complete $what] {error &quot;incomplete command(s) $what&quot;}
   proc unknown args $what\n[info body unknown]
} ;# RS
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The extending code ''what'' is prepended to the previous unknown body. This means that subsequent calls to know stack up, last condition being tried first, so if you have several conditions that fire on the same input, let them be &quot;known&quot; from generic to specific. 

Here's a little debugging helper, to find out why &quot;know&quot; conditions don't fire:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc know? {} {puts [string range [info body unknown] 0 511]}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Now testing what new magic this handful of code allows us to do. This simple example invokes expr if the &quot;command&quot; is digestible for it:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% know {if {![catch {expr $args} res]} {return $res}}
% 3+4
7
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== If we had no if ===

Imagine the makers of Tcl had failed to provide the if command. All the rest would be there. Doing more steps towards functional programming, I came upon this interesting problem, and will shortly demonstrate that it can easily be solved in pure-Tcl.

We still have the canonical truth values 0 and 1 as returned from expr with a comparison operator. The idea in the paper I read is to use them as names of very simple functions:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc 0 {then else} {uplevel 1 $else}
proc 1 {then else} {uplevel 1 $then} ;# the famous K combinator
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Glory be to the 11 rules of man Tcl that this is already a crude though sufficient reimplementation:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set x 42
[expr $x&lt;100] {puts Yes} {puts No}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The bracketed expr command is evaluated first, returning 0 or 1 as result of the comparison. This result (0 or 1) is substituted for the first word of this command. The other words (arguments) are not substituted because they're curly-braced, so either 0 or 1 is invoked, and does its simple job. (I used uplevel instead of eval to keep all side effects in caller's scope). Formally, what happened to the bracketed call is that it went through &quot;applicative order&quot; evaluation (i.e., do it now), while the braced commands wait for &quot;normal order&quot; evaluation (i.e., do when needed, maybe never &amp;mdash; the need is expressed through eval/upvar or similar commands).

Though slick at first sight, we actually have to type more. As a second step, we create the If command that wraps the expr invocation:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc If {cond then else} {
   [uplevel 1 [list expr ($cond)!=0]] {uplevel 1 $then} {uplevel 1 $else}
}
If {$x&gt;40} {puts Indeed} {puts &quot;Not at all&quot;}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
This again passes impromptu tests, and adds the feature that any non-zero value counts as true and returns 1 &amp;mdash; if we neglect the other syntactic options of if, especially the elseif chaining. However, this is no fundamental problem &amp;mdash; consider that

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;if A then B elseif C then D else E
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;can be rewritten as

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;if A then B else {if C then D else E}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;so the two-way If is about as mighty as the real thing, give or take a few braces and redundant keywords (then, else).

Luckily we have an if in Tcl (and it certainly fares better in byte-code compilation), but on leisurely evenings it's not the microseconds that count (for me at least) &amp;mdash; it's rather reading on the most surprising (or fundamental) ideas, and demonstrating how easily Tcl can bring them to life...

=== Brute force meets Goedel ===

Never afraid of anything (as long as everything is a string), a discussion in the Tcl chatroom brought me to try the following: let the computer write (&quot;discover&quot;) its own software, only given specifications of input and output. In truly brute force, up to half a million programs are automatically written and (a suitable subset of them) tested to find the one that passes the tests.

To make things easier, this flavor of &quot;software&quot; is in a very simple RPN language similar to, but much smaller than, the one presented in Playing bytecode: stack-oriented like Forth, each operation being one byte (ASCII char) wide, so we don't even need whitespace in between. Arguments are pushed on the stack, and the result of the &quot;software&quot;, the stack at end, is returned. For example, in

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;ebc ++ 1 2 3
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;execution of the script &quot;++&quot; should sum its three arguments (1+(2+3)), and return 6.

Here's the &quot;bytecode engine&quot; (ebc: execute byte code), which retrieves the implementations of bytecodes from the global array cmd:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc ebc {code argl} {
   set ::S $argl
   foreach opcode [split $code &quot;&quot;] {
       eval $::cmd($opcode)
   }
   set ::S
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Let's now populate the bytecode collection. The set of all defined bytecodes will be the alphabet of this little RPN language. It may be interesting to note that this language has truly minimal syntax &amp;mdash; the only rule is: each script (&quot;word&quot;) composed of any number of bytecodes is well-formed. It just remains to check whether it does what we want.

Binary expr operators can be treated generically:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;foreach op {+ - * /} {
   set cmd($op) [string map &quot;@ $op&quot; {swap; push [expr {[pop] @ [pop]}]}]
}

#-- And here's some more hand-crafted bytecode implementations
set cmd(d) {push [lindex $::S end]} ;# dup
set cmd(q) {push [expr {sqrt([pop])}]}
set cmd(^) {push [swap; expr {pow([pop],[pop])}]}
set cmd(s) swap

#-- The stack routines imply a global stack ::S, for simplicity
interp alias {} push {} lappend ::S
proc pop {}  {K [lindex $::S end] [set ::S [lrange $::S 0 end-1]]}
proc K {a b} {set a}
proc swap {} {push [pop] [pop]}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Instead of enumerating all possible bytecode combinations beforehand (which grows exponentially by alphabet and word length), I use this code from Mapping words to integers to step over their sequence, uniquely indexed by an increasing integer. This is something like the Goedel number of the corresponding code. Note that with this mapping, all valid programs (bytecode sequences) correspond to one unique non-negative integer, and longer programs have higher integers associated:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc int2word {int alphabet} {
   set word &quot;&quot;
   set la [llength $alphabet]
   while {$int &gt; 0} {
       incr int -1
       set word  [lindex $alphabet [expr {$int % $la}]]$word
       set int   [expr {$int/$la}]
   }
   set word
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now out for discovery! The toplevel proc takes a paired list of inputs and expected output. It tries in brute force all programs up to the specified maximum Goedel number and returns the first one that complies with all tests:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc discover0 args {
   set alphabet [lsort [array names ::cmd]]
   for {set i 1} {$i&lt;10000} {incr i} {
       set code [int2word $i $alphabet]
       set failed 0
       foreach {inputs output} $args {
           catch {ebc $code $inputs} res
           if {$res != $output} {incr failed; break}
       }
       if {!$failed} {return $code}
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But iterating over many words is still pretty slow, at least on my 200 MHz box, and many useless &quot;programs&quot; are tried. For instance, if the test has two inputs and wants one output, the stack balance is -1 (one less out than in). This is provided e.g. by one the binary operators +-*/. But the program &quot;dd&quot; (which just duplicates the top of stack twice) has a stack balance of +2, and hence can never pass the example test. So, on a morning dogwalk, I thought out this strategy:

* measure the stack balance for each bytecode 
* iterate once over very many possible programs, computing their stack balance 
* partition them (put into distinct subsets) by stack balance 
* perform each 'discovery' call only on programs of matching stack balance

Here's this version. Single bytecodes are executed, only to measure their effect on the stack. The balance of longer programs can be computed by just adding the balances of their individual bytecodes:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc bc'stack'balance bc {
   set stack {1 2} ;# a bytecode will consume at most two elements
   expr {[llength [ebc $bc $stack]]-[llength $stack]}
}
proc stack'balance code {
   set res 0
   foreach bc [split $code &quot;&quot;] {incr res $::balance($bc)}
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The partitioning will run for some seconds (depending on nmax &amp;mdash; I tried with several ten thousand), but it's needed only once. The size of partitions is further reduced by excluding programs which contain redundant code, that will have no effect, like swapping the stack twice, or swapping before an addition or multiplication. A program without such extravaganzas is shorter and yet does the same job, so it will have been tested earlier anyway.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc partition'programs nmax {
   global cmd partitions balance
   #-- make a table of bytecode stack balances
   set alphabet [array names cmd]
   foreach bc $alphabet {
       set balance($bc) [bc'stack'balance $bc]
   }
   array unset partitions ;# for repeated sourcing
   for {set i 1} {$i&lt;=$nmax} {incr i} {
       set program [int2word $i $alphabet]
       #-- &quot;peephole optimizer&quot; - suppress code with redundancies
       set ok 1
       foreach sequence {ss s+ s*} {
           if {[string first $sequence $program]&gt;=0} {set ok 0}
       }
       if {$ok} {
           lappend partitions([stack'balance $program]) $program
       }
   }
   set program ;# see how far we got
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The discoverer, Second Edition, determines the stack balance of the first text, and tests only those programs of the same partition:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc discover args {
   global partitions
   foreach {in out} $args break
   set balance [expr {[llength $out]-[llength $in]}]
   foreach code $partitions($balance) {
       set failed 0
       foreach {input output} $args {
           catch {ebc $code $input} res
           if {$res != $output} {incr failed; break}
       }
       if {!$failed} {return $code}
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But now for the trying. The partitioning helps very much in reducing the number of candidates. For the 1000 programs with Goedel numbers 1..1000, it retains only a fraction for each stack balance:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;-2: 75 
-1: 155 (this and 0 will be the most frequently used) 
0: 241 
1: 274 
2: 155 
3: 100
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Simple starter &amp;mdash; discover the successor function (add one):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% discover 5 6  7 8
dd/+
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Not bad: duplicate the number twice, divide by itself to get the constant 1, and add that to the original number. However, it fails to work if we add the successor of 0 as another test case:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% discover 5 6  7 8  0 1
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Nothing coming &amp;mdash; because zero division made the last test fail. If we give only this test, another solution is found:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% discover 0 1
d^
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;Take x to the x-th&quot; power&quot; &amp;mdash; &lt;code&gt;pow(0,0)&lt;/code&gt; gives indeed 1, but that's not the generic successor function.

More experiments to discover the hypot() function:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% discover {4 3} 5
d/+
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hm &amp;mdash; the 3 is duplicated, divided by itself (=1), which is added to 4. Try to swap the inputs:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% discover {3 4} 5
q+
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Another dirty trick: get square root of 4, add to 3 &amp;mdash; presto, 5. The correct &lt;code&gt;hypot()&lt;/code&gt; function would be

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;d*sd*+q
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;but my program set (nmax=30000) ends at 5-byte codes, so even by giving another test to force discovery of the real thing, it would never reach a 7-byte code. OK, I bite the bullet, set nmax to 500000, wait 5 minutes for the partitioning, and then:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% discover {3 4} 5  {11 60}  61
sd/+
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Hm.. cheap trick again &amp;mdash; it was discovered that the solution is just the successor of the second argument. Like in real life, test cases have to be carefully chosen. So I tried with another a^2+b^2=c^2 set, and HEUREKA! (after 286 seconds):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% discover {3 4} 5  {8 15} 17
d*sd*+q
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After partitioning, 54005 programs had the -1 stack balance, and the correct result was on position 48393 in that list...

And finally, with the half-million set of programs, here's a solution for the successor function too:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% discover  0 1  4711 4712
ddd-^+
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;d-&quot; subtracts top of stack from itself, pushing 0; the second duplicate to the 0-th power gives 1, which is added to the original argument. After some head-scratching, I find it plausible, and possibly it is even the simplest possible solution, given the poorness of this RPN language.

Lessons learned:

* Brute force is simple, but may demand very much patience (or faster hardware) 
* The sky, not the skull is the limit what all we can do with Tcl :)

=== Object orientation ===
OO (Object Orientation) is a style in programming languages popular since Smalltalk, and especially C++, Java, etc. For Tcl, there have been several OO extensions/frameworks (''incr Tcl'', ''XOTcl'', ''stooop'', ''Snit'' to name a few) in different flavors, but none can be considered as standard followed by a majority of users. However, most of these share the features
* classes can be defined, with variables and methods
* objects are created as instances of a class
* objects are called with messages to perform a method
Of course, there are some who say: &quot;Advocating object-orientated programming is like advocating pants-oriented clothing: it covers your behind, but often doesn't fit best&quot; ...

==== Bare-bones OO ====
Quite a bunch of what is called OO can be done in pure Tcl without a &quot;framework&quot;, only that the code might look clumsy and distracting. Just choose how to implement instance variables:

* in global variables or namespaces 
* or just as parts of a transparent value, with TOOT

The task of frameworks, be they written in Tcl or C, is just to hide away gorey details of the implementation &amp;mdash; in other words, sugar it :) On the other hand, one understands a clockwork best when it's outside the clock, and all parts are visible &amp;mdash; so to get a good understanding of OO, it might be most instructive to look at a simple implementation. 

As an example, here's a Stack class with ''push'' and ''pop'' methods, and an instance variable ''s'' &amp;mdash; a list that holds the stack's contents:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;namespace eval Stack {set n 0}

proc Stack::Stack {} { #-- constructor
  variable n
  set instance [namespace current]::[incr n]
  namespace eval $instance {variable s {}}
  interp alias {} $instance {} ::Stack::do $instance
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The ''interp alias'' makes sure that calling the object's name, like
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;::Stack::1 push hello
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;is understood and rerouted as a call to the dispatcher below:
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;::Stack::do ::Stack::1 push hello
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The dispatcher imports the object's variables (only ''s'' here) into local scope, and then switches on the method name:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc Stack::do {self method args} { #-- Dispatcher with methods
  upvar #0 ${self}::s s
  switch -- $method {
      push {eval lappend s $args}
      pop  {
          if ![llength $s] {error &quot;stack underflow&quot;}
          K [lindex $s end] [set s [lrange $s 0 end-1]]
      }
      default {error &quot;unknown method $method&quot;}
  }
}
proc K {a b} {set a}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
A framework would just have to make sure that the above code is functionally equivalent to, e.g. (in a fantasy OO style):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;class Stack {
   variable s {}
   method push args {eval lappend s $args}
   method pop {} {
          if ![llength $s] {error &quot;stack underflow&quot;}
          K [lindex $s end] [set s [lrange $s 0 end-1]]
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;which, I admit, reads definitely better. But bare-bones has its advantages too: in order to see how a clockwork works, you'd better have all parts visible :)

Now testing in an interactive tclsh:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% set s [Stack::Stack] ;#-- constructor
::Stack::1             ;#-- returns the generated instance name

% $s push hello
hello
% $s push world
hello world

% $s pop
world
% $s pop
hello
% $s pop
stack underflow       ;#-- clear enough error message

% namespace delete $s ;#-- &quot;destructor&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
==== TOOT: transparent OO for Tcl ====

Transparent OO for Tcl, or TOOT for short, is a very amazing combination of Tcl's concept of transparent values, and the power of OO concepts. In TOOT, the values of objects are represented as a list of length 3: the class name (so much for &quot;runtime type information&quot; :-), a &quot;|&quot; as separator and indicator, and the values of the object, e.g.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;{class | {values of the object}}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Here's my little take on toot in a nutshell. Classes in C++ started out as structs, so I take a minimal struct as example, with generic get and set methods. We will export the ''get'' and ''set'' methods:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;namespace eval toot {namespace export get set}

proc toot::struct {name members} {
   namespace eval $name {namespace import -force ::toot::*}
   #-- membership information is kept in an alias:
   interp alias {} ${name}::@ {} lsearch $members
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The two generic accessor functions will be inherited by &quot;struct&quot;s

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc toot::get {class value member} {
   lindex $value [${class}::@ $member]
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The set method does not change the instance (it couldn't, as it sees it only &quot;by value&quot;) &amp;mdash; it just returns the new composite toot object, for the caller to do with it what he wants:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc toot::set {class value member newval} {
   ::set pos [${class}::@ $member]
   list $class | [lreplace $value $pos $pos $newval]
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
For the whole thing to work, here's a simple overloading of unknown &amp;mdash; see &quot;Let unknown know&quot;. It augments the current unknown code, at the top, with a handler for

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;{class | values} method args
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
patterns, which converts it to the form

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;::toot::(class)::(method) (class) (values) (args)
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
and returns the result of calling that form:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc know what {proc unknown args $what\n[info body unknown]}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now to use it (I admit the code is no easy reading):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;know {
   set first [lindex $args 0]
   if {[llength $first]==3 &amp;&amp; [lindex $first 1] eq &quot;|&quot;} {
       set class [lindex $first 0]
       return [eval ::toot::${class}::[lindex $args 1] \
           $class [list [lindex $first 2]] [lrange $args 2 end]]
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Testing: we define a &quot;struct&quot; named foo, with two obvious members:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;toot::struct foo {bar grill}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Create an instance as pure string value:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set x {foo | {hello world}}
puts [$x get bar] ;# -&gt; hello (value of the &quot;bar&quot; member)
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Modify part of the foo, and assign it to another variale:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set y [$x set grill again]
puts $y ;# -&gt; foo | {hello again}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Struct-specific methods can be just procs in the right namespace. The first and second arguments are the class (disregarded here, as the dash shows) and the value, the rest is up to the coder. This silly example demonstrates member access and some string manipulation: 

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc toot::foo::upcase {- values which string} {
   string toupper [lindex $values [@ $which]]$string
}

puts [$y upcase grill !] ;# -&gt; AGAIN!
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== A little deterministic Turing machine ===

At university, I never learned much about Turing machines. Only decades later, a hint in the Tcl chatroom pointed me to http://csc.smsu.edu/~shade/333/project.txt , an assignment to implement a Deterministic Turing Machine (i.e. one with at most one rule per state and input character), which gives clear instructions and two test cases for input and output, so I decided to try my hand in Tcl.

Rules in this little challenge are of the form a bcD e, where

* a is the state in which they can be applied 
* b is the character that must be read from tape if this rule is to apply 
* c is the character to write to the tape 
* D is the direction to move the tape after writing (R(ight) or L(eft)) 
* e is the state to transition to after the rule was applied

Here's my naive implementation, which takes the tape just as the string it initially is. I only had to take care that when moving beyond its ends, I had to attach a space (written as _) on that end, and adjust the position pointer when at the beginning. Rules are also taken as strings, whose parts can easily be extracted with string index &amp;mdash; as it's used so often here, I alias it to @. }

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc dtm {rules tape} {
   set state 1
   set pos 0
   while 1 {
       set char [@ $tape $pos]
       foreach rule $rules {
           if {[@ $rule 0] eq $state &amp;&amp; [@ $rule 2] eq $char} {
               #puts rule:$rule,tape:$tape,pos:$pos,char:$char
               #-- Rewrite tape at head position.
               set tape [string replace $tape $pos $pos [@ $rule 3]]
               #-- Move tape Left or Right as specified in rule.
               incr pos [expr {[@ $rule 4] eq &quot;L&quot;? -1: 1}]
               if {$pos == -1} {
                   set pos 0
                   set tape _$tape
               } elseif {$pos == [string length $tape]} {
                   append tape _
               }
               set state [@ $rule 6]
               break
           }
       }
       if {$state == 0} break
   }
   #-- Highlight the head position on the tape.
   string trim [string replace $tape $pos $pos \[[@ $tape $pos]\]] _
}

interp alias {} @ {} string index
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Test data from http://csc.smsu.edu/~shade/333/project.txt

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;set rules {
   {1 00R 1}
   {2 01L 0}
   {1 __L 2}
   {2 10L 2}
   {2 _1L 0}
   {1 11R 1}
}
set tapes {
   0
   10011
   1111
}
set rules2 {
   {3 _1L 2}
   {1 _1R 2}
   {1 11L 3}
   {2 11R 2}
   {3 11R 0}
   {2 _1L 1}
}
set tapes2 _
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Testing:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;foreach tape $tapes {puts [dtm $rules $tape]}
puts *
puts [dtm $rules2 $tapes2]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
reports the results as wanted in the paper, on stdout:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;&gt;tclsh turing.tcl
[_]1
1[0]100
[_]10000
*
1111[1]1
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== Streams ===

Streams are a powerful concept in (not only functional) programming. In SICP chapter 3.5, streams are introduced as data structures characterized as &quot;delayed lists&quot;, whose elements are produced and returned only on demand (deferred evaluation). This way, a stream can promise to be a potentially endless source of data, while taking only finite time to process and deliver what's really wanted. Other streams may provide a finite but very large number of elements, which would be impractical to process in one go. In Tcl, the two ways of reading a file are a good example:

* read &lt;code&gt;$fp&lt;/code&gt; returns the whole contents, which then can be processed; 
* while &lt;code&gt;{[gets $fp line]&gt;-1} {...}&lt;/code&gt; reads line by line, interleaved with processing

The second construct may be less efficient, but is robust for gigabyte-sized files. A simpler example is pipes in Unix/DOS (use TYPE for cat there):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;cat foo.bar | more&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
where the &quot;cat&quot; delivers lines of the file as long as &quot;more&quot; will take them, and waits otherwise (after all, stdin and stdout are just streams...). Such process chains can be emulated in Tcl with the following rules:

A stream is modelled here as a procedure that returns one stream item on each call. The special item &quot;&quot; (the empty string) indicates that the stream is exhausted. Streams are interesting if they don't deliver the same result on every call, which requires them to maintain state between calls e.g. in static variables (here implemented with the fancy remember proc) &amp;mdash; examples are intgen that delivers ever increasing integers, or gets &lt;code&gt;$fp&lt;/code&gt; where the file pointer advances at each call, so potentially all lines of the file are returned over time.

A filter takes one or more streams, and possibly other arguments, and reacts like a stream too. Hence, streams can be (and typically are) nested for processing purposes. If a filter meets end-of-stream, it should return that too. Filters may be characterized as &quot;selectors&quot; (who may return only part of their input, like &quot;grep&quot;) and/or &quot;appliers&quot; who call a command on their input and return the result. Note that on infinite streams, selectors may never return, e.g. if you want the second even prime... Streams in general should not be written in brackets (then the Tcl parser would eagerly evaluate them before evaluating the command), but braced, and stream consumers eval the stream at their discretion.

Before we start, a word of warning: maintaining state of a procedure is done with default arguments that may be rewritten. To prevent bugs from procedures whose defaults have changed, I've come up with the following simple architecture &amp;mdash; procs with static variables are registered as &quot;sproc&quot;s, which remembers the initial defaults, and with a reset command you can restore the initial values for one or all sprocs:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc sproc {name head body} {
   set ::sproc($name) $head
   proc $name $head $body
}

proc reset { {what *}} {
   foreach name [array names ::sproc $what] {
       proc $name $::sproc($name) [info body $name]
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Now let's start with a simple stream source, &quot;cat&quot;, which as a wrapper for gets returns the lines of a file one by one until exhausted (EOF), in which case an empty string is returned (this requires that empty lines in the files, which would look similarly, are represented as a single blank):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;sproc cat {filename {fp {}} } {
   if {$fp==&quot;&quot;} {
       remember fp [set fp [open $filename]]
   }
   if {[gets $fp res]&lt;0} {
       remember fp [close $fp] ;# which returns an empty string ;-)
   } elseif {$res==&quot;&quot;} {set res &quot; &quot;} ;# not end of stream!
   set res
}

proc remember {argn value} {
   # - rewrite a proc's default arg with given value
   set procn [lindex [info level -1] 0] ;# caller's name
   set argl {}
   foreach arg [info args $procn] {
       if [info default $procn $arg default] {
           if {$arg==$argn} {set default $value}
           lappend argl [list $arg $default]
       } else {
           lappend argl $arg
       }
   }
   proc $procn $argl [info body $procn]
   set value
}
# This simple but infinite stream source produces all positive integers:
sproc intgen { {seed -1}} {remember seed [incr seed]}

# This produces all (well, very many) powers of 2:
sproc powers-of-2 { {x 0.5}} {remember x [expr $x*2]}

# A filter that reads and displays a stream until user stops it:
proc more {stream} {
   while 1 {
       set res [eval $stream]
       if {$res==&quot;&quot;} break ;# encountered end of stream
       puts -nonewline $res; flush stdout
       if {[gets stdin]==&quot;q&quot;} break
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Usage example:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;more {cat streams.tcl}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;which crudely emulates the Unix/DOS pipe mentioned above (you'll have to hit {{keypress|Enter}} after every line, and {{keypress|q}}{{keypress|Enter}} to quit..). more is the most important &quot;end-user&quot; of streams, especially if they are infinite. Note however that you need stdin for this implementation, which excludes wishes on Windows (one might easily write a UI-more that reacts on mouse clicks, though).

A more generic filter takes a condition and a stream, and on each call returns an element of the input stream where the condition holds &amp;mdash; if ever one comes along:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc filter {cond stream} {
   while 1 {
       set res [eval $stream]
       if {$res==&quot;&quot; || [$cond $res]} break
   }
   set res
}

# Here is a sample usage with famous name:
proc grep {re stream} {
   filter [lambda [list x [list re $re]] {regexp $re $x}] $stream
}

#.... which uses the (less) famous function maker:
proc lambda {args body} {
   set name [info level 0]
   proc $name $args $body
   set name
}
# Usage example: more {grep this {cat streams.tcl}}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Friends of syntactic sugar might prefer shell style:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;$ cat streams.tcl | grep this | more
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and guess what, we can have that in Tcl too (and not in Scheme !-), by writing a proc, that also resets all sprocs, with the fancy name &quot;$&quot; (in Unix, this could be the shell prompt that you don't type, but for Tcl we always have to have the command name as first word):

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc $ args {
    reset
    set cmd {}
    foreach arg $args {
       if {$arg != &quot;|&quot;} {
           lappend tmp $arg
       } else {
           set cmd [expr {$cmd==&quot;&quot;? $tmp: [lappend tmp $cmd]}]
           set tmp {}
       }
   }
   uplevel 1 [lappend tmp $cmd]
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;To prove that we haven't cheated by using exec, let's introduce a line counter filter:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;sproc -n {stream {n 0}} {
   set res [eval $stream]
   if {$res!=&quot;&quot;} {set res [remember n [incr n]]:$res}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This can be added to filter chains, to count lines in the original file, or only the results from grep:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;$ cat streams.tcl | -n | grep this | more
$ cat streams.tcl | grep this | -n | more
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We further observe that more has a similar structure to filter, so we could also rewrite it in terms of that:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc more2 stream {
   filter [lambda x {
       puts -nonewline $x; flush stdout
       expr {[gets stdin]==&quot;q&quot;}
   }] $stream
}

# Here is another stream producer that returns elements from a list:
sproc streamlist {list {todo {}} {firstTime 1} } {
   if $firstTime {set todo $list; remember firstTime 0}
   remember todo [lrange $todo 1 end]
   lindex $todo 0
}

# This one repeats its list endlessly, so better use it with 'more':
sproc infinite-streamlist {list {todo {}} } {
   initially todo $list
   remember  todo [lrange $todo 1 end]
   lindex   $todo 0
}

# This is sugar for first-time assignment of static variables:
proc initially {varName value} {
   upvar 1 $varName var
   if {$var==&quot;&quot;} {set var $value}
}

# But for a simple constant stream source, just use [subst]:
# more {subst 1} ;# will produce as many ones as you wish

# This filter collects its input (should be finite ;-) into a list:
proc collect stream {
   set res {}
   while 1 {
       set element [eval $stream]
       if {$element==&quot;&quot;} break
       lappend res $element
   }
   set res
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The sort filter is unusual in that it consumes its whole (finite!) input, sorts it, and acts as a stream source on the output:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;sproc sort {stream {todo {}} {firstTime 1}} {
   if $firstTime {
       set todo [lsort [collect $stream]]
       remember firstTime 0
   }
   remember todo [lrange $todo 1 end]
   lindex $todo 0
}
# $ streamlist {foo bar grill a} | sort | collect =&gt; a bar foo grill

proc apply {f stream} {$f [eval $stream]}

#... This can be plugged into a filter chain to see what's going on:
proc observe stream {apply [lambda y {puts $y; set y}] $stream}

# ... or, to get a stream of even numbers, starting from 0:
more {apply [lambda x {expr $x*2}] intgen}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Now for the example in SICP: find the second prime in the interval between 10000 and 1000000.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;sproc interval {from to {current {}} } {
   initially current $from
   if {$current&lt;=$to} {
       remember current [expr $current+1]
   }
}
proc prime? x {
   if {$x&lt;2} {return 0}
   set max [expr sqrt($x)]
   set try 2
   while {$try&lt;=$max} {
       if {$x%$try == 0} {return 0}
       incr try [expr {2-($try==2)}]
   }
   return 1
}
proc stream-index {stream index} {
   for {set i 0} {$i&lt;=$index} {incr i} {
       set res [eval $stream]
   }
   set res
}
sproc stream-range {stream from to {pos 0}} {
   while {$pos&lt;$from} {
       set res [eval $stream] ;# ignore elements before 'from'
       if {$res==&quot;&quot;} return   ;# might be end-of-stream
       incr pos
   }
   if {$to!=&quot;end&quot; &amp;&amp; $pos &gt; $to} return
   remember pos [incr pos]
   eval $stream
}

stream-index {filter prime? {interval 10000 1000000}} 1 ==&gt; 10009
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Another idea from SICP is a &quot;smoothing&quot; function, that averages each pair of values from the input stream. For this we need to introduce a short-term memory also in the filter:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;sproc average {stream {previous {}} } {
   if {$previous==&quot;&quot;} {set previous [eval $stream]}
   remember previous [set current [eval $stream]]
   if {$current!=&quot;&quot;} {expr {($previous+$current)/2.}}
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;which, tested on a n-element stream, returns n-1 averages:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;collect {average {streamlist {1 2 3 4 5}}} ==&gt; 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Yet another challenge was to produce an infinite stream of pairs &lt;code&gt;{i j}&lt;/code&gt; of positive integers, &lt;code&gt;i &lt;= j&lt;/code&gt;, ordered by their sum, so that more pairs produces consecutively

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;{1 1} {1 2} {1 3} {2 2} {1 4} {2 3} {1 5} {2 4} {3 3} {1 6} ...
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here's my solution which does that:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;sproc pairs { {last {}} } {
   if {$last==&quot;&quot;} {
       set last [list 1 1] ;# start of iteration
   } else {
       foreach {a b} $last break
       if {$a &gt;= $b-1} {
           set last [list 1 [expr {$a+$b}]] ;# next sum level
       } else {
           set last [list [incr a] [incr b -1]]
       }
   }
   remember last $last
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
'''Ramanujan numbers''': The pairs generator can be used to find Ramanujan numbers, which can be represented as the sum of two integer cubes in more than one way. Here I use a global array for recording results:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;sproc Ramanujan {stream {firstTime 1}} {
   if $firstTime {unset ::A; remember firstTime 0}
   while 1 {
       set pair [eval $stream]
       foreach {a b} $pair break
       set n [expr {$a*$a*$a + $b*$b*$b}]
       if [info exists ::A($n)] {
           lappend ::A($n) $pair
           break
       } else {set ::A($n) [list $pair]}
   }
   list $n $::A($n)
}

more {Ramanujan pairs} ;# or: $ pairs | Ramanujan | more
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;delivers in hardly noticeable time the R. numbers 1729, 4104, 13832... Or, how's this infinite Fibonacchi number generator, which on more fibo produces all the F.numbers (0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...) you might want?

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;sproc fibo { {a &quot;&quot;} {b &quot;&quot;}} {
   if {$a==&quot;&quot;} {
       remember a 0
   } elseif {$b==&quot;&quot;} {
       remember b 1
   } else {
       if {$b &gt; 1&lt;&lt;30} {set b [expr double($b)]}
       remember a $b
       remember b [expr $a+$b]
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
'''Discussion''': With the above code, it was possible to reproduce quite some behavior of streams as documented in SICP, not as data structures but with Tcl procs (though procs are data too, in some sense...). What's missing is the capability to randomly address parts of a stream, as is possible in Scheme (and of course their claim to do without assignment, or mutable data...) Tcl lists just don't follow LISP's CAR/CDR model (though KBK demonstrated in Tcl and LISP that this structure can be emulated, also with procs), but rather C's flat &lt;code&gt;*TclObject[]&lt;/code&gt; style. The absence of lexical scoping also led to constructs like sproc/reset, which stop a gap but aren't exactly elegant &amp;mdash; but Tcl's clear line between either local or global variables allows something like closures only by rewriting default arguments like done in remember (or like in Python).

Don't take this as a fundamental critique of Tcl, though &amp;mdash; its underlying model is far more simple and elegant than LISP's (what with &quot;special forms&quot;, &quot;reader macros&quot;...), and yet powerful enough to do just about everything possible...

=== Playing with Laws of Form ===

After many years, I re-read

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;G. Spencer-Brown, &quot;Laws of Form&quot;. New York: E.P. Dutton 1979
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
which is sort of a mathematical thriller, if you will. Bertrand Russell commented that the author &quot;has revealed a new calculus, of great power and simplicity&quot; (somehow sounds like Tcl ;^). In a very radical simplification, a whole world is built up by two operators, juxtaposition without visible symbol (which could be likened to or) and a overbar-hook (with the meaning of not) that I can't type here &amp;mdash; it's a horizontal stroke over zero or more operands, continued at right by a vertical stroke going down to the baseline. In these Tcl experiments, I use &quot;&quot; for &quot;&quot; and angle-brackets &lt;&gt; for the overbar-hook (with zero or more operands in between).

One point that was new for me is that the distinction between operators and operands is not cast in stone. Especially constants (like &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; in Boolean algebras) can be equally well expressed as neutral elements of operators, if these are considered variadic, and having zero arguments. This makes sense, even in Tcl, where one might implement them as

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc and args {
   foreach arg $args {if {![uplevel 1 expr $arg]} {return 0}}
   return 1
}

proc or args {
   foreach arg $args {if {[uplevel 1 expr $arg]} {return 1}}
   return 0
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
which, when called with no arguments, return 1 or 0, respectively. So [or] == 0 and [and] == 1. In Spencer-Brown's terms, [] (which is &quot;&quot;, the empty string with no arguments) is false (&quot;nil&quot; in LISP), and [&lt;&gt;] is the negation of &quot;&quot;, i.e. true. His two axioms are:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; == &lt;&gt; &quot;to recall is to call       -- (1 || 1) == 1&quot;
&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; ==    &quot;to recross is not to cross -- !!0 == 0&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
and these can be implemented by a string map that is repeated as long as it makes any difference (sort of a trampoline) to simplify any expression consisting only of operators and constants (which are operators with zero arguments): 

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc lf'simplify expression {
   while 1 {
       set res [string map {&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;} $expression]
       if {$res eq $expression} {return $res}
       set expression $res
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Testing:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% lf'simplify &lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&gt;
&lt;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;which maps &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; to &lt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; to &quot;&quot;, and returns &lt;&gt; for &quot;true&quot;.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% lf'simplify &lt;a&gt;a
&lt;a&gt;a
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In the algebra introduced here, with a variable &quot;a&quot;, no further simplification was so far possible. Let's change that &amp;mdash; &quot;a&quot; can have only two values, &lt;code&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so we might try to solve the expression by assuming all possible values for a, and see if they differ. If they don't, we have found a fact that isn't dependent on the variable's value, and the resulting constant is returned, otherwise the unsolved expression:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc lf'solve {expression var} {
   set results {}
   foreach value {&quot;&quot; &lt;&gt;} {
       set res [lf'simplify [string map [list $var $value] $expression]]
       if {![in $results $res]} {lappend results $res}
       if {[llength $results] &gt; 1} {return $expression}
   }
   set results
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;with a helper function in that reports containment of an element in a list:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc in {list element} {expr {[lsearch -exact $list $element] &gt;= 0}}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Testing:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% lf'solve &lt;a&gt;a a
&lt;&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;which means, in expr terms, {(!$a || $a) == 1}, for all values of a. In other words, a tautology. All of Boole's algebra can be expressed in this calculus:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;* (1) not a       == !$a       == &lt;a&gt;
* (2) a or b      == $a || $b  == ab
* (3) a and b     == $a &amp;&amp; $b  == &lt;&lt;a&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&gt;
* (4) a implies b == $a &lt;= $b  == &lt;a&gt;b
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We can test it with the classic &quot;ex contradictione quodlibet&quot; (ECQ) example &amp;mdash; &quot;if p and not p, then q&quot; for any q:

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;% lf'solve &lt;&amp;lt;p&gt;&lt;&amp;lt;p&gt;&gt;&gt;q p
q
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So formally, q is true, whatever it is :) If this sounds overly theoretic, here's a tricky practical example in puzzle solving, Lewis Carroll's last sorites (pp. 123f.). The task is to conclude something from the following premises:

* The only animals in this house are cats 
* Every animal is suitable for a pet, that loves to gaze at the moon 
* When I detest an animal, I avoid it 
* No animals are carnivorous, unless they prowl at night 
* No cat fail to kill mice 
* No animals ever take to me, except what are in this house 
* Kangaroos are not suitable for pets 
* None but carnivora kill mice 
* I detest animals that do not take to me 
* Animals that prowl at night always love to gaze at the moon

These are encoded to the following one-letter predicates:

; a: avoided by me 
; c: cat 
; d: detested by me 
; h: house, in this 
; k: kill mice 
; m: moon, love to gaze at 
; n: night, prowl at 
; p: pet, suitable for 
; r: (kanga)roo 
; t: take to me 
; v: (carni)vorous
So the problem set can be restated, in Spencer-Brown's terms, as

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;h&gt;c &lt;m&gt;p &lt;d&gt;a &lt;v&gt;n &lt;c&gt;k &lt;t&gt;h &lt;r&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;k&gt;v td &lt;n&gt;m&lt;/pre&gt;

I first don't understand why all premises can be just written in a row, which amounts to implicit &quot;or&quot;, but it seems to work out well. As we've seen that &lt;code&gt;&lt;x&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is true for any &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, we can cancel out such tautologies. For this, we reformat the expression to a list of values of type &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;!x&lt;/code&gt;, that is in turn dumped into a local array for existence checking. And when both &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;!x&lt;/code&gt; exist, they are removed from the expression: 
&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;proc lf'cancel expression {
   set e2 [string map {&quot;&lt; &quot; ! &quot;&gt; &quot; &quot;&quot;} [split $expression &quot;&quot;]]
   foreach term $e2 {if {$term ne &quot;&quot;} {set a($term) &quot;&quot;}}
   foreach var [array names a ?] {
       if [info exists a(!$var)] {
           set expression [string map [list &lt;$var&gt; &quot;&quot; $var &quot;&quot;] $expression]
       }
   }
   set expression
}

puts [lf'cancel {&lt;h&gt;c &lt;m&gt;p &lt;d&gt;a &lt;v&gt;n &lt;c&gt;k &lt;t&gt;h &lt;r&gt;&amp;lt;p&gt; &lt;k&gt;v td &lt;n&gt;m}]
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
which results in:

* a   &lt;r&gt;
translated back: &quot;I avoid it, or it's not a kangaroo&quot;, or, reordered, &quot;&lt;r&gt; a&quot; which by (4) means, &quot;All kangaroos are avoided by me&quot;.

=== A little IRC chat bot ===

Here is a simple example of a &quot;chat bot&quot; &amp;mdash; a program that listens on an IRC chatroom, and sometimes also says something, according to its programming. The following script
* connects to channel #tcl on IRC 
* listens to what is said 
* if someone mentions its name (minibot), tries to parse the message and answer.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0;padding-top:0.5em;padding-bottom:0.5em&quot;&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/env tclsh
set ::server irc.freenode.org
set ::chan   #tcl
set ::me     minibot
proc recv {} {
    gets $::fd line
    puts $line
    # handle PING messages from server
    if {[lindex [split $line] 0] eq &quot;PING&quot;} {
       send &quot;PONG [info hostname] [lindex [split $line] 1]&quot;; return
    }
    if {[regexp {:([^!]*)![^ ].* +PRIVMSG ([^ :]+) +(.*[Mm]inibot)(.+)} $line -&gt; \
        nick target msg cmd]} {
           if {$nick eq &quot;ijchain&quot;} {regexp {&lt;([^&gt;]+)&gt;(.+)} $msg -&gt; nick msg}
           set hit 0
           foreach pattern [array names ::patterns] {
               if [string match &quot;*$pattern*&quot; $cmd] {
                   set cmd [string trim $cmd {.,:? }]
                   if [catch {mini eval $::patterns($pattern) $cmd} res] {
                       set res $::errorInfo
                   }
                   foreach line [split $res \n] {
                       send &quot;PRIVMSG $::chan :$line&quot;
                   }
                   incr hit
                   break
               }
           }
           if !$hit {send &quot;PRIVMSG $::chan :Sorry, no idea.&quot;}
    }
}

&quot;Everything is a string&quot;, the Tcl mantra goes. A string is a (finite-length) sequence of characters. Now, what is a character? A character is not the same as a glyph, the writing element that we see on screen or paper - that represents it, but the same glyph can stand for different characters, or the same character be represented with different glyphs (think e.g. of a font selector).

Also, a character is not the same as a byte, or sequence of bytes, in memory. That again may represent a character, but not unequivocally, once we leave the safe haven of ASCII.

Let's try the following working definition: &quot;A character is the abstract concept of a small writing unit&quot;. This often amounts to a letter, digit, or punctuation sign - but a character can be more or less than that. More: Ligatures, groups of two or more letters, can at times be treated as one character (arranged even in more than one line, as seen in Japanese U+337F ㍿ or Arabic U+FDFA ﷺ). Less: little marks (diacritics) added to a character, like the two dots on ü in Nürnberg (U+00FC), can turn that into a new &quot;precomposed&quot; character, as in German; or they may be treated as a separate, &quot;composing character&quot; (U+0308 in the example) which in rendering is added to the preceding glyph (u, U+0075) without advancing the rendering position - a more sensible treatment of the function of these two dots, &quot;trema&quot;, in Spanish, Dutch, or even (older) English orthography: consider the spelling &quot;coöperation&quot; in use before c. 1950. Such composition is the software equivalent of &quot;dead keys&quot; on a typewriter.

Although an abstract concept, a character may of course have attributes, most importantly a name: a string, of course, which describes its function, usage, pronunciation etc. Various sets of names have been formalized in Postscript (/oumlaut) or HTML (&amp;amp;ouml;). Very important in technical applications is of course the assignment of a number (typically a non-negative integer) to identify a character - this is the essence of encodings, where the numbers are more formally called code points. Other attributes may be predicates like &quot;is upper&quot;, &quot;is lower&quot;, &quot;is digit&quot;.

The relations between the three domains are not too complicated: an encoding controls how a 1..n sequence of bytes is interpreted as a character, or vice versa; the act of rendering turns an abstract character into a glyph (typically by a pixel or vector pattern). Conversely, making sense of a set of pixels to correctly represent a sequence of characters, is the much more difficult art of OCR, which will not be covered here.

=== Pre-Unicode encodings ===

Work on encodings, mapping characters to numbers (code points), has a longer history than electronic computing. Francis Bacon (1561-1626) is reported to have used, around 1580, a five-bit encoding where bits were represented as &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;, of the English/Latin alphabet (without the letters j and u!), long before Leibniz discussed binary arithmetics in 1679. An early encoding in practical use was the 5-bit Baudot/CCIT-2 teletype (punch tape) code standardized in 1932, which could represent digits and some punctuations by switching between two modes. I have worked on Univac machines that used six bits per &quot;Fieldata&quot; character, as hardware words were 36 bits long. While IBM used 8 bits in the EBCDIC code, the more famous American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) did basically the same job in 7 bits per character, which was sufficient for upper/lowercase basic Latin (English) as well as digits and a number of punctuations and other &quot;special&quot; characters - as hardware tended to 8-bit bytes as smallest memory unit, one was left for parity checks or other purposes.

The most important purpose, outside the US, was of course to accommodate more letters required to represent the national writing system - Greek, Russian, or the mixed set of accented or &quot;umlauted&quot; characters used in virtually every country in Europe. Even England needed a code point for the Pound Sterling sign. The general solution was to use the 128 additional positions available when ASCII was implemented as 8-bit bytes, hex 80..FF. A whole flock of such encodings were defined and used:

* ISO standard encodings iso8859-.. (1-15)
* MS/DOS code pages cp...
* Macintosh code pages mac...
* Windows code pages cp1...

=== East Asian encodings ===
The East Asian countries China, Japan, and Korea all use character sets numbering in the thousands, so the &quot;high ASCII&quot; approach was not feasible there. Instead, the ASCII concept was extended to a 2x7 bit pattern, where the 94 printing ASCII characters indicate row and column in a 94x94 matrix. This way, all character codes were in practice two bytes wide, and thousands of Hanzi/Kanji/Hangul could be accommodated, plus hundreds of others (ASCII, Greek, Russian alphabets, many graphic characters). These national multibyte encodings are:

* JIS C-6226 (Japan 1978)
* GB 2312-80 (China 1980)
* KS C-5601 (Korea)

If the 2x7 pattern was directly implemented, files in such encodings could not be told apart from ASCII files, except for unreadability. In order to handle both types of strings transparently, the &quot;high ASCII&quot; approach was extended so that a byte in 00..7F was taken at ASCII face value, while bytes with high bit set (80..FF) were interpreted as halves of multibyte codes. For instance, the first Chinese character in GB2312, row 16 col 1 (decimally 1601 for short), gives the two bytes

 16 + 32 + 128 = 176 = 0xB0
  1 + 32 + 128 = 161 = 0xA1
This implementation became known as &quot;Extended UNIX Code&quot; (EUC) in the national flavors euc-cn (China), -jp (Japan), -kr (Korea). Microsoft did it differently and adopted the similar but different ShiftJIS (Japan) resp. &quot;Big 5&quot; (Taiwan, Hongkong) encodings, to add to the &quot;ideograph soup&quot; confusion.

=== Unicode as pivot for all other encodings ===

The Unicode standard is an attempt to unify all modern character encodings into one consistent 16-bit representation. Consider a page with a 16x16 table filled with EuroLatin-1 (ISO 8859-1), the lower half being the ASCII code points. Call that &quot;page 00&quot; and imagine a book of 256 or more such pages (with all kinds of other characters on them, in majority CJK), then you have a pretty clear concept of the Unicode standard, in which a character's code position is &quot;U+&quot; hex (page number*256+cell number), for instance, U+20A4 is the Pound Sterling sign. Initiated by the computer industry (www.unicode.org), the Unicode has grown together with ISO 10646, a parallel standard providing an up-to-31-bits encoding (one left for parity?) with the same scope. Software must allow Unicode strings to be fit for i18n. From Unicode version 3.1, the 16-bit limit was transcended for some rare writing systems, but also for the CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B - apparently, even 65536 code positions are not enough. The total count in Unicode 3.1 is 94,140 encoded characters, of which 70,207 are unified Han ideographs; the next biggest group are over 14000 Korean Hangul. And the number is growing.

Unicode 4.0.0 is the latest version, reported to contain 96,248 Graphic characters, 134 format characters, 65 Control characters, 137,468 &quot;private use&quot;, 2,048 surrogates, 66 noncharacters. 878,083 code points are reserved for what the future will bring. From www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0 : &quot;1,226 new character assignments were made to the Unicode Standard, Version 4.0 (over and above what was in Unicode 3.2). These additions include currency symbols, additional Latin and Cyrillic characters, the Limbu and Tai Le scripts; Yijing Hexagram symbols, Khmer symbols, Linear B syllables and ideograms, Cypriot, Ugaritic, and a new block of variation selectors (especially for future CJK variants).&quot;

=== Unicode implementations: UTF-8, UCS-16 ===

UTF-8 is made to cover 7-bit ASCII, Unicode, and ISO 10646. Characters are represented as sequences of 1..6 eight-bit bytes - termed octets in the character set business - (for ASCII: 1, for Unicode: 2..3) as follows:

* ASCII 0x00..0x7F (Unicode page 0, left half): 0x00..0x7F. Nothing changed. 
* Unicode, pages 00..07: 2 bytes, 110aaabb 10bbbbbb, where aaa are the rightmost bits of page#, bb.. are the bits of the second Unicode byte. These pages cover European/Extended Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic. 
* Unicode, pages 08..FE: 3 bytes, 1110aaaa 10aaaabb 10bbbbbb. These cover all the rest of Unicode, including Hangul, Kanji, and what else. This means that East Asian texts are 50% longer in UTF-8 than in pure 16 bit Unicode. 

ISO 10646 codes beyond Unicode: 4..6 bytes. (Never seen one yet).
General principle of UTF-8 is that the first byte either is a single-byte character (if below 0x80), or indicates the length of a multi-byte code by the number of 1's before the first 0, and is then filled up with data bits. All other bytes start with bits 10 and are then filled up with 6 data bits. It follows from this that bytes in UTF-8 encoding fall in distinct ranges:

   00..7F - plain old ASCII
   80..BF - non-initial bytes of multibyte code
   C2..FD - initial bytes of multibyte code (C0, C1 are not legal!)
   FE, FF - never used (so, free for byte-order marks).

The distinction between initial and non-initial helps in plausibility checks, or to re-synchronize with missing data. Besides, it's independent of byte order (as opposed to UCS-16, see below). Tcl however shields these UTF-8 details from us: characters are just characters, no matter whether 7 bit, 16 bit, or (in the future) more.

I found out by chance that the byte sequence EF BB BF is the UTF-8 equivalent of \uFEFF, and the humble Notepad editor of Windows 2000 indeed switches to UTF-8 encoding when a file starts with these three bytes. I don't know how widely used this convention is, but I like it - my i18n-aware Tcl code will adopt it for reading and writing files, in addition to FEFF treatment that I already do.

The UCS-16 representation (in Tcl just called the &quot;unicode&quot; encoding) is much easier explained: each character code is written as a 16-bit &quot;short&quot; unsigned integer. The practical complication is that the two memory bytes making up a &quot;short&quot; can be arranged in &quot;big-endian&quot; (Motorola, Sparc) or &quot;little-endian&quot; (Intel) byte order. Hence, the following rules were defined for Unicode:

Code point U+FEFF was defined as Byte Order Mark (BOM), later renamed to &quot;Zero-width non-breaking space&quot;; 
code point U+FFFE (as well as FFFF) is not a valid Unicode.
This way, a Unicode-reading application (even Notepad/W2k) can easily detect that something's wrong when it encounters the byte sequence FFFE, and swap the following byte pairs - a minimal and elegant way of dealing with varying byte orders. For XML, a similar self-identification is defined with the encoding attribute in the leading tag.

=== Tcl and encodings ===

From Tcl 8.1, i18n support was brought to string processing, and it was wisely decided to

* use Unicode as general character set 
* use UTF-8 as standard internal encoding 
* provide conversion support for the many other encodings in use.

However, as unequal-length byte sequences make simple tasks as indexing into a string, or determining its length in characters more complex, the internal representation is converted to fixed-length 16-bit UCS-16 in such cases. (This brings new problems with recent Unicodes that cross the 16-bit barrier... When practical use justifies it, this will have to change to UCS-32, or 4 bytes per character.)

Not all i18n issues are therefore automatically solved for the user. One still has to analyze seemingly simple tasks like uppercase conversion (Turkish dotted/undotted I make an anomaly) or sorting (&quot;collation order&quot; is not necessarily the numeric order of the Unicodes, as lsort would apply by default), and write custom routines if a more correct behavior is required. Other locale-dependent i18n issues like number/currency formatting, date/time handling also belong to this group. I recommend to start from the defaults Tcl provides, and if necessary, customize the appearance as desired. International data exchange is severely hampered if localized numeric data are exchanged, one side using period, the other comma as decimal point...

Strictly spoken, the Tcl implementation &quot;violates the UTF-8 spec, which explicitly forbids non-canonical representation of characters and requires that malformed UTF-8 sequences in the input be errors. ... I think that to be an advantage. But the spec says 'MUST' so we're at least technically non-compliant.&quot; (Kevin B. Kenny in the Tcl chat, 2003-05-13)

If textual data are internal to your Tcl script, all you have to know is the \uxxxx notation, which is substituted into the character with Unicode U+xxxx (hexadecimal). This notation can be used wherever Tcl substitution takes place, even in braced regexp's and string map pairlists; else you can force it by substing the string in question.

To demonstrate that for instance scan works transparently, here's a one-liner to format any Unicode character as HTML hex entity:

 proc c2html c {format &quot;&amp;#x%4.4x;&quot; [scan $c %c]}
Conversely it takes a few lines more:

 proc html2u string {
    while {[regexp {&amp;#[xX]([0-9A-Fa-f]+);} $string matched hex]} {
        regsub -all $matched $string [format %c 0x$hex] string
    }
    set string
 }
 % html2u &quot;this is a &amp;x20ac; sign&quot;
 this is a € sign

For all other purposes, two commands basically provide all i18n support:

 fconfigure $ch -encoding $e
enables conversion from/to encoding e for an open channel (file or socket) if different from system encoding;

 encoding convertfrom/to $e $string
does what it says, the other encoding being always Unicode.

For instance, I could easily decode the bytes EF BB BF from a hexdump with

 format %x [encoding convertfrom utf-8 \xef\xbb\xbf]

in an interactive tclsh, and found that it stood for the famous byte-order mark FEFF. Internally to Tcl, (almost) everything is a Unicode string. All communications with the operating system is done in the &quot;system encoding&quot;, which you can query (but best not change) with the [encoding system] command. Typical values are iso8859-1 or -15 on European Linuxes, and cp1252 on European Windowses.

'''Introspection''': Find out what encodings are available in your installation with
 encoding names

You can add new encodings by producing an .enc file and copying that in the directory lib/tcl8.4/encoding (or similar) where the other .enc files are situated. For the format of encoding files (which are text files, consisting mostly of hex digits), see the man page http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclLib/Encoding.htm . The basename of your .enc file (without the .enc extension) will be the name under which it can be addressed, e.g. for an encoding ''iso4711'' name the file ''iso4711.enc''.

=== Localization: message catalogs ===

Finally, the msgcat package supports localization (&quot;l10n&quot;) of apps by allowing message catalogs for translation of strings, typically for GUI display, from a base language (typically English) to a target language selected by the current locale. For example, an app to be localized for France might contain a file en_fr.msg with, for simplicity, only the line

 msgcat::mcset fr File Fichier

In the app itself, all you need is

 package require msgcat
 namespace import msgcat::mc
 msgcat::mclocale fr ;#(1)
 #...
 pack [button .b -text [mc File]]

to have the button display the localized text for &quot;File&quot;, namely &quot;Fichier&quot;, as obtained from the message catalog. For other locales, only a new message catalog has to be produced by translating from the base language. Instead of explicit setting as in (1), typically the locale information might come from an environment (LANG) or registry variable.

=== Tk: text rendering, fonts ===

Rendering international strings on displays or printers can pose the biggest problems. First, you need fonts that contain the characters in question. Fortunately, more and more fonts with international characters are available, a pioneer being Bitstream Cyberbit that contains roughly 40000 glyphs and was for some time offered for free download on the Web. Microsoft's Tahoma font also added support for most alphabet writings, including Arabic. Arial Unicode MS delivered with Windows 2000 contains just about all the characters in the Unicode, so even humble Notepad can get truly international with that.

But having a good font is still not enough. While strings in memory are arranged in logical order, with addresses increasing from beginning to end of text, they may need to be rendered in other ways, with diacritics shifted to various positions of the preceding character, or most evident for the languages that are written from right to left (&quot;r2l&quot;): Arabic, Hebrew. (Tk still lacks automatic &quot;bidi&quot;rectional treatment, so r2l strings have to be directed &quot;wrongly&quot; in memory to appear right when rendered - see A simple Arabic renderer on the Wiki).

Correct bidi treatment has consequences for cursor movement, line justification, and line wrapping as well. Vertical lines progressing from right to left are popular in Japan and Taiwan - and mandatory if you had to render Mongolian.

Indian scripts like Devanagari are alphabets with about 40 characters, but the sequence of consonants and vowels is partially reversed in rendering, and consonant clusters must be rendered as ligatures of the two or more characters involved - the pure single letters would look very ugly to an Indian. An Indian font for one writing system already contains several hundred glyphs. Unfortunately, Indian ligatures are not contained in the Unicode (while Arabic ones are), so various vendor standards apply for coding such ligatures.

==== A little i18n tester ====
[[Image:I18ntester_ce.jpg|left]]

Here's a little script that shows you what exotic characters your system has available. It creates a text window and tries to show some sample text for the specified languages (the screenshot is from a PocketPC in the Bitstream Cyberbit font):

 pack [text .t -font {Helvetica 16}]
 .t insert end &quot;
 Arabic \uFE94\uFEF4\uFE91\uFEAE\uFECC\uFEDF\uFE8D\uFE94\uFEE4\uFEE0\uFEDC\uFEDF\uFE8D
 Trad. Chinese      \u4E2D\u570B\u7684\u6F22\u5B57
 Simplified Chinese \u6C49\u8BED
 Greek   \u0395\u03BB\u03BB\u03B7\u03BD\u03B9\u03BA\u03AE\
 \u03B3\u03BB\u03CE\u03C3\u03C3\u03B1
 Hebrew  \u05DD\u05D9\u05DC\u05E9\u05D5\u05E8\u05D9\
 \u05DC\u05D9\u05D0\u05E8\u05E9\u05D9
 Japanese \u65E5\u672C\u8A9E\u306E\u3072\u3089\u304C\u306A,\
 \u6F22\u5B57\u3068\u30AB\u30BF\u30AB\u30CA

 \u044F\u0437\u044B\u043A
 &quot;
No font or size are specified, so you see the pure defaults (and notice how Tk manages to find characters). You can then configure the text widget for the fonts you'd like to see.

==== Input methods in Tcl/Tk ====

To get outlandish characters not seen on the keyboard into the machine, they may at lowest level be specified as escape sequences, e.g. &quot;\u2345&quot;. But most user input will come from keyboards, for which many layouts exist in different countries. In CJK countries, there is a separate coding level between keys and characters: keystrokes, which may stand for the pronunciation or geometric components of a character, are collected in a buffer and converted into the target code when enough context is available (often supported by on-screen menus to resolve ambiguities).

Finally, a &quot;virtual keyboard&quot; on screen, where characters are selected by mouse click, is especially helpful for non-frequent use of rarer characters, since the physical keyboard gives no hints which key is mapped to which other code. This can be implemented by a set of buttons, or minimally with a canvas that holds the provided characters as text items, and bindings to &lt;1&gt;, so clicking on a character inserts its code into the widget which has keyboard focus. See iKey: a tiny multilingual keyboard.

The term &quot;input methods&quot; is often used for operating-system-specific i18n support, but I have no experiences with this, doing i18n from a German Windows installation. So far I'm totally content with hand-crafted pure Tcl/Tk solutions - see taiku on the Wiki.

=== Transliterations: The Lish family ===

The Lish family is a set of transliterations, all designed to convert strings in lowly 7-bit ASCII to appropriate Unicode strings in some major non-Latin writing systems. The name comes from the common suffix &quot;lish&quot; as in English, which is actually the neutral element of the family, faithfully returning its input ;-) Some rules of thumb:

* One *lish character should unambiguously map to one target character, wherever applicable 
* One target letter should be represented by one *lish letter (A-Za-z), wherever applicable. Special characters and digits should be avoided for coding letters 
* Mappings should be intuitive and/or follow established practices 

* In languages that distinguish case, the corresponding substitutes for upper- and lowercase letters should also correspond casewise in lower ASCII.

The Tclers' Wiki http://mini.net/tcl/ has the members of the Lish family available for copy'n'paste. The ones I most frequently use are

* Arblish, which does context glyph selection and right-to-left conversion; 
* Greeklish; 
* Hanglish for Korean Hangul, which computes Unicodes from initial-vowel-final letters; 
* Ruslish for Cyrillic.

Calling examples, that return the Unicodes for the specified input:

   arblish   dby w Abw Zby
   greeklish Aqh'nai
   hanglish  se-qul
   heblish   irwsliM
   ruslish   Moskva i Leningrad

==== Greeklish ====
It all began with Greeklish, which is not my invention, but used by Greeks on the Internet for writing Greek without Greek fonts or character set support. I just extended the practice I found with the convention of marking accented vowels with a trailing apostrophe (so it's not a strict 1:1 transliteration anymore). Special care was taken to convert &quot;s&quot; at word end to &quot;c&quot;, so it produces the final-sigma. Here is the code:

 proc greeklish str {
   regsub -all {s([ \t\n.,:;])} $str {c\1} str
   string map {
    A' \u386 E' \u388 H' \u389 I' \u38a O' \u38c U' \u38e W' \u38f
    a' \u3ac e' \u3ad h' \u3ae i' \u3af o' \u3cc u' \u3cd w' \u3ce
    A \u391 B \u392 G \u393 D \u394 E \u395 Z \u396 H \u397 Q \u398
    I \u399 K \u39a L \u39b M \u39c N \u39d J \u39e O \u39f P \u3a0
    R \u3a1 S \u3a3 T \u3a4 U \u3a5 F \u3a6 X \u3a7 Y \u3a8 W \u3a9
    a \u3b1 b \u3b2 g \u3b3 d \u3b4 e \u3b5 z \u3b6 h \u3b7 q \u3b8
    i \u3b9 k \u3ba l \u3bb m \u3bc n \u3bd j \u3be o \u3bf p \u3c0
    r \u3c1 c \u3c2 s \u3c3 t \u3c4 u \u3c5 f \u3c6 x \u3c7 y \u3c8 
    w \u3c9 &quot;;&quot; \u387 ? &quot;;&quot;
   } $str
 }
Testing:
 % greeklish Aqh'nai
 Αθήναι
 % greeklish &quot;eis thn po'lin&quot;
 εις την πόλιν

==== Hanglish ====
Even though the Korean Hangul writing has many thousands of syllable characters, it is possible to compute the Unicode from the spelling of a syllable and vice versa. Here's how:
 proc hangul2hanglish s {
    set lead {g gg n d dd r m b bb s ss &quot;&quot; j jj c k t p h}
    set vowel {a ae ya yai e ei ye yei o oa oai oi yo u ue uei ui yu w wi i}
    set tail {&quot;&quot; g gg gs n nj nh d l lg lm lb ls lt lp lh m b bs s ss ng j c k t p h}
    set res &quot;&quot;
    foreach c [split $s &quot;&quot;] {
        scan $c %c cnum
        if {$cnum&gt;=0xAC00 &amp;&amp; $cnum&lt;0xD7A3} {
            incr cnum -0xAC00
            set l [expr {$cnum / (28*21)}]
            set v [expr {($cnum/28) % 21}]
            set t [expr {$cnum % 28}]
            append res  [lindex $lead $l ]
            append res  [lindex $vowel $v]
            append res &quot;[lindex $tail $t] &quot;
        } else {append res $c}
    }
    set res
 }
 proc hanglish2uc hanglish {
    set L &quot;&quot;; set V &quot;&quot; ;# in case regexp doesn't hit
    set hanglish [string map {
        AE R SH S R L NG Q YE X YAI F AI R YA V YO Y YU Z VI F
    } [string toupper $hanglish]]
    regexp {^([GNDLMBSQJCKTPH]+)?([ARVFEIXOYUZW]+)([GNDLMBSQJCKTPH]*)$} \
        $hanglish -&gt;  L V T ;# lead cons.-vowel-trail cons.
    if {$L==&quot;&quot;} {set L Q}
    if {$V==&quot;&quot;} {return $hanglish}
    set l [lsearch {G GG N D DD L M B BB S SS Q J JJ C K T P H} $L]
    set v [lsearch {A R V F E EI X XI O OA OR OI Y U UE UEI UI Z W WI I} $V]
    set t [lsearch {&quot;&quot; G GG GS N NJ NH D L LG LM LB LS LT LP LH  \
        M B BS S SS Q J C K T P H} $T] ;# trailing consonants
    if {[min $l $v $t] &lt; 0} {return $hanglish}
    format %c [expr {$l*21*28 + $v*28 + $t + 0xAC00}]
 }
 proc min args {lindex [lsort -real $args] 0}
 proc hanglish argl {
    set res &quot;&quot;
    foreach i $argl {
        foreach j [split $i -] {append res [hanglish2uc $j]}
    }
    append res &quot; &quot;
 }

=== Collation ===
Collation is &quot;the logical ordering of character or wide-character strings according to defined precedence rules. These rules identify a collation sequence between the collating elements, and such additional rules that can be used to order strings consisting of multiple collating elements.&quot;

Tcl's '''lsort''' sorts according to numerical Unicode values, which may not be correct in some locales. For instance, in Portuguese, accented letters should sort as if they weren't, but in Unicode sequence come after &quot;z&quot;.

The following simple code takes a map in which collation differences can be listed as {from to from to...}, sorts the mapped items, and retrieves only the original elements:

 proc collatesort {list map} {
    set l2 {}
    foreach e $list {
       lappend l2 [list $e [string map $map $e]]
    }
    set res {}
    foreach e [lsort -index 1 $l2] {lappend res [lindex $e 0]}
    set res
 }
Testing, Portuguese:

 % collatesort {ab ãc ãd ae} {ã a}
 ab ãc ãd ae
Spanish (ll sorts after lz):

----

The true joy of puzzles stems on them not being solved easily. Even if you have deep knowledge of puzzles you might find yourself stuck with the next one. Still there are some general and specific strategies that can help to solve puzzle. For some problems mathematical models have been developed which can deepen your insight into puzzles as well as mathematics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tcl itself is quite a good teacher. Don't be afraid to do something wrong - it will most often deliver a helpful error message. When tclsh is called with no arguments, it starts in an interactive mode and displays a &quot;%&quot; prompt. The user types something in and sees what comes out: either the result or an error message.

Trying isolated test cases interactively, and pasting the command into the editor when satisfied, can greatly reduce debugging time (there is no need to restart the application after every little change - just make sure it's the right one, before restarting.)

=== A quick tour ===

Here's a commented session transcript:

 % hello
 invalid command name &quot;hello&quot;
OK, so we're supposed to type in a command. Although it doesn't look so, here's one:
 % hi
      1  hello
     2  hi
Interactive tclsh tries to guess what we mean, and &quot;hi&quot; is the unambiguous prefix of the &quot;history&quot; command, whose results we see here. Another command worth remembering is &quot;info&quot;:
 % info
 wrong # args: should be &quot;info option ?arg arg ...?&quot;
The error message tells us there should be at least one option, and optionally more arguments.
 % info option
 bad option &quot;option&quot;: must be args, body, cmdcount, commands, complete, default,
 exists, functions, globals, hostname, level, library, loaded, locals, nameofexecutable,
 patchlevel, procs, script, sharedlibextension, tclversion, or vars
Another helpful error: &quot;option&quot; is not an option, but the valid ones are listed. To get information about commands, it makes sense to type the following:
 % info commands
 tell socket subst lremove open eof tkcon_tcl_gets pwd glob list exec pid echo 
 dir auto_load_index time unknown eval lrange tcl_unknown fblocked lsearch gets 
 auto_import case lappend proc break dump variable llength tkcon auto_execok return
 pkg_mkIndex linsert error bgerror catch clock info split thread_load loadvfs array
 if idebug fconfigure concat join lreplace source fcopy global switch which auto_qualify
 update tclPkgUnknown close clear cd for auto_load file append format tkcon_puts alias 
 what read package set unalias pkg_compareExtension binary namespace scan edit trace seek 
 while flush after more vwait uplevel continue foreach lset rename tkcon_gets fileevent 
 regexp tkcon_tcl_puts observe_var tclPkgSetup upvar unset encoding expr load regsub history
 exit interp puts incr lindex lsort tclLog observe ls less string
Oh my, quite many... How many?
 % llength [info commands]
 115
Now for a more practical task - let's let Tcl compute the value of Pi.
 % expr acos(-1)
 3.14159265359
Hm.. can we have that with more precision?
 % set tcl_precision 17
 17
 % expr acos(-1)
 3.1415926535897931
Back to the first try, where &quot;hello&quot; was an invalid command. Let's just create a valid one:
 % proc hello {} {puts Hi!}
Silently acknowledged. Now testing:
 % hello
 Hi!

=== Errors are exceptions ===

What in Tcl is called '''error''' is in fact more like an ''exception'' in other languages - you can deliberately raise an error, and also '''catch''' errors. Examples:

 if {$username eq &quot;&quot;} {error &quot;please specify a user name&quot;}

 if [catch {open $filename w} fp] {
    error &quot;$filename is not writable&quot;
 }
One reason for errors can be an undefined command name. One can use this playfully, together with ''catch'', as in the following example of a multi-loop ''break'', that terminates the two nested loops when a matrix element is empty:
 if [catch {
    foreach row $matrix {
       foreach col $row {
           if {$col eq &quot;&quot;} throw
       }
    }
 }] {puts &quot;empty matrix element found&quot;}
The ''throw'' command does not exist in normal Tcl, so it throws an error, which is caught by the ''catch'' around the outer loop.

==== The errorInfo variable ====

This global variable provided by Tcl contains the last error message and the traceback of the last error. Silly example:

 % proc foo {} {bar x}
 % proc bar {input} {grill$input}
 % foo
 invalid command name &quot;grillx&quot;

 % set errorInfo
 invalid command name &quot;grillx&quot;
    while executing
 &quot;grill$input&quot;
    (procedure &quot;bar&quot; line 1)
    invoked from within
 &quot;bar x&quot;
    (procedure &quot;foo&quot; line 1)
    invoked from within
 &quot;foo&quot;

If no error has occurred yet, ''errorInfo'' will contain the empty string.

==== The errorCode variable ====
In addition, there is the ''errorCode'' variable that returns a list of up to three elements:
* category (POSIX, ARITH, ...)
* abbreviated code for the last error
* human-readable error text

Examples:
 % open not_existing
 couldn't open &quot;not_existing&quot;: no such file or directory
 % set errorCode
 POSIX ENOENT {no such file or directory}

 % expr 1/0
 divide by zero
 % set errorCode
 ARITH DIVZERO {divide by zero}

 % foo
 invalid command name &quot;foo&quot;
 % set errorCode
 NONE

=== Tracing procedure calls ===
For a quick overview how some procedures are called, and when, and what do they return, and when, the ''trace execution'' is a valuable tool. Let's take the following factorial function as example:
 proc fac x {expr {$x&lt;2? 1 : $x * [fac [incr x -1]]}} 
We need to supply a handler that will be called with different numbers of arguments (two on enter, four on leave). Here's a very simple one:
 proc tracer args {puts $args}
Now we instruct the interpreter to trace ''enter'' and ''leave'' of ''fac'':
 trace add execution fac {enter leave} tracer
Let's test it with the factorial of 7:
 fac 7
which gives, on stdout:
 {fac 7} enter
 {fac 6} enter
 {fac 5} enter
 {fac 4} enter
 {fac 3} enter
 {fac 2} enter
 {fac 1} enter
 {fac 1} 0 1 leave
 {fac 2} 0 2 leave
 {fac 3} 0 6 leave
 {fac 4} 0 24 leave
 {fac 5} 0 120 leave
 {fac 6} 0 720 leave
 {fac 7} 0 5040 leave
So we can see how recursion goes down to 1, then returns in backward order, stepwise building up the final result. The 0 that comes as second word in &quot;leave&quot; lines is the return status, 0 being TCL_OK.

=== Stepping through a procedure ===
To find out how exactly a proc works (and what goes wrong where), you can also register commands to be called before and after a command inside a procedure is called (going down transitively to all called procs). You can use the following ''step'' and ''interact'' procedures for this:

 proc step {name {yesno 1}} {
    set mode [expr {$yesno? &quot;add&quot; : &quot;remove&quot;}]
    trace $mode execution $name {enterstep leavestep} interact
 }

 proc interact args {
    if {[lindex $args end] eq &quot;leavestep&quot;} {
        puts ==&gt;[lindex $args 2]
        return
    }
    puts -nonewline &quot;$args --&quot;
    while 1 {
        puts -nonewline &quot;&gt; &quot;
        flush stdout
        gets stdin cmd
        if {$cmd eq &quot;c&quot; || $cmd eq &quot;&quot;} break
        catch {uplevel 1 $cmd} res
        if {[string length $res]} {puts $res}
    }
 }

 #----------------------------Test case, a simple string reverter:
 proc sreverse str {
    set res &quot;&quot;
    for {set i [string length $str]} {$i &gt; 0} {} {
        append res [string index $str [incr i -1]]
    }
    set res
 }

 #-- Turn on stepping for [[sreverse]]:
 step sreverse
 sreverse hello

 #-- Turn off stepping (you can also type this command from inside interact):
 step sreverse 0
 puts [sreverse Goodbye]

The above code gives the following transcript when sourced into a tclsh:

 {set res {}} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;
 {for {set i [string length $str]} {$i &gt; 0} {} {
        append res [string index $str [incr i -1]]
    }} enterstep --&gt;
 {string length hello} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;5
 {set i 5} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;5
 {incr i -1} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;4
 {string index hello 4} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;o
 {append res o} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;o
 {incr i -1} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;3
 {string index hello 3} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;l
 {append res l} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;ol
 {incr i -1} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;2
 {string index hello 2} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;l
 {append res l} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;oll
 {incr i -1} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;1
 {string index hello 1} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;e
 {append res e} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;olle
 {incr i -1} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;0
 {string index hello 0} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;h
 {append res h} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;olleh
 ==&gt;
 {set res} enterstep --&gt;
 ==&gt;olleh
 eybdooG

=== Debugging ===
The simplest way to inspect why something goes wrong is inserting a ''puts'' command before the place where it happens. Say if you want to see the values of variables x and y, just insert
 puts x:$x,y:$y
(if the string argument contains no spaces, it needs not be quoted). The output will go to stdout - the console from where you started the script. On Windows or Mac, you  might need to add the command
 console show
to get the substitute console Tcl creates for you, when no real one is present.

If at some time you want to see details of what your program does, and at others not, you can define and redefine a ''dputs'' command that either calls ''puts'' or does nothing:
 proc d+ {} {proc dputs args {puts $args}}
 proc d- {} {proc dputs args {}}
 d+ ;# initially, tracing on... turn off with d-

For more debugging comfort, add the proc ''interact'' from above to your code, and put a call to ''interact'' before the place where the error happens. Some useful things to do at such a debugging prompt:
 info level 0    ;# shows how the current proc was called
 info level      ;# shows how deep you are in the call stack
 uplevel 1 ...   ;# execute the ... command one level up, i.e. in the caller of the current proc
 set ::errorInfo ;# display the last error message in detail

=== Assertions ===

Checking data for certain conditions is a frequent operation in coding. Absolutely intolerable conditions can just throw an error:

   if {$temperature &gt; 100} {error &quot;ouch... too hot!&quot;}

Where the error occurred is evident from ::errorInfo, which will look a bit clearer (no mention of the error command) if you code

   if {$temperature &gt; 100} {return -code error &quot;ouch... too hot!&quot;}

If you don't need hand-crafted error messages, you can factor such checks out to an assert command:

 proc assert condition {
    set s &quot;{$condition}&quot;
    if {![uplevel 1 expr $s]} {
        return -code error &quot;assertion failed: $condition&quot;
    }
 }
Use cases look like this:

   assert {$temperature &lt;= 100}

Note that the condition is reverted - as &quot;assert&quot; means roughly &quot;take for granted&quot;, the positive case is specified, and the error is raised if it is not satisfied.

Tests for internal conditions (that do not depend on external data) can be used during development, and when the coder is sure they are bullet-proof to always succeed, (s)he can turn them off centrally in one place by defining

 proc assert args {}

This way, assertions are compiled to no bytecode at all, and can remain in the source code as a kind of documentation.

If assertions are tested, it only happens at the position where they stand in the code. Using a trace, it is also possible to specify a condition once, and have it tested whenever a variable's value changes:

 proc assertt {varName condition} {
    uplevel 1 [list trace var $varName w &quot;assert $condition ;#&quot;]
 }
The &quot;;#&quot; at the end of the trace causes the additional arguments name element op, that are appended to the command prefix when a trace fires, to be ignored as a comment.

Testing:

 % assertt list {[llength $list]&lt;10}
 % set list {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8}
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 % lappend list 9 10
 can't set &quot;list&quot;: assertion failed: 10&lt;10
The error message isn't as clear as could be, because the [llength $list] is already substituted in it. But I couldn't find an easy solution to that quirk in this breakfast fun project - backslashing the $condition in the assertt code sure didn't help. Better ideas welcome.

To make the assertion condition more readable, we could quote the condition one more time,i.e 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
 % assertt list {{[llength $list]&lt;10}}
 % set list {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8}
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 % lappend list 9 10
 can't set &quot;list&quot;: assertion failed: [llength $list]&lt;10
 % 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In this case,when trace trigger fires, the argument for assert is {[llength $list]&lt;10}.


In any case, these few lines of code give us a kind of bounds checking - the size of Tcl's data structures is in principle only bounded by the available virtual memory, but runaway loops may be harder to debug, compared to a few assertt calls for suspicious variables:

 assertt aString {[string length $aString]&lt;1024}
or

 assertt anArray {[array size anArray] &lt; 1024*1024}

Tcllib has a control::assert with more bells and whistles.

=== A tiny testing framework ===

Bugs happen. The earlier found, the easier for the coder, so the golden rule &quot;Test early. Test often&quot; should really be applied.

One easy way is adding self-tests to a file of Tcl code. When the file is loaded as part of a library, just the proc definitions are executed. If however you feed this file directly to a tclsh, that fact is detected, and the &quot;e.g.&quot; calls are executed. If the result is not the one expected, this is reported on stdout; and in the end, you even get a little statistics.

Here's a file that implements and demonstrates &quot;e.g.&quot;:

 # PROLOG -- self-test: if this file is sourced at top level:
 if {[info exists argv0]&amp;&amp;[file tail [info script]] eq [file tail $argv0]} {
    set Ntest 0; set Nfail 0
    proc e.g. {cmd -&gt; expected} {
        incr ::Ntest
        catch {uplevel 1 $cmd} res
        if {$res ne $expected} {
            puts &quot;$cmd -&gt; $res, expected $expected&quot;
            incr ::Nfail
        }
    }
 } else {proc e.g. args {}} ;# does nothing, compiles to nothing

 ##------------- Your code goes here, with e.g. tests following
 proc sum {a b} {expr {$a+$b}}
 e.g. {sum 3 4} -&gt; 7

 proc mul {a b} {expr {$a*$b}}
 e.g. {mul 7 6} -&gt; 42

 # testing a deliberate error (this way, it passes):
 e.g. {expr 1/0} -&gt; &quot;divide by zero&quot;

 ## EPILOG -- show statistics:
 e.g. {puts &quot;[info script] : tested $::Ntest, failed $::Nfail&quot;} -&gt; &quot;&quot;

=== Guarded proc ===

In more complex Tcl software, it may happen that a procedure is defined twice with different body and/or args, causing hard-to-track errors. The Tcl command ''proc'' itself doesn't complain if it is called with an existing name. Here is one way to add this functionality. Early in your code, you overload the proc command like this:

  rename proc _proc
  _proc proc {name args body} {
  	set ns [uplevel namespace current]
  	if {[info commands $name]!=&quot;&quot; || [info commands ${ns}::$name]!=&quot;&quot;} {
  		puts stderr &quot;warning: [info script] redefines $name in $ns&quot;
  	}
  	uplevel [list _proc $name $args $body]
  }

From the time that is sourced, any attempt to override a proc name will be reported to stderr (on Win-wish, it would show on the console in red). You may make it really strict by adding an &quot;exit&quot; after the &quot;puts stderr ...&quot;, or throw an error.

Known feature: proc names with wildcards will run into this trap, e.g.

   proc * args {expr [join $args *]*1}
will always lead to a complaint because &quot;*&quot; fits any proc name. Fix (some regsub magic on 'name') left as an exercise.

=== Windows wish console ===

While on Unixes, the standard channels ''stdin'', ''stdout'', and ''stderr'' are the same as the terminal you started wish from, a Windows ''wish'' doesn't typically have these standard channels (and is mostly started with double-click anyway). To help this, a console was added that takes over the standard channels (stderr even coming in red, stdin in blue). The console is normally hidden, but can be brought up with the command

  console show

You can also use the partially documented &quot;console&quot; command. &quot;console eval &lt;script&gt;&quot; evals the given script in the Tcl interpreter that manages the console. The console's text area is actually a text widget created in this interpreter. For example:

        console eval {.console config -font Times}
will change the font of the console to &quot;Times&quot;. Since the console is a Tk text widget, you can use all text widget commands and options on it (for example, changing colors, bindings...). 

 console eval {winfo children .}
tells you more about the console widget: it is a toplevel with children .menu, .console (text), and .sb (scrollbar). You can resize the whole thing with

 console eval {wm geometry . $Wx$H+$X+$Y}
where $W and $H are dimensions in character cells (default 80x24), but $X and $Y are in pixels.

And more again: you can even add widgets to the console - try

 console eval {pack [button .b -text hello -command {puts hello}]}

The button appears between the text widget and the scroll bar, and looks and does as expected. 
There is also a way back: the main interpreter is visible in the console interpreter under the name, consoleinterp.

=== Remote debugging ===

Here's a simple experiment on how to connect two Tcl processes so that one (call it &quot;debugger&quot;) can inspect and control the other (&quot;debuggee&quot;). Both must have an event loop running (which is true when Tk runs, or when started with e.g. ''vwait forever''). 

As this goes over a socket connection, the two processes could be on different hosts and operating systems (though I've so far tested only the localhost variety). Use at your own risk, of course... :^)

The &quot;debuggee&quot; contains in my experiments the following code, in addition to its own:

 proc remo_server &lt;nowiki&gt;{{port 3456}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; {
    set sock [socket -server remo_accept $port]
 }
 proc remo_accept {socket adr port} {
    fileevent $socket readable [list remo_go $socket]
 }
 proc remo_go {sock} {
    gets $sock line
    catch {uplevel \#0 $line} res
    puts $sock $res
    if [catch {flush $sock}] {close $sock}
 }
 remo_server

The &quot;debugger&quot; in this version (remo.tcl) runs only on Windows in a wish, as it needs a console, but you could modify it to avoid these restrictions:

 #!/usr/bin/env wish
 console show
 wm withdraw .
 set remo [socket localhost 3456]
 fileevent $remo readable &quot;puts \[gets $remo\]&quot;
 proc r args {puts $::remo [join $args]; flush $::remo}
 puts &quot;remote connection ready - use r to talk&quot;

Now from ''remo'' you can call any Tcl command in the &quot;debuggee&quot;, where it is executed in global scope, so in particular you can inspect (and modify) global variables. But you could also redefine procs on the fly, or whatever tickles your fancy... Examples from a remo session, showing that the two have different pids, how errors are reported, and that quoting is different from normal (needs more work):

 10 % pid
 600
 11 % r pid
 2556
 12 % r wm title . &quot;Under remote control&quot;
 wrong # args: should be &quot;wm title window ?newTitle?&quot;
 13 % r wm title . {&quot;Under remote control&quot;}

The Tk (Tool Kit) is the most popular Tcl extension for designing graphical user interfaces (GUI) on Macintosh, Unix/Linux, or Windows operating systems.

With little effort, it allows to put together useful 
* windows (forms, as some call them) consisting of 
* ''widgets'', which are managed by
* ''geometry managers''. Also, you can easily define 
* bindings of mouse or keyboard events to trigger the actions you want. 

====Example: calculator ====
Here is a very simple, complete Tcl/Tk script that implements a calculator:
 package require Tk
 pack [entry .e -textvar e -width 50]
 bind .e &lt;Return&gt; {
    set e  [regsub { *=.*} $e &quot;&quot;] ;# remove evaluation (Chris)
    catch {expr [string map {/ *1./} $e]} res
    append e &quot; = $res&quot;
 } 
It creates an ''entry'' widget named ''.e'', into which you can type from the keyboard, with an associated variable ''e'' (which will mirror the entry's content), and manages it with ''pack''. 

One binding is defined: if with keyboard focus on .e, the &lt;Return&gt; key is hit, then
* all division operators (/) in the variable ''e'' are mapped to &quot;*1./&quot; (this forces floating point division), 
* the resulting string is fed to ''expr'' to evaluate it as an arithmetic/logic expression
* as there may be errors in the user input, the ''expr'' call is wrapped into a ''catch'' which assigns either the result of ''expr'', or the error message if one occurred, into the variable ''res''
* the result of the last evaluation is cleared by deleting everything after ''=''
* finally, an equal sign and the value of the ''res'' variable are ''append''ed to ''e'', making input and result immediately visible in the entry.

==== Example: a tiny IRC client ====
As before in the Tcl section, here's a working little script again: a client for IRC (Internet Relay Chat) in 38 lines of code, that features a '''text''' and an '''entry''' widget:

[[Image:Picoirc.gif]]

 package require Tk
 set ::server irc.freenode.org
 set ::chan   #tcl
 set ::me     $tcl_platform(user)
 text .t -height 30 -wrap word -font {Arial 9}
 .t tag config bold   -font [linsert [.t cget -font] end bold]
 .t tag config italic -font [linsert [.t cget -font] end italic]
 .t tag config blue   -foreground blue
 entry .cmd
 pack .cmd -side bottom -fill x
 pack .t -fill both -expand 1
 bind .cmd &lt;Return&gt; post
 proc recv {} {
     gets $::fd line
     if {[regexp {:([^!]*)![^ ].* +PRIVMSG ([^ :]+) +:(.*)} $line -&gt; \
         nick target msg]} {
         set tag &quot;&quot;
         if [regexp {\001ACTION(.+)\001} $msg -&gt; msg] {set tag italic}
         if [in {azbridge ijchain} $nick] {regexp {&lt;([^&gt;]+)&gt;(.+)} $msg -&gt; nick msg}
        .t insert end $nick\t bold $msg\n $tag
     } else {.t insert end $line\n italic}
     .t yview end
 }
 proc in {list element} {expr {[lsearch -exact $list $element]&gt;=0}}
 proc post {} {
     set msg [.cmd get]
     if [regexp {^/me (.+)} $msg -&gt; action] {set msg &quot;\001ACTION $action\001&quot;}
     foreach line [split $msg \n] {send &quot;PRIVMSG $::chan :$line&quot;}
     .cmd delete 0 end
     set tag &quot;&quot;
     if [regexp {\001ACTION(.+)\001} $msg -&gt; msg] {set tag italic}
     .t insert end $::me\t {bold blue} $msg\n [list blue $tag]
     .t yview end
 }
 proc send str {puts $::fd $str; flush $::fd}
 set ::fd [socket $::server 6667]
 send &quot;NICK $::me&quot;
 send &quot;USER $::me 0 * :PicoIRC user&quot;
 send &quot;JOIN $::chan&quot;
 fileevent $::fd readable recv
 bind . &lt;Escape&gt; {exec wish $argv0 &amp;; exit}

The last line is a quick debugging helper: if you modified the script in the editor, save to disk, then hit &lt;Escape&gt; in the app to start it anew.

=== Widgets ===
Widgets are GUI objects that, when mapped by a geometry manager, correspond to a rectangular area on the screen, with different properties and capabilities.

Widgets are named with ''path'' names, somehow resembling file system path names, except that the separator for widgets is a period &quot;.&quot;. 
For example, ''.foo.bar'' is a child of ''foo'' which is a child of &quot;.&quot;  Parent-child relation occurs typically with containers, e.g. ''toplevel, frame, canvas, text''. 
The name parts (i.e. between the dots) can be almost any string that does not contain &quot;.&quot; of course, or starts with a Capital Letter (this is because widget class names with capital initial have a special meaning, they denote class-wide options).

If you have a proc that takes a parent widget ''w'' and adds children, it may be important to distinguish whether ''w'' is &quot;.&quot; or another - because you can't concatenate a child widget name directly to &quot;.&quot; - $w.kid will make an invalid name if $w == &quot;.&quot;. Here's how to avoid this:
 set w2 [expr {$w eq &quot;.&quot;? &quot;&quot;: $w}]
 button $w2.$kid ...

Widgets are created by a command named after their class, which then takes the path name (requiring that parent widgets have to exist by that time) and any number of ''-key value'' options that make up the original configuration, e.g.
 button .b -text &quot;Hello!&quot; -command {do something}
After creation, communication with the widget goes via a created command that corresponds to its name. For instance, the configuration options can be queried
 set text [.b cget -text]
or changed
 .b configure -text Goodbye! -background red
Some &quot;methods&quot; like ''cget, configure'' are generic to all widget classes, others are specific to one or a few. For instance, both 'text'' and ''entry'' accept the ''insert'' method. 
See the manual pages for all the details.

Widgets appear on screen only after they have been given to a '''geometry manager''' (see more below). Example:
 text .t -wrap word
 pack .t -fill both -expand 1
As widget creation commands return the pathname, these two steps can also be nested like
 pack [text .t -wrap word] -fill both -expand 1

The '''destroy''' command deletes a widget and all of its child widgets, if present:
 destroy .b

The following sub-chapters describe the widgets available in Tk.
-----

==== button ====
With text and/or image, calls a configurable command when clicked. Example:
 button .b -text Hello! -command {puts &quot;hello, world&quot;}

==== canvas ====
Scrollable graphic surface for line, rectangle, polygon, oval, and  text items, as well as bitmaps and photo images and whole embedded windows. See for example &quot;A tiny drawing program&quot; below. Example:
 pack [canvas .c -background white]
 .c create line 50 50 100 100 150 50 -fill red -width 3
 .c create text 100 50 -text Example

'''Pan a canvas''' (scroll it inside its window with middle mouse-button held down) by inheriting the text widget bindings:
  bind .c &lt;2&gt; [bind Text &lt;2&gt;]
  bind .c &lt;B2-Motion&gt; [bind Text &lt;B2-Motion&gt;]

==== entry ====
One-line editable text field, horizontally scrollable (see example above). You can specify a validation function to constrain what is entered. Example:
 entry .e -width 20 -textvariable myVar
 set myVar &quot;this text appears in the entry&quot;


==== frame ====
Container for several widgets, often used with ''pack'', or for wrapping &quot;megawidgets&quot;

==== label ====
One- or multiline field for text display, can be tied to a text variable to update when that variable changes. Linebreaks are specified by \n in the text to be displayed.

==== labelframe ====
A container similar to a '''frame''', decorated with a thin rectangle around, and a label at top-left position. Example (a tiny radio band selector):
 pack [labelframe .lf -text Band]
 pack [radiobutton .lf.am -text AM -variable band -value AM]
 pack [radiobutton .lf.fm -text FM -variable band -value FM]
 set band AM

[[Image:Labelframe_radiobuttons.jpg]]

==== listbox ====
Multiline display of a list, scrollable. Single or multiple items can be selected with the mouse.

==== menu ====
To add a menu to a GUI application, take steps of three kinds:
* Create the toplevel horizontal menu (needed only once):
 . configure -menu [menu .m]
* For each item in the top menu, create a cascaded submenu, e.g.
 .m add cascade -label File -menu [menu .m.mFile]
* For each entry in a submenu, add it like this:
 .m.mFile add command -label Open -command {openFile ...}
 .m.mFile add separator

As these commands are a bit verbose, one can wrap them into a little helper:
 proc m+ {head name {cmd &quot;&quot;}} {
    if {![winfo exists .m.m$head]} {
         .m add cascade -label $head -menu [menu .m.m$head -tearoff 0]
    }
    if [regexp ^-+$ $name] {
            .m.m$head add separator
    } else {.m.m$head add command -label $name -comm $cmd}
 }
Demo example - now menu items can be created in a much clearer way:

 . configure -menu [menu .m]
 m+ File Open {.t insert end &quot;opened\n&quot;}
 m+ File Save {.t insert end &quot;saved\n&quot;}
 m+ File -----
 m+ File Exit exit
 m+ Edit Cut ...
 pack [text .t -wrap word] -fill both -expand 1

==== radiobutton ====
A button with a selector field which can be on or off, and a label. Clicking the selector field with the mouse changes the value of an associated global variable. Typically, multiple radiobuttons are tied to the same variable. For examples, see '''labelframe''' above.

==== scrollbar ====
Horizontal or vertical scrollbars (vertical being the default, for horizontal specify: -orientation horizontal, or -ori hori if you like it short) can be tied to canvas, entry, listbox or text widgets. The interaction between a scrollbar and its scrolled widget goes with callbacks, in which one notifies the other:
* scrollbar to widget: ''xview'' or ''yview'' method
* widget to scrollbar: ''set'' method
Arguments to these methods will be automatically added when the callbacks are invoked.

For example, here's how to connect a text widget with a vertical scrollbar:
 pack [scrollbar .y -command &quot;.t yview&quot;] -side right -fill y
 pack [text .t -wrap word -yscrollc &quot;.y set&quot;] \
      -side right -fill both -expand 1

With most widgets, scrollbars adjust automatically to the widget's contents. For canvas widgets, you need to update the scrollregion after adding new items. most simply like this:
 $canvas configure -scrollregion [$canvas bbox all]

==== text ====
Scrollable editable multiline text with many formatting options. Can also contain images and embedded widgets. The default wrapping setting is &quot;none&quot;, so you might need a horizontal scrollbar to see all of long lines. In many cases it's more user-friendly to configure a text widget as ''-wrap word'' - then you only need a vertical scrollbar at most.

Positions in a text widget are specified as ''line.column'', where line starts from 1, and column from 0, so 1.0 is the very first character in a text widget. Example how to delete all contents:
 $t delete 1.0 end
For highlighting part of the contents, you can define ''tags'' and assign them to subsequences:
 $t tag configure ul -underline 1
 $t insert end &quot;The next word is &quot; {} underlined ul &quot;, the rest is not.&quot;

==== toplevel ====

Standalone frame window, mostly with decorations (title bar, buttons) from the window manager. When you start Tk, you receive an initially empty toplevel named &quot;.&quot; (one dot). If you want more toplevels, create them like this:
 toplevel .mySecondWindow
Such toplevels are logically children of &quot;.&quot;. To assign a nice title to a toplevel, use
 wm title $toplevel &quot;This is the title&quot;
You can also control the geometry (size and position) of a toplevel with
 wm geometry $toplevel ${width}x$height+$x+$y

----

=== Geometry managers ===
----
The purpose of geometry managers is to compute the required height, width, and location of widgets, and map them on screen. Besides ''grid'', ''pack'' and ''place'', the ''canvas'' and ''text'' widgets can also manage embedded widgets.

Calls to geometry managers always start with the manager's name, then (mostly) one or more widget names, then any number of ''-name value'' options

==== grid ====
This geometry manager is best suited for tabular window layout consisting of rows and columns. Example, to put three widgets in a horizontal row:
 grid .1 .2 .3 -sticky news
The ''-sticky'' option indicates what side of its box the widget should stick to, in compass direction; &quot;news&quot; is north-east-west-south&quot;, i.e. all four sides.

Here's a minimal solution to display a table (list of lists) in a grid of labels:

[[Image:grid_table.jpg]]

 package require Tk
 proc table {w content args} {
     frame $w -bg black
     set r 0
     foreach row $content {
         set fields {}
         set c 0
         foreach col $row {
             lappend fields [label $w.$r/$c -text $col]
             incr c
         }
         eval grid $fields -sticky news -padx 1 -pady 1
         incr r
     }
     set w
 }

 #--- Test:
 table .t {
    {Row Head1 Head2}
    {1   foo   42}
    {2   bar   1234}
    {3   grill testing}
 }
 pack .t

 #--- Changing the contents, given row and column number:
 after 2000 .t.3/2 config -text Coucou

==== pack ====
This used to be the workhorse manager, but in recent years has been less popular than '''grid'''.  Anyway, it is still good for cases where you have widgets aligned in only one direction (horizontally or vertically). For more complex layouts, one used to insert intermediate frames, but grid makes such jobs just easier. 
Example:
 pack .x -fill both -expand 1 -side left

==== place ====
This geometry manager is not often used, mostly for special applications, like when you want to highlight the current tab of a tab notebook. It allows pixel-precise placement of widgets, but is less dynamic in reaction to resizing of the toplevel or inner widgets.

=== Dialogs ===
Dialogs are toplevels that are to tell a message, or answer a question. You don't have to assign a widget path name to them. Just call them as functions and evaluate the result (often &quot;&quot; if the dialog was canceled).

==== tk_getOpenFile ====
A file selector dialog (limited to existing files). Returns the selected file with path name, or &quot;&quot; if canceled.

==== tk_getSaveFile ====
A file selector dialog, which also allows specification of a not existing file. Returns the selected file with path name, or &quot;&quot; if canceled.

==== tk_messageBox ====
A simple dialog that displays a string and can be closed with an &quot;OK&quot; button. Example:
 tk_messageBox -message &quot;hello, world!&quot;

==== Custom dialogs ====
Besides the prefabricated dialogs that come with Tk, it's also not too hard to build custom ones.
As a very simple example, here's a &quot;value dialog&quot; that prompts the user for to type in a value:

[[image:ValueDialog.jpg]]

 proc value_dialog {string} {
    set w [toplevel .[clock seconds]]
    wm resizable $w 0 0
    wm title $w &quot;Value request&quot;
    label  $w.l -text $string
    entry  $w.e -textvar $w -bg white
    bind $w.e &lt;Return&gt; {set done 1}
    button $w.ok     -text OK     -command {set done 1}
    button $w.c      -text Clear  -command &quot;set $w {}&quot;
    button $w.cancel -text Cancel -command &quot;set $w {}; set done 1&quot;
    grid $w.l  -    -        -sticky news
    grid $w.e  -    -        -sticky news
    grid $w.ok $w.c $w.cancel
    vwait done
    destroy $w
    set ::$w
 }
Test:
 set test [value_dialog &quot;Give me a value please:&quot;]
 puts test:$test
 pack [ label .l -text &quot;Value: '$test' &quot; ]

For a more elaborate example, here is a record editor dialog (multiple fields, each with a label and entry (or text for multi-line input)):
 proc editRecord {title headers fields} {
     set oldfocus [focus]
     set w [toplevel .[clock clicks]]
     wm resizable $w 1 0
     wm title $w $title
     set n 0
     foreach h $headers f $fields {
         if ![regexp {(.+)([=+])} $h -&gt; hdr type] {set hdr $h; set type &quot;&quot;}
         label $w.h$n -text $hdr -anchor ne
         switch -- $type {
             = {label $w.e$n -width [string length $f] -text $f -anchor w -bg white}
             + {[text $w.e$n -width 20 -height 6] insert end $f}
             default {[entry $w.e$n -width [string length $f]] insert end $f}
         }
         grid $w.h$n $w.e$n -sticky news
         incr n
     }
     button $w.ok -text OK -width 5 -command [list set $w 1]
     button $w.cancel -text Cancel -command [list set $w 0]
     grid $w.ok $w.cancel -pady 5
     grid columnconfigure $w 1 -weight 1
     vwait ::$w
     if [set ::$w] { #-- collect the current entry contents
         set n 0
         foreach h $headers f $fields {
             regexp {([^=+].+)([=+]?)} $h -&gt; hdr type
             switch -- $type {
                 &quot;&quot; {lappend res [$w.e$n get]}
                 =  {lappend res [$w.e$n cget -text]}
                 +  {lappend res [$w.e$n get 1.0 end]}
             }
             incr n
         }
     } else {set res {}}
     destroy $w
     unset ::$w ;#-- clean up the vwait variable
     focus $oldfocus
     return $res
 }

Quick test:

 editRecord Test {foo= bar grill+} {one two three}

=== Megawidgets made easy ===
The term &quot;megawidgets&quot; is popular for compound widgets that in themselves contain other widgets, even though they will hardly number a million (what the prefix ''Mega-'' suggests), more often the child widgets' number will not exceed ten.

To create a megawidget, one needs one proc with the same signature as Tk widget creation commands.
This proc will, when called, create another proc named after the widget, and dispatch methods either to specific handlers, or the generic widget command created by Tk.

==== A little notebook ====
Plain Tk does not contain a &quot;notebook&quot; widget, with labeled tabs on top that raise one of the &quot;pages&quot;, but it's easy to make one. This example demonstrates how the tabs are implemented as buttons in a frame, and how the original Tk command named like the frame is &quot;overloaded&quot; to accept the additional ''add'' and ''raise'' methods:

 proc notebook {w args} {
    frame $w
    pack [frame $w.top] -side top -fill x -anchor w
    rename $w _$w
    proc $w {cmd args} { #-- overloaded frame command
        set w [lindex [info level 0] 0]
        switch -- $cmd {
            add     {notebook'add   $w $args}
            raise   {notebook'raise $w $args}
            default {eval [linsert $args 0 _$w $cmd]}
        }
    }
    return $w
 }

 proc notebook'add {w title} {
    set btn [button $w.top.b$title -text $title -command [list $w raise $title]]
    pack $btn -side left -ipadx 5
    set f [frame $w.f$title -relief raised -borderwidth 2]
    pack $f -fill both -expand 1
    $btn invoke
    bind $btn &lt;3&gt; &quot;destroy {$btn}; destroy {$f}&quot; ;# (1)
    return $f
 }

 proc notebook'raise {w title} {
    foreach i [winfo children $w.top] {$i config -borderwidth 0}
    $w.top.b$title config -borderwidth 1
    set frame $w.f$title
    foreach i [winfo children $w] {
        if {![string match *top $i] &amp;&amp; $i ne $frame} {pack forget $i}
    }
    pack $frame -fill both -expand 1
 }

Test and demo code:

 package require Tk
 pack [notebook .n] -fill both -expand 1
 set p1 [.n add Text]
 pack   [text $p1.t -wrap word] -fill both -expand 1
 set p2 [.n add Canvas]
 pack   [canvas $p2.c -bg yellow] -fill both -expand 1
 set p3 [.n add Options]
 pack   [button $p3.1 -text Console -command {console show}]
 .n raise Text
 wm geometry . 400x300

=== Binding events ===
Events within Tcl/Tk include actions performed by the user, such as pressing a key or clicking the mouse.  To react to mouse and keyboard activity, the bind command is used.  As shown in the calculator example: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
 pack [entry .e -textvar e -width 50]
 bind .e &lt;Return&gt; {
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt; keyword operates on &lt;code&gt;.e&lt;/code&gt; and associates the event related to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;return&gt;&lt;/code&gt; event.  The following bracket indicates a start of a set of procedures which are executed when the event is performed. 

=== BWidget ===
BWidget is an extension to Tk written in pure Tcl (therefore it can even run on Windows Mobile-driven cell phones). It offers mega-widgets (all class names starting with Uppercase) like
* ComboBox
* NoteBook
* Tree
 [[Image:ifile01.jpg]]
''Screenshot of a NoteBook and a Tree, on a PocketPC under Windows/CE''

==== Tree examples ====
Here is a &quot;hello world&quot; example of a Tree widget (this is a complete script). 
The root node is constantly called ''root'', for the others you have to make up names:
 package require BWidget
 pack [Tree .t]
 .t insert end root n1  -text hello
 .t insert end root n2  -text world
 .t insert end n2   n21 -text (fr:monde)
 .t insert end n2   n22 -text (de:Welt)
The famous typewriter test sentence represented as a syntax tree:
 package require BWidget
 pack [Tree .t -height 16] -fill both -expand 1
 foreach {from to text} {
    root S S
    S   np1  NP
    S   vp   VP
    np1 det1 Det:The
    np1 ap1  AP
    ap1 adj1 Adj:quick
    ap1 adj2 Adj:brown
    ap1 n1   N:fox
    vp  v    V:jumps
    vp  pp   PP
    pp  prep Prep:over
    pp  np2  NP
    np2 det2 Det:the
    np2 ap2  AP
    ap2 adj3 Adj:lazy
    ap2 n2   N:dog
    
 } {.t insert end $from $to -text $text}
 .t opentree S

=== Tk resources ===
==== Colors ====
Colors in Tk can be specified in three ways:
* a symbolic name, like: red green blue yellow magenta cyan
* a hex string preceded by a #: #RGB, #RRGGBB, #RRRRGGGGBBBB
* a list of three non-negative integers
The last form is only returned by commands. To specify a color to a command, you'll have to hex-format it. For instance, white could be described as #FFFFFF.

To turn a symbolic name into its RGB components:
 winfo rgb . $colorname

Here is the list of defined color names (as from X11's rgb.txt):
 set COLORS { snow {ghost white} {white smoke} gainsboro {floral white}
    {old lace} linen {antique white} {papaya whip} {blanched almond}
    bisque {peach puff} {navajo white} moccasin cornsilk ivory {lemon

In addition, the following are defined on Windows:
 set WINDOWSCOLORS {
    SystemButtonFace SystemButtonText SystemDisabledText SystemHighlight
    SystemHightlightText SystemMenu SystemMenuText SystemScrollbar
    SystemWindow SystemWindowFrame SystemWindowText
 }

==== Cursors ====
For every widget, you can specify how the mouse cursor should look when over it. Here's the list of defined cursor names:
 set cursors {
    X_cursor arrow based_arrow_down based_arrow_up boat bogosity
    bottom_left_corner bottom_right_corner bottom_side bottom_tee
    box_spiral center_ptr circle clock coffee_mug cross cross_reverse
    crosshair diamond_cross dot dotbox double_arrow draft_large draft_small
    draped_box exchange fleur gobbler gumby hand1 hand2 heart icon
    iron_cross left_ptr left_side left_tee leftbutton ll_angle lr_angle
    man middlebutton mouse pencil pirate plus question_arrow right_ptr
    right_side right_tee rightbutton rtl_logo sailboat sb_down_arrow
    sb_h_double_arrow sb_left_arrow sb_right_arrow sb_up_arrow
    sb_v_double_arrow shuttle sizing spider spraycan star target tcross
    top_left_arrow top_left_corner top_right_corner top_side top_tee 
    trek ul_angle umbrella ur_angle watch xterm
 }
A little tool that presents the cursor names, and shows each cursor shape when mousing over:
 set ncols 4
 for {set i 0} {$i&lt;$ncols} {incr i} {
    lappend cols col$i
 }
 set nmax [expr {int([llength $cursors]*1./$ncols)}]
 foreach col $cols {
    set $col [lrange $cursors 0 $nmax]
    set cursors [lrange $cursors [expr $nmax+1] end]
 }
 label .top -text &quot;Move the cursor over a name to see how it looks&quot; \
    -relief ridge
 grid .top -columnspan $ncols -sticky news -ipady 2
 for {set i 0} {$i&lt;[llength $col0]} {incr i} {
    set row {}
    foreach col $cols {
        set name [lindex [set $col] $i]
        if {$name eq &quot;&quot;} break
        lappend row .l$name
        label .l$name -text $name -anchor w
        bind .l$name &lt;Enter&gt; [list %W config -cursor $name]
    }
    eval grid $row -sticky we
 }

==== Fonts ====
Fonts are provided by the windowing system. Which are available depends on the local installation. Find out which fonts are available with
 font families

The typical description of a font is a list of up to three elements:
 family size ?style?
Example:
 set f {{Bitstream Cyberbit} 10 bold}
Family is a name like Courier, Helvetica, Times, ... Best pick one of the names delivered by ''font families'', though there may be some mappings like &quot;Helvetica&quot; -&gt; &quot;Arial&quot;

Size is point size (a typographer's point is 1/72th of an inch) if positive, or pixel size if negative. Normal display fonts often have a size of 9 or 10.

Style can be a list of zero or more of bold, italic, underlined, ...

==== Images: photos and bitmaps ====

Tk allows simple yet powerful operations on images. These come in two varieties: bitmaps and photos. Bitmaps are rather limited in functionality, they can be specified in XBM format, and rendered in configurable colors.

Photos have much more possibilities - you can load and save them in different file formats (Tk itself supports PPM and GIF - for others, use the Img extension), copy them with many options, like scaling/subsampling or mirroring, and get or set the color of single pixels. 

Setting can also do rectangular regions in one go, as the following example shall demonstrate that creates a photo image of a tricolore flag (three even-spaced vertical bands - like France, Italy, Belgium, Ireland and many more). The default is France. 
You can specify the width, the height will be 2/3 of that.
The procedure returns the image name - just save it in -format GIF if you want:

 proc tricolore {w {colors {blue white red}}} {
    set im [image create photo]
    set fromx 0
    set dx [expr $w/3]
    set tox $dx
    set toy [expr $w*2/3]
    foreach color $colors {
        $im put $color -to $fromx 0 $tox $toy
        incr fromx $dx; incr tox $dx
    }
    set im
 }

 # Test - display flag on canvas:
 pack [canvas .c -width 200 -height 200 -background grey]
 .c create image 100 100 -image [tricolore 150]

 # Test - save image of flag to file:
 [tricolore 300] write tric.gif -format gif

=== Debugging Tk programs ===

A Tk program under development can be very rapidly debugged by adding such bindings:

 bind . &lt;F1&gt; {console show}
This works only on Windows and Macintosh (pre-OS-X) and brings up a console in which you can interact with the Tcl interpreter, inspect or modify global variables, configure widgets, etc.

 bind . &lt;Escape&gt; {eval [list exec wish $argv0] $argv &amp;; exit}
This starts a new instance of the current program (assuming you edited a source file and saved it to disk), and then terminates the current instance.

For short debugging output, one can also use the window's title bar. For example, to display the current mouse coordinates when it moves:
 bind . &lt;Motion&gt; {wm title . %X/%Y}

=== Other languages ===
Other programming languages have modules that interface and use Tcl/Tk:
* In R (programming language), there's a tcltk library, invoked with the command '''library(tcltk)'''
* In Python, there's a tkinter module, invoked with '''import tkinter''' or '''from tkinter import *'''

This article isn't very structured and it lacks some basic info like overloading operators through friend functions. It would be nice if there was something written about that. [[User:Mecanismo|Mecanismo]] 14:58, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

== Overloadable Operators: Bitwise operators (typo) ==

There is a typo in item #1 describing the shift operators. I'd fix it myself, but I can't quite figure out what it's trying to say. [[User:Kmote|Kmote]] ([[User talk:Kmote|talk]]) 16:39, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

== m_ThreadReceiver.compare(name)==0 ==
An unregistered user is having difficulties understanding why this solution when dealing with const char *name is superior. I have attempted to explain that since in this method we are dealing with two different types of variables the use of the std:string.compare guarantees that the code will perform for every possible value.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:47, 19 March 2011 (UTC)
:That doesn't make sense. What is &quot;perform for every possible value&quot;? (Do you think it would work for some values and not others? I have the most trouble understanding this part of your statement, because in C++, for an operator involving a class, it either doesn't compile at all, or if it does, then somebody explicitly implemented an operator overload, in which case they designed it to always work.) And what does this have to do with the fact that they are two different types? In the preceding &lt;code&gt;isFor&lt;/code&gt; method, that takes a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;, why are you willing to use &lt;code&gt;m_ThreadReceiver == name&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;m_ThreadReceiver.compare(name)==0&lt;/code&gt; instead? Why the inconsistency? Perhaps you are just familiar with some string operators and not others. If that is the case, let me inform you: all the relational operators work the same for two &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt;, as it does for a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; and a C string. --[[Special:Contributions/98.210.210.193|98.210.210.193]] ([[User talk:98.210.210.193|discuss]]) 20:08, 19 March 2011 (UTC)
::Did you try to pass a char* name = NULL as an argument using simply the m_ThreadReceiver == name as I indicated ? It breaks the method doesn't it? &lt;s&gt;So it becomes evident that by using the m_ThreadReceiver.compare(name)==0 you guarantee type safety without any specific cost, and so it is a superior solution.&lt;/s&gt;
::Your proposed change would work most of the time and depending on the implementation and guarantees you could happily live with that limitation, but as teaching material we should aim to provide the best option and permit clear understanding. &lt;s&gt;Consistency is important but in this particular situation it doesn't apply since the method is target to a specific and different input.&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:27, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

==== So what is Tcl? ====

The name Tcl is derived from &quot;Tool Command Language&quot; and is pronounced &quot;tickle&quot;. Tcl is a radically simple open-source interpreted programming language that provides common facilities such as variables, procedures, and control structures as well as many useful features that are not found in any other major language. Tcl runs on almost all modern operating systems such as Unix, Macintosh, and Windows (including Windows Mobile). 

While Tcl is flexible enough to be used in almost any application imaginable, it does excel in a few key areas, including: automated interaction with external programs, embedding as a library into application programs, language design, and general scripting. 

Tcl was created in 1988 by John Ousterhout and is distributed under a BSD style [http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/license_terms.html license] (which allows you everything GPL does, plus closing your source code). The current stable version, in February 2008, is 8.5.1 (8.4.18 in the older 8.4 branch).

The first major GUI extension that works with Tcl is Tk, a toolkit that aims to rapid GUI development. That is why Tcl is now more commonly called Tcl/Tk.

The language features far-reaching introspection, and the syntax, while [http://wiki.tcl.tk/10259 simple], is very different from the Fortran/Algol/C++/Java world. Although Tcl is a string based language there are quite a few object-oriented extensions for it like [http://tmml.sourceforge.net/doc/tcllib/snitfaq.html Snit], [http://incrtcl.sourceforge.net/itcl/ incr Tcl], and [http://media.wu-wien.ac.at/ XOTcl] to name a few.

Tcl was originally developed as a reusable command language for experimental computer aided design (CAD) tools. The interpreter is implemented as a C library that could be linked into any application. It is very easy to add new functions to the Tcl interpreter, so it is an ideal reusable &quot;macro language&quot; that can be integrated into many applications. 

However, Tcl is a programming language in its own right, which can be roughly described as a cross-breed between
* LISP/Scheme (mainly for it's tail-recursion capabilities),
* C (control structure keywords, expr syntax) and 
* Unix shells (but with more powerful structuring).

==== One language, many styles ====

Although a language where &quot;everything is a command&quot; appears like it must be &quot;imperative&quot; and &quot;procedural&quot;, the flexibility of Tcl allows one to use functional or object-oriented styles of programming very easily. See &quot;Tcl examples&quot; below for ideas what one can do.

Also, it is very easy to implement other programming languages (be they (reverse) polish notation, or whatever) in Tcl for experimenting. One might call Tcl a &quot;CS Lab&quot;. For instance, here's how to compute the average of a list of numbers in Tcl (implementing a J-like functional language - see ''Tacit programming'' below):
 Def mean = fork /. sum llength

or, in a RPN language similar to FORTH or Postscript,
 mean  dup sum swap size double / ;

while a more traditional, &quot;procedural&quot; approach would be
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc mean list {
   set sum 0.
   foreach element $list {set sum [expr {$sum + $element}]}
   return [expr {$sum / [llength $list]}]
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


Here is yet another style (not very fast on long lists, but depends on nothing but Tcl). It works by building up an expression, where the elements of the lists are joined with a plus sign, and then evaluating that:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc mean list {expr double([join $list +])/[llength $list]}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

From Tcl 8.5, with math operators exposed as commands, and the expand operator, this style is better:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc mean list {expr {[tcl::mathop::+ {*}$list]/double([llength $list])}}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

or, if you have imported the tcl::mathop operators, just
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc mean list {expr {[+ {*}$list]/double([llength $list])}}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Note that all of these are in Tcl, just that the first two require some additional code to implement ''Def'' resp. ':'

A more practical aspect is that Tcl is very open for &quot;language-oriented programming&quot; - when solving a problem, specify a (little) language which most simply describes and solves that problem - then go implement that language...

==== Why should I use Tcl? ====
Good question. The general recommendation is: &quot;Use the best tool for the job&quot;. A good craftsman has a good set of tools, and knows how to use them best.

Tcl is a competitor to other scripting languages like awk, Perl, Python, PHP, Visual Basic, Lua, Ruby, and whatever else will come along. Each of these has strengths and weaknesses, and when some are similar in suitability, it finally becomes a matter of taste.

Points in favour of Tcl are:
* simplest syntax (which can be easily extended)
* cross-platform availability: Mac, Unix, Windows, ...
* strong internationalization support: everything is a Unicode string
* robust, well-tested code base
* the Tk GUI toolkit speaks Tcl natively
* BSD license, which allows open-source use like GPL, as well as closed-source
* a very helpful community, reachable via newsgroup, Wiki, or chat :)

Tcl is not the best solution for every problem. It is however a valuable experience to find out what is possible with Tcl.

==== Example: a tiny web server ====

Before spoon-feeding the bits and pieces of Tcl, a slightly longer example might be appropriate, just so you get the feeling how it looks. The following is, in 41 lines of code, a complete little web server that serves static content (HTML pages, images), but also provides a subset of CGI functionality: if an URL ends with ''.tcl'', a Tcl interpreter is called with it, and the results (a dynamically generated HTML page) served. 

Note that no extension package was needed - Tcl can, with the '''socket''' command, do such tasks already pretty nicely. A socket is a channel that can be written to with '''puts'''. The '''fcopy''' copies asynchronously (in the background) from one channel to another, where the source is either a process pipe (the &quot;exec tclsh&quot; part) or an open file.

This server was tested to work pretty well even on 200MHz Windows 95 over a 56k modem, and serving several clients concurrently. Also, because of the brevity of the code, this is an educational example for how (part of) HTTP works.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
# DustMotePlus - with a subset of CGI support
set root      c:/html
set default   index.htm
set port      80
set encoding  iso8859-1
proc bgerror msg {puts stdout &quot;bgerror: $msg\n$::errorInfo&quot;}
proc answer {sock host2 port2} {
    fileevent $sock readable [list serve $sock]
}
proc serve sock {
    fconfigure $sock -blocking 0
    gets $sock line
    if {[fblocked $sock]} {
        return
    }
    fileevent $sock readable &quot;&quot;
    set tail /
    regexp {(/[^ ?]*)(\?[^ ]*)?} $line -&gt; tail args
    if {[string match */ $tail]} {
        append tail $::default
    }
    set name [string map {%20 &quot; &quot; .. NOTALLOWED} $::root$tail]
    if {[file readable $name]} {
        puts $sock &quot;HTTP/1.0 200 OK&quot;
        if {[file extension $name] eq &quot;.tcl&quot;} {
            set ::env(QUERY_STRING) [string range $args 1 end]
            set name [list |tclsh $name]
        } else {
            puts $sock &quot;Content-Type: text/html;charset=$::encoding\n&quot;
        }
        set inchan [open $name]
        fconfigure $inchan -translation binary
        fconfigure $sock   -translation binary
        fcopy $inchan $sock -command [list done $inchan $sock]
    } else {
        puts $sock &quot;HTTP/1.0 404 Not found\n&quot;
        close $sock
    }
}
proc done {file sock bytes {msg {}}} {
    close $file
    close $sock
}
socket -server answer $port
puts &quot;Server ready...&quot;
vwait forever
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

And here's a little &quot;CGI&quot; script I tested it with (save as time.tcl):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
# time.tcl - tiny CGI script.
if {![info exists env(QUERY_STRING)]} {
    set env(QUERY_STRING) &quot;&quot;
}
puts &quot;Content-type: text/html\n&quot;
puts &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Tiny CGI time server&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Time server&lt;/h1&gt;
Time now is: [clock format [clock seconds]]
&lt;br&gt;
Query was: $env(QUERY_STRING)
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;a href=index.htm&gt;Index&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== Where to get Tcl/Tk ====
On most Linux systems, Tcl/Tk is already installed. You can find out by typing ''tclsh'' at a console prompt (xterm or such). If a &quot;%&quot; prompt appears, you're already set. Just to make sure, type ''info pa'' at the % prompt to see the patchlevel (e.g. 8.4.9) and ''info na'' to see where the executable is located in the file system.

Tcl is an open source project. The sources are available from http://tcl.sourceforge.net/ if you want to build it yourself.

For all major platforms, you can download a binary '''ActiveTcl''' distribution from [http://www.activestate.com/Products/Download/Download.plex?id=ActiveTcl ActiveState]. Besides Tcl and Tk, this also contains many popular extensions - it's called the canonical &quot;Batteries Included&quot; distribution.

Alternatively, you can get [http://www.equi4.com/tclkit.html Tclkit]: a Tcl/Tk installation wrapped in a single file, which you don't need to unwrap. When run, the file mounts itself as a virtual file system, allowing access to all its parts.

January 2006, saw the release of a new and promising one-file vfs distribution of Tcl; '''eTcl'''. Free binaries for Linux, Windows, and Windows Mobile 2003 can be downloaded from http://www.evolane.com/software/etcl/index.html . Especially on PocketPCs, this provides several features that have so far been missing from other ports: sockets, window &quot;retreat&quot;, and can be extended by providing a startup script, and by installing pure-Tcl libraries.

==== First steps ====

To see whether your installation works, you might save the following text to a file ''hello.tcl'' and run it (type ''tclsh hello.tcl'' at a console on Linux, double-click on Windows):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
package require Tk
pack [label .l -text &quot;Hello world!&quot;]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It should bring up a little grey window with the greeting.

To make a script directly executable (on Unix/Linux, and Cygwin on Windows), use this first line (the # being flush left):
 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env tclsh
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

or (in an older, deprecated tricky style):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
#! /bin/sh
# the next line restarts using tclsh \
exec tclsh &quot;$0&quot; ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This way, the shell can determine which executable to run the script with.

An even simpler way, and highly recommended for beginners as well as experienced users, is to start up tclsh or wish interactively. You will see a % prompt in the console, can type commands to it, and watch its responses. Even error messages are very helpful here, and don't cause a program abort - don't be afraid to try whatever you like! Example:
 $ tclsh
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;info patchlevel&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
 8.4.12
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;expr 6*7&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
 42
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;expr 42/0&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
 divide by zero
You can even write programs interactively, best as one-liners:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc ! x {expr {$x&lt;=2? $x: $x*[! [incr x -1]]}}
! 5
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Syntax ===
Syntax is just the rules how a language is structured. A simple syntax of English could say (ignoring punctuation for the moment):
* A text consists of one or more sentences
* A sentence consists of one or more words
Simple as this is, it also describes Tcl's syntax very well - if you say &quot;script&quot; for &quot;text&quot;, and &quot;command&quot; for &quot;sentence&quot;. There's also the difference that a Tcl word can again contain a script or a command. So

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
if {$x &lt; 0} {set x 0}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

is a command consisting of three words: ''if'', a condition in braces, a command (also consisting of three words) in braces.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
Take this for example
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

is a well-formed Tcl command: it calls ''Take'' (which must have been defined before) with the three arguments &quot;this&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, and &quot;example&quot;. It is up to the command how it interprets its arguments, e.g.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
puts acos(-1)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

will write the string &quot;acos(-1)&quot; to the stdout channel, and return the empty string &quot;&quot;, while

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
expr acos(-1)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

will compute the arc cosine of -1 and return 3.14159265359 (an approximation of ''Pi''), or

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
string length acos(-1)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

will invoke the ''string'' command, which again dispatches to its ''length'' sub-command, which determines the length of the second argument and returns 8.

==== Quick summary ====
A Tcl '''script''' is a string that is a sequence of commands, separated by newlines or semicolons.

A '''command''' is a string that is a list of words, separated by blanks. The first word is the name of the command, the other words are passed to it as its arguments. In Tcl, ''&quot;everything is a command&quot;'' - even what in other languages would be called declaration, definition, or control structure. A command can interpret its arguments in any way it wants - in particular, it can implement a different language, like ''expr''.

A '''word''' is a string that is a simple word, or one that begins with { and ends with the matching } (braces), or one that begins with &quot; and ends with the matching &quot;. Braced words are not evaluated by the parser. In quoted words, substitutions can occur before the command is called:
* $[A-Za-z0-9_]+ substitutes the value of the given variable. Or, if the variable name contains characters outside that regular expression, another layer of bracing helps the parser to get it right:
 puts &quot;Guten Morgen, ${Schüler}!&quot;
If the code would say ''$Schüler'', this would be parsed as the value of variable ''$Sch'', immediately followed by the constant string ''üler''.

* (Part of) a word can be an embedded script: a string in [] brackets whose contents are evaluated as a script (see above) before the current command is called.

In short: Scripts and commands contain words. Words can again contain scripts and commands. (This can lead to words more than a page long...)

Arithmetic and logic expressions are not part of the Tcl language itself, but the language of the '''expr''' command (also used in some arguments of the '''if''', '''for''', '''while''' commands) is basically equivalent to C's expressions, with infix operators and functions. See separate chapter on ''expr'' below.

==== The man page: 11 rules ====

Here is the complete manpage for Tcl (8.4) with the &quot;endekalogue&quot;, the 11 rules. (From 8.5 onward there is a twelfth rule regarding the {*} feature).

The following rules define the syntax and semantics of the Tcl language: 

'''(1) Commands''' 
A Tcl script is a string containing one or more commands. Semi-colons and newlines are command separators unless quoted as described below. Close brackets are command terminators during command substitution (see below) unless quoted. 

'''(2) Evaluation'''
A command is evaluated in two steps. First, the Tcl interpreter breaks the command into words and performs substitutions as described below. These substitutions are performed in the same way for all commands. The first word is used to locate a command procedure to carry out the command, then all of the words of the command are passed to the command procedure. The command procedure is free to interpret each of its words in any way it likes, such as an integer, variable name, list, or Tcl script. Different commands interpret their words differently. 

'''(3) Words'''
Words of a command are separated by white space (except for newlines, which are command separators). 

'''(4) Double quotes'''
If the first character of a word is double-quote (&quot;) then the word is terminated by the next double-quote character. If semi-colons, close brackets, or white space characters (including newlines) appear between the quotes then they are treated as ordinary characters and included in the word. Command substitution, variable substitution, and backslash substitution are performed on the characters between the quotes as described below. The double-quotes are not retained as part of the word. 

'''(5) Braces'''
If the first character of a word is an open brace ({) then the word is terminated by the matching close brace (}). Braces nest within the word: for each additional open brace there must be an additional close brace (however, if an open brace or close brace within the word is quoted with a backslash then it is not counted in locating the matching close brace). No substitutions are performed on the characters between the braces except for backslash-newline substitutions described below, nor do semi-colons, newlines, close brackets, or white space receive any special interpretation. The word will consist of exactly the characters between the outer braces, not including the braces themselves. 

'''(6) Command substitution'''
If a word contains an open bracket ([) then Tcl performs command substitution. To do this it invokes the Tcl interpreter recursively to process the characters following the open bracket as a Tcl script. The script may contain any number of commands and must be terminated by a close bracket (``]''). The result of the script (i.e. the result of its last command) is substituted into the word in place of the brackets and all of the characters between them. There may be any number of command substitutions in a single word. Command substitution is not performed on words enclosed in braces. 

'''(7) Variable substitution'''
If a word contains a dollar-sign ($) then Tcl performs variable substitution: the dollar-sign and the following characters are replaced in the word by the value of a variable. Variable substitution may take any of the following forms: 

$name 

Name is the name of a scalar variable; the name is a sequence of one or more characters that are a letter, digit, underscore, or namespace separators (two or more colons). 

$name(index) 

Name gives the name of an array variable and index gives the name of an element within that array. Name must contain only letters, digits, underscores, and namespace separators, and may be an empty string. Command substitutions, variable substitutions, and backslash substitutions are performed on the characters of index. 

${name} 

Name is the name of a scalar variable. It may contain any characters whatsoever except for close braces. 
There may be any number of variable substitutions in a single word. Variable substitution is not performed on words enclosed in braces.

'''(8) Backslash substitution'''
If a backslash (\) appears within a word then backslash substitution occurs. In all cases but those described below the backslash is dropped and the following character is treated as an ordinary character and included in the word. This allows characters such as double quotes, close brackets, and dollar signs to be included in words without triggering special processing. The following table lists the backslash sequences that are handled specially, along with the value that replaces each sequence. 
;\a 
:Audible alert (bell) (0x7). 
;\b 
:Backspace (0x8). 
;\f 
:Form feed (0xc). 
;\n 
:Newline (0xa). 
;\r 
:Carriage-return (0xd). 
;\t 
:Tab (0x9). 
;\v 
:Vertical tab (0xb). 
;\&lt;newline&gt;whiteSpace 
:A single space character replaces the backslash, newline, and all spaces and tabs after the newline. This backslash sequence is unique in that it is replaced in a separate pre-pass before the command is actually parsed. This means that it will be replaced even when it occurs between braces, and the resulting space will be treated as a word separator if it isn't in braces or quotes. 
;\\ 
:Literal backslash (\), no special effect. 
;\ooo 
:The digits ooo (one, two, or three of them) give an eight-bit octal value for the Unicode character that will be inserted. The upper bits of the Unicode character will be 0. 
;\xhh 
:The hexadecimal digits hh give an eight-bit hexadecimal value for the Unicode character that will be inserted. Any number of hexadecimal digits may be present; however, all but the last two are ignored (the result is always a one-byte quantity). The upper bits of the Unicode character will be 0. 
;\uhhhh 
:The hexadecimal digits hhhh (one, two, three, or four of them) give a sixteen-bit hexadecimal value for the Unicode character that will be inserted. 

Backslash substitution is not performed on words enclosed in braces, except for backslash-newline as described above.

'''(9) Comments'''
If a hash character (#) appears at a point where Tcl is expecting the first character of the first word of a command, then the hash character and the characters that follow it, up through the next newline, are treated as a comment and ignored. The comment character only has significance when it appears at the beginning of a command. 

'''(10) Order of substitution'''
Each character is processed exactly once by the Tcl interpreter as part of creating the words of a command. For example, if variable substitution occurs then no further substitutions are performed on the value of the variable; the value is inserted into the word verbatim. If command substitution occurs then the nested command is processed entirely by the recursive call to the Tcl interpreter; no substitutions are performed before making the recursive call and no additional substitutions are performed on the result of the nested script. 
Substitutions take place from left to right, and each substitution is evaluated completely before attempting to evaluate the next. Thus, a sequence like

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set y [set x 0][incr x][incr x]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

will always set the variable y to the value, 012. 

'''(11) Substitution and word boundaries'''
Substitutions do not affect the word boundaries of a command. For example, during variable substitution the entire value of the variable becomes part of a single word, even if the variable's value contains spaces.

==== Comments ====
The first rule for comments is simple: comments start with # where the first word of a command is expected, and continue to the end of line (which can be extended, by a trailing backslash, to the following line):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
# This is a comment \
going over three lines \
with backslash continuation
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

One of the problems new users of Tcl meet sooner or later is that comments behave in an unexpected way. For example, if you comment out part of code like this:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
# if {$condition} {
    puts &quot;condition met!&quot;
# }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This happens to work, but any unbalanced braces in comments may lead to unexpected syntax errors. The reason is that Tcl's grouping (determining word boundaries) happens before the # characters are considered.

To add a comment behind a command on the same line, just add a semicolon:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
puts &quot;this is the command&quot; ;# that is the comment
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Comments are only taken as such where a command is expected. In data (like the comparison values in '''switch'''), a # is just a literal character:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
if $condition {# good place
   switch -- $x {
       #bad_place {because switch tests against it}
       some_value {do something; # good place again}
   }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To comment out multiple lines of code, it is easiest to use &quot;if 0&quot;:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
if 0 {
    puts &quot;This code will not be executed&quot;
    This block is never parsed, so can contain almost any code
    - except unbalanced braces :)
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Data types ===

In Tcl, all values are strings, and the phrase &quot;'''Everything is a string'''&quot; is often used to illustrate this fact.  But just as &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt; can be used in can be interpreted in English as &quot;the number 2&quot; or &quot;the character representing the number 2&quot;, two different functions in Tcl can interpret the same value in two different ways.  The command &lt;code&gt;expr&lt;/code&gt;, for example, interprets &quot;2&quot; as a number, but the command &lt;code&gt;string length&lt;code&gt; interprets &quot;2&quot; as a single character.  All values in Tcl can be interpreted either as characters or something else that the characters represent.  The important thing to remember is that every value in Tcl is a string of characters, and each string of characters might be interpreted as something else, depending on the context.  This will become more clear in the examples below.  For performance reasons, versions of Tcl since 8.0 keep track of both the string value and how that string value was last interpreted.  This section covers the various &quot;types&quot; of things that Tcl values (strings) get interpreted as. 

==== Strings ====

A string is a sequence of zero or more characters (where all 16-bit Unicodes are accepted in almost all situations, see in more detail below). The size of strings is automatically administered, so you only have to worry about that if the string length exceeds the virtual memory size.

In contrast to many other languages, strings in Tcl don't need quotes for markup.  The following is perfectly valid:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set greeting Hello!
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Quotes (or braces) are rather used for grouping:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set example &quot;this is one word&quot;
set another {this is another}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The difference is that inside quotes, substitutions (like of variables,
embedded commands, or backslashes) are performed, while in braces, they are not
(similar to single quotes in shells, but nestable):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set amount 42
puts &quot;You owe me $amount&quot; ;#--&gt; You owe me 42
puts {You owe me $amount} ;#--&gt; You owe me $amount
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In source code, quoted or braced strings can span multiple lines, and the
physical newlines are part of the string too:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set test &quot;hello
world
in three lines&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To '''reverse a string''', we let an index ''i'' first point at its end, and
decrementing ''i'' until it's zero, append the indexed character to the end of
the result ''res'':

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc sreverse str {
set res &quot;&quot;
for {set i [string length $str]} {$i &gt; 0} {} {
    append res [string index $str [incr i -1]]
} 
set res
}

sreverse &quot;A man, a plan, a canal - Panama&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
amanaP - lanac a ,nalp a ,nam A
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;


'''Hex-dumping''' a string:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc hexdump string {
    binary scan $string H* hex
    regexp -all -inline .. $hex
}

hexdump hello
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
68 65 6c 6c 6f
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;

'''Finding a substring''' in a string can be done in various ways:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
string first  $substr  $str ;# returns the position from 0, or -1 if not found
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
string match *$substr* $str ;# returns 1 if found, 0 if not
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
regexp $substr  $str ;# the same
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The matching is done with exact match in ''string first'', with glob-style
match in ''string match'', and as a regular expression in ''regexp''. If there
are characters in ''substr'' that are special to ''glob'' or regular
expressions, using ''string first'' is recommended.

==== Lists ====

Many strings are also well-formed '''lists'''. Every simple word is a list of length one, and elements of longer lists are separated by whitespace. For instance, a string that corresponds to a list of three elements:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set example {foo bar grill}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Strings with unbalanced quotes or braces, or non-space characters directly following closing braces, cannot be parsed as lists directly. You can explicitly '''split''' them to make a list.

The &quot;constructor&quot; for lists is of course called ''list''. It's recommended to use when elements come from variable or command substitution (braces won't do that). As Tcl commands are lists anyway, the following is a full substitute for the ''list'' command:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc list args {set args}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Lists can contain lists again, to any depth, which makes modelling of matrixes
and trees easy. Here's a string that represents a 4 x 4 unit matrix as a list
of lists.  The outer braces group the entire thing into one string, which
includes the literal inner braces and whitespace, including the literal
newlines.  The list parser then interprets the inner braces as delimiting
nested lists.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
{{1 0 0 0}
 {0 1 0 0}
 {0 0 1 0}
 {0 0 0 1}}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The newlines are valid list element separators, too.

Tcl's list operations are demonstrated in some examples:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set      x {foo bar}
llength  $x        ;#--&gt; 2
lappend  x  grill  ;#--&gt; foo bar grill
lindex   $x 1      ;#--&gt; bar (indexing starts at 0)
lsearch  $x grill  ;#--&gt; 2 (the position, counting from 0)
lsort    $x        ;#--&gt; bar foo grill
linsert  $x 2 and  ;#--&gt; foo bar and grill
lreplace $x 1 1 bar, ;#--&gt; foo bar, and grill 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


To change an element of a list (of a list...) in place, the '''lset''' command
is useful - just give as many indexes as needed:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set test {{a b} {c d}}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
{a b} {c d}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
lset test 1 1 x
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
{a b} {c x}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

The '''lindex''' command also takes multiple indexes:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
lindex $test 1 1
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
x
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

Example: To find out whether an element is contained in a list (from Tcl 8.5, there's the '''in''' operator for that):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc in {list el} {expr {[lsearch -exact $list $el] &gt;= 0}}
in {a b c} b
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
1
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
in {a b c} d
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
#ignore this line, which is only here because there is currently a bug in wikibooks rendering which makes the 0 on the following line disappear when it is alone 
0
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

Example: remove an element from a list variable by value (converse to lappend), if present:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc lremove {_list el} {
  upvar 1 $_list list
  set pos [lsearch -exact $list $el]
  set list [lreplace $list $pos $pos]
}

set t {foo bar grill}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
foo bar grill
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
lremove t bar
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
foo grill
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set t
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
foo grill
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

A simpler alternative, which also removes all occurrences of ''el'':

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc lremove {_list el} {
  upvar 1 $_list list
  set list [lsearch -all -inline -not -exact $list $el]
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Example: To draw a random element from a list L, we first determine its length (using ''llength''), multiply that with a random number &gt; 0.0 and &lt; 1.0, truncate that to integer (so it lies between 0 and length-1), and use that for indexing (''lindex'') into the list:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc ldraw L {
   lindex $L [expr {int(rand()*[llength $L])}]
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Example: Transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns), using integers as generated variable names:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc transpose matrix {
   foreach row $matrix {
       set i 0
       foreach el $row {lappend [incr i] $el}
   }
   set res {}
   set i 0
   foreach e [lindex $matrix 0] {lappend res [set [incr i]]}
   set res
}

transpose {{1 2} {3 4} {5 6}}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
{1 3 5} {2 4 6}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

Example: pretty-printing a list of lists which represents a table:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc fmtable table {
   set maxs {}
   foreach item [lindex $table 0] {
       lappend maxs [string length $item]
   }
   foreach row [lrange $table 1 end] {
       set i 0
       foreach item $row max $maxs {
           if {[string length $item]&gt;$max} {
               lset maxs $i [string length $item]
           }
           incr i
       }
   }
   set head +
   foreach max $maxs {append head -[string repeat - $max]-+}
   set res $head\n
   foreach row $table {
       append res |
       foreach item $row max $maxs {append res [format &quot; %-${max}s |&quot; $item]}
       append res \n
   }
   append res $head
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Testing:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
fmtable {
   {1 short &quot;long field content&quot;}
   {2 &quot;another long one&quot; short}
   {3 &quot;&quot; hello}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
+---+------------------+--------------------+
| 1 | short            | long field content |
| 2 | another long one | short              |
| 3 |                  | hello              |
+---+------------------+--------------------+
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

'''Enumerations:''' Lists can also be used to implement enumerations (mappings from symbols to non-negative integers). Example for a nice wrapper around lsearch/lindex:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc makeEnum {name values} {
   interp alias {} $name: {} lsearch $values
   interp alias {} $name@ {} lindex $values
}

makeEnum fruit {apple blueberry cherry date elderberry}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This assigns &quot;apple&quot; to 0, &quot;blueberry&quot; to 1, etc.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
fruit: date
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
3
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
fruit@ 2
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
cherry
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

==== Numbers ====

Numbers are strings that can be parsed as such. Tcl supports integers (32-bit or even 64-bit wide) and &quot;double&quot; floating-point numbers. From Tcl 8.5 on, bignums (integers of arbitrarily large precision) are supported. Arithmetics is done with the '''expr''' command, which takes basically the same syntax of operators (including ternary ''x?y:z''), parens, and math functions as C. See below for detailed discussion of ''expr''.

Control the display format of numbers with the '''format''' command which does appropriate rounding:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
expr 2/3.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
0.666666666667
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
format %.2f [expr 2/3.]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
0.67
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

Up to the 8.4 version (the present version is 8.5), Tcl honored the C convention that an integer starting with 0 is parsed as octal, so
 0377 == 0xFF == 255
This changes in 8.5, though - too often people stumbled over &quot;08&quot; meant as hour or month, raised a syntax error, because 8 is no valid octal number. In the future you'd have to write 0o377 if you really mean octal.
You can do number base conversions with the ''format'' command, where the format is %x for hex, %d for decimal, %o for octal, and the input number should have the C-like markup to indicate its base:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
format %x 255
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
ff
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
format %d 0xff
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
255
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
format %o 255
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
377
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
format %d 0377
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
255
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

Variables with integer value can be most efficiently modified with the ''incr'' command:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
incr i    ;# default increment is 1
incr j 2
incr i -1 ;# decrement with negative value
incr j $j ;# double the value
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The maximal positive integer can be determined from the hexadecimal form, with a 7 in front, followed by several &quot;F&quot; characters. Tcl 8.4 can use &quot;wide integers&quot; of 64 bits, and the maximum integer there is

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
expr 0x7fffffffffffffff
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
9223372036854775807
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

Demonstration: one more, and it turns into the minimum integer:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
expr 0x8000000000000000
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
-9223372036854775808
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

'''Bignums''': from Tcl 8.5, integers can be of arbitrary size, so there is no
maximum integer anymore. Say, you want a big factorial:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc tcl::mathfunc::fac x {expr {$x &lt; 2? 1: $x * fac($x-1)}}

expr fac(100)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

'''IEEE special floating-point values''': Also from 8.5, Tcl supports a few
special values for floating-point numbers, namely ''Inf'' (infinity) and ''NaN
(Not a Number):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set i [expr 1/0.]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Inf
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
expr {$i+$i}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Inf
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
expr {$i+1 == $i}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
1
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set j NaN ;# special because it isn't equal to itself
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
NaN
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
expr {$j == $j}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
#ignore this line, which is only here because there is currently a bug in wikibooks rendering which makes the 0 on the following line disappear when it is alone 
0
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

==== Booleans ====

Tcl supports booleans as numbers in a similar fashion to C, with 0 being false and any other number being true. It also supports them as the strings &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; and few others (see below). The canonical &quot;true&quot; value (as returned by Boolean expressions) is 1.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
foreach b {0 1 2 13 true false on off no yes n y a} {puts &quot;$b -&gt; [expr {$b?1:0}]&quot;}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
0 -&gt; 0
1 -&gt; 1
2 -&gt; 1
13 -&gt; 1
true -&gt; 1
false -&gt; 0
on -&gt; 1
off -&gt; 0
no -&gt; 0
yes -&gt; 1
n -&gt; 0
y -&gt; 1
expected boolean value but got &quot;a&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

==== Characters ====

Characters are abstractions of writing elements (e.g. letters, digits, punctuation characters, Chinese ideographs, ligatures...). In Tcl since 8.1, characters are internally represented with Unicode, which can be seen as unsigned integers between 0 and 65535 (recent Unicode versions have even crossed that boundary, but the Tcl implementation currently uses a maximum of 16 bits). Any Unicode U+XXXX can be specified as a character constant with an \uXXXX escape. It is recommended to only use ASCII characters (\u0000-\u007f) in Tcl scripts directly, and escape all others.

Convert between numeric Unicode and characters with

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set char [format %c $int]
set int  [scan $char %c]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Watch out that int values above 65535 produce 'decreasing' characters again, while negative int even produces two bogus characters. format does not warn, so better test before calling it.

Sequences of characters are called strings (see above). There is no special
data type for a single character, so a single character is just a string on
length 1 (everything is a string). In UTF-8, which is used internally by Tcl,
the encoding of a single character may take from one to three bytes of space.
To determine the bytelength of a single character:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
string bytelength $c ;# assuming [string length $c]==1
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

String routines can be applied to single characters too, e.g [string toupper]
etc. Find out whether a character is in a given set (a character string) with

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
expr {[string first $char $set]&gt;=0}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

As Unicodes for characters fall in distinct ranges, checking whether a
character's code lies within a range allows a more-or-less rough classification
of its category:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc inRange {from to char} {
    # generic range checker
    set int [scan $char %c]
    expr {$int&gt;=$from &amp;&amp; $int &lt;= $to}
}
interp alias {} isGreek {}    inRange 0x0386 0x03D6
interp alias {} isCyrillic {} inRange 0x0400 0x04F9
interp alias {} isHangul {}   inRange 0xAC00 0xD7A3
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This is a useful helper to convert all characters beyond the ASCII set to their \u.... escapes (so the resulting string is strict ASCII):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc u2x s {
   set res &quot;&quot;
   foreach c [split $s &quot;&quot;] {
     scan $c %c int
     append res [expr {$int&lt;128? $c :&quot;\\u[format %04.4X $int]&quot;}]
   }
   set res
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== Internal representation ====

In the main Tcl implementation, which is written in C, each value has both a
string representation (UTF-8 encoded) and a structured representation.  This is
an implementation detail which allows for better performance, but has no
semantic impact on the language.  Tcl tracks both representations, making sure
that if one is changed, the other one is updated to reflect the change the next
time it is used.  For example, if the string representation of a value is &quot;8&quot;,
and the value was last used as a number in an [expr] command, the structured
representation will be a numeric type like a signed integer or a
double-precision floating point number.  If the value &quot;one two three&quot; was last
used in one of the list commands, the structured representation will be a list
structure.  There are various other &quot;types&quot; on the C side which may be used as
the structured representation. As of Tcl 8.5, only the most recent structured
representation of a value is stored, and it is replaced with a different
representation when necessary.  This &quot;dual-porting&quot; of values helps avoid, repeated parsing or &quot;stringification&quot;, which otherwise would happen often because each time a value is encountered in source code, it is interpreted as a string prior to being interpreted in its current context.
But to the programmer, the view that &quot;everything is a string&quot; is
still maintained.

These values are stored in reference-counted structures termed objects (a term
that has many meanings). From the perspective of all code that uses values (as
opposed to code implementing a particular representation), they are immutable.
In practice, this is implemented using a copy-on-write strategy.

=== Variables ===

Variables can be local or global, and scalar or array. Their names can be any string not containing a colon (which is reserved for use in namespace separators) but for the convenience of $-dereference one usually uses names of the pattern &lt;nowiki&gt;[A-Za-z0-9_]+&lt;/nowiki&gt;, i.e. one or more letters, digits, or underscores.

Variables need not be declared beforehand. They are created when first assigned a value, if they did not exist before, and can be unset when no longer needed:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set foo    42     ;# creates the scalar variable foo
set bar(1) grill  ;# creates the array bar and its element 1
set baz    $foo   ;# assigns to baz the value of foo
set baz [set foo] ;# the same effect
info exists foo   ;# returns 1 if the variable foo exists, else 0
unset foo         ;# deletes the variable foo
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Retrieving a variable's value with the $foo notation is only syntactic sugar for [set foo]. The latter is more powerful though, as it can be nested, for deeper dereferencing:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set foo   42
set bar   foo
set grill bar
puts [set [set [set grill]]] ;# gives 42
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Some people might expect ''$$$grill'' to deliver the same result, but it doesn't, because of the Tcl parser. When it encounters the first and second $ sign, it tries to find a variable name (consisting of one or more letters, digits, or underscores) in vain, so these $ signs are left literally as they are. The third $ allows substitution of the variable ''grill'', but no backtracking to the previous $'s takes place. So the evaluation result of ''$$$grill'' is ''$$bar''. Nested [set] commands give the user more control.

==== Local vs. global ====

A local variable exists only in the procedure where it is defined, and is freed as soon as the procedure finishes. By default, all variables used in a proc are local.

Global variables exist outside of procedures, as long as they are not explicitly unset. They may be needed for long-living data, or implicit  communication between different procedures, but in general it's safer and more efficient to use globals as sparingly as possible. Example of a very simple bank with only one account:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
 set balance 0 ;# this creates and initializes a global variable

 proc deposit {amount} {
    global balance
    set balance [expr {$balance + $amount}]
 }

 proc withdraw {amount} {
    set ::balance [expr {$::balance - $amount}]
 }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This illustrates two ways of referring to global variables - either with the '''global''' command, or by qualifying the variable name with the :: prefix. The variable ''amount'' is local in both procedures, and its value is that of the first argument to the respective procedure.

Introspection:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
info vars ;#-- lists all visible variables
info locals
info globals
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To make all global variables visible in a procedure (not recommended):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
eval global [info globals]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== Scalar vs. array ====
All of the value types discussed above in ''Data types'' can be put into a scalar variable, which is the normal kind.

Arrays are collections of variables, indexed by a key that can be any string, and in fact implemented as hash tables. What other languages call &quot;arrays&quot; (vectors of values indexed by an integer), would in Tcl rather be lists. Some illustrations:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
#-- The key is specified in parens after the array name
set         capital(France) Paris

#-- The key can also be substituted from a variable:
set                  country France
puts       $capital($country)

#-- Setting several elements at once:
array set   capital         {Italy Rome  Germany Berlin}

#-- Retrieve all keys:
array names capital    ;#-- Germany Italy France -- quasi-random order

#-- Retrieve keys matching a glob pattern:
array names capital F* ;#-- France 
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A fanciful array name is &quot;&quot; (the empty string, therefore we might call this the &quot;anonymous array&quot; :) which makes nice reading:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set (example) 1
puts $(example)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Note that arrays themselves are not values. They can be passed in and out of procedures not as ''$capital'' (which would try to retrieve the value), but by reference. The '''dict''' type (available from Tcl 8.5) might be better suited for these purposes, while otherwise providing hash table functionality, too.

==== System variables ====
At startup, tclsh provides the following global variables:
; argc : number of arguments on the command line
; argv : list of the arguments on the command line
; argv0 : name of the executable or script (first word on command line)
; auto_index : array with instructions from where to load further commands
; auto_oldpath : (same as auto_path ?)
; auto_path : list of paths to search for packages
; env : array, mirrors the environment variables
; errorCode : type of the last error, or {}, e.g. ARITH DIVZERO {divide by zero}
; errorInfo : last error message, or {}
; tcl_interactive : 1 if interpreter is interactive, else 0
; tcl_libPath : list of library paths
; tcl_library : path of the Tcl system library directory
; tcl_patchLevel : detailed version number, e.g. 8.4.11
; tcl_platform : array with information on the operating system
; tcl_rcFileName : name of the initial resource file 
; tcl_version : brief version number, e.g. 8.4

One can use temporary environment variables to control a Tcl script from the command line, at least in Unixoid systems including Cygwin. Example scriptlet:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set foo 42
if [info exists env(DO)] {eval $env(DO)}
puts foo=$foo
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This script will typically report

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
 foo=42
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

To remote-control it without editing, set the DO variable before the call:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
DO='set foo 4711' tclsh myscript.tcl
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

which will evidently report

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
foo=4711
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

==== Dereferencing variables ====

A ''reference'' is something that refers, or points, to another something (if you pardon the scientific expression). In C, references are done with *pointers* (memory addresses); in Tcl, references are strings (everything is a string), namely names of variables, which via a hash table can be resolved (dereferenced) to the &quot;other something&quot; they point to:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
puts foo       ;# just the string foo
puts $foo      ;# dereference variable with name of foo
puts [set foo] ;# the same
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

This can be done more than one time with nested set commands. Compare the following C and Tcl programs, that do the same (trivial) job, and exhibit remarkable similarity:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {
  int    i =      42;
  int *  ip =     &amp;i;
  int ** ipp =   &amp;ip;
  int ***ippp = &amp;ipp;
  printf(&quot;hello, %d\n&quot;, ***ippp);
  return 0;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

...and Tcl:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
set i    42
set ip   i
set ipp  ip
set ippp ipp
puts &quot;hello, [set [set [set [set ippp]]]]&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The asterisks in C correspond to calls to &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; in Tcl dereferencing.   There is no corresponding operator to the C &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; because, in Tcl, special markup is not needed in declaring references.  The correspondence is not perfect; there are four &lt;code&gt;set&lt;/code&gt; calls and only three asterisks.  This is because mentioning a variable in C is an implicit dereference.  In this case, the dereference is used to pass its value into printf.  Tcl makes all four dereferences explicit (thus, if you only had 3 set calls, you'd see hello, i). A single dereference is used so frequently that it is typically abbreviated with $varname, e.g.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
puts &quot;hello, [set [set [set $ippp]]]&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

has set where C uses asterisks, and $ for the last (default) dereference.

The hashtable for variable names is either global, for code evaluated in that scope, or local to a proc. You can still &quot;import&quot; references to variables in scopes that are &quot;higher&quot; in the call stack, with the upvar and global commands. (The latter being automatic in C if the names are unique.  If there are identical names in C, the innermost scope wins).

==== Variable traces ====

One special feature of Tcl is that you can associate traces with variables (scalars, arrays, or array elements) that are evaluated optionally when the variable is read, written to, or unset.

Debugging is one obvious use for that. But there are more possibilities. For instance, you can introduce constants where any attempt to change their value raises an error:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;tcl&quot;&gt;
proc const {name value} {
  uplevel 1 [list set $name $value]
  uplevel 1 [list trace var $name w {error constant ;#} ]
}

const x 11
incr x
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
can't set &quot;x&quot;: constant
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

The trace callback gets three words appended: the name of the variable; the
array key (if the variable is an array, else &quot;&quot;), and the mode:

* r - read
* w - write
* u - unset

If the trace is just a single command like above, and you don't want to handle
these three, use a comment &quot;;#&quot; to shield them off.

Another possibility is tying local objects (or procs) with a variable - if the variable is unset, the object/proc is destroyed/renamed away.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Semolina|Semolina]]
* [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|Oat flakes]]
* [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]]
* optional:
** [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]]
** [[Cookbook:Maize|Maize]]
** [[Cookbook:mushroom|Champignons]]
** [[Cookbook:Leek|Leek]]
** [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|Soy sauce]]
** [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|Cornstarch]]
** Breading: [[Cookbook:bread|breading mix]], salt, pepper, optional: [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]], savory

==Procedure==
# Mix semolina with oat flakes at a ratio of 4 : 1.
# Add water and stir until you get a viscous substance. You can add spices to the substance but most spices go into the breading mix, which is where you want them to be.
# Cut onions into pieces and fry them with some oil, add maize and paprika to taste when the onions turn glassy.
# Mix the breading mix with salt, pepper and spices of your choice on a plate. Keep some of the breading mix to sprinkle it on the patties.
# Spread the substance on the breading mix in the form of burger patties.
# Sprinkle the remaining breading mix on the patties.
# Push the patties carefully on a spatula and fry them in a hot, oiled pan. If you use too much oil the patties will be soaked in fat, if you use too little the breading mix will not be fried. It's probably best to add a little bit of oil and then shuffle the patties around in the pan. The patties very quickly become robust enough so you can easily pick them up and turn them with a spatula to see if the other side had enough oil.
# You may want to
* shake off loose breading mix over the plate, so as not to put loose breading mix into the pan. 
* topple the patties into the pan.
* flatten the patties a bit with the spatula, so the breading mix on the underside touches the oiled pan everywhere.

== Variants ==
* Adding 5 to 10% of cornstarch makes the patties looser.
* You can mix semolina and oat flakes 1:1, which makes the patties more compact.
* Adding [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]] (or seitan mix) makes the patties tougher, without making them more compact.
* Without breading the patties require less oil.

[[Image:Margay_cat.jpg|thumb|A margay is at home in trees]]
'''Margays''' are the masters of vertical space, spending much of their lives in the branches of trees where they pursue their prey and even nap hanging upside down by their back feet.

==Where do margays live?==
Margays live from Mexico in the north all the way south to northern Argentina. Margays also live in rainforests. Margays used to be found in Texas, but have been hunted out all the way to southern mexico. They prefer to live in damp areas.

==What do margays look like?==
A margay has spots like a cheetah, two stripes on its forehead, and some on its cheeks. It also has thick stripes on its tail. Like a tiger's, leopard's, or cheetah's, the margay's patterns are specific to each individual. It has very large eyes and a very long tail that is 70 percent as long as its body. It can jump higher than an ocelot by 20 feet! The margay, also known as the Long Tailed Spotted Cat, is similar in appearance to the ocelot —- its body however, is smaller, growing up to 27 inches.  In comparison with the ocelot, the margay displays longer legs and tail. This cat is often confused with its relatives –- the ocelot and the oncilla. Their coats are very similar. The margay's fur is thick and its tail is really long. The tail is used as weight to help with balance. The margay is a spotted, golden brown cat with white on the belly, chest, throat, and chin. The spots may be solid black or have pale centers. The ears have white eye spots on the backs and the tail is either ringed or spotted. Margays weigh between 9-20 pounds and are between 34-52 inches long. The margay also has extremely big eyes, which helps its night time vision. Also the Margay is one of two species of cat that have flexible enough ankle joints to be able to climb down trees headfirst like a squirrel!

==What do margays eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Margays are agile hunters, leaping after and chasing birds and monkeys through the treetops.  The ankles on their back legs are so flexible that they can run down a tree head first like a squirrel. Since Margays are such great tree climbers, they often eat other mammals that live in trees such as big eared climbing rats, squirrels, opossums, small monkeys, and sloths. They also eat tree frogs, lizards and birds. They also will sometimes eat insects, grasses and sometimes even fruit.

==Fun facts==
See how much you know about margays:
*Margays have the ankle flexibility needed to climb down trees head first.
*Margays can hang from a branch by one back foot.
*Captive margays have lived for 20 years.
*Margay kittens weigh about 450 grams at birth (In comparison, a domestic kitten may weigh 110 grams).
*Margays scientific name is Leopardus Wiedii

[[Image:Jaguarundi-s.jpg|thumb|A jaguarundi]]
'''Jaguarundis''' are one of the oddest members of the cat family, rarely seen, and often thought to be otters when they were spotted.  Their scientific name, ''Herpailurus'', means &quot;snake-like cat&quot;.

==Where do jaguarundis live?==
Jaguarundis live in Central and South America, and in the southern tip of Texas.  They live in areas of lowland brush close to a running water source and will occasionally inhabit dense tropical areas.

==What do jaguarundis look like?==
This medium-sized cat has an average length of 65 cm (30 inches) with 45 cm (20 in) of tail. It has short legs and an appearance somewhat like an otter; the ears are short and rounded. The fur is a uniform chestnut brown, but can range from grey to dark brown. Their coats have no markings except for spots at birth.

==What do jaguarundis eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Jaguarundis eat fish, small mammals, reptiles and birds.  They feel comfortable in trees but prefer to hunt on the ground.

==Fun facts==
See how much you know about the jaguarundi:
*They have a name like the jaguar, but are the closest living relative of the puma.
*The Jaguarundi can reach speeds of over 60 mph

[[Image:Manul1.jpg|thumb|Manul or Pallas' Cat]]
'''Manuls''' or '''Pallas' Cats''' are the oldest living species of cat, traceable in the fossil record to 10 million years ago.  They were once thought to be the ancestor of the domestic cat Persian breed because of their highly unusual face.

==Where do manuls live?==
Manuls live on the rocky plateaus and riverbanks of Central Asia.

==What do manuls look like?==
The manul is similar to the lynx in facial structure, with a large, sturdy body and short legs. Its head is short and broad, with large round eyes and blunt wide-set ears. Its long, silky coat varies in color from light gray to russet brown, with white tips to its hairs giving a sparkling, almost iridescent appearance. There are dark lines on its cheeks, rings on its tail, and its lips, chin, and throat are white. Pallas cats are the only living species of small cat whose eyes have round pupils.


==What do manuls eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Manuls hunt by night, from the ground, and seek small mammals and birds.  The vast majority of their diet is a small animal called a ''pika'' (pronounced PY-kah) that is closely related to rabbits but has small, round ears.  Where pikas are plentiful, a manul will eat almost nothing else.

==Fun facts==
See how much you know about the manul:
*The name Pallas' Cat came from the first scientist to describe one, Peter Pallas.

[[Image:Wildkatze 002.jpg|thumb|The European Wild Cat looks much like a domestic cat]]
'''Wild cats''', which still roam the wilds, are the ancestors of the domestic cats that live in our homes.  There are three different types: the European, African (or Desert), and Asiatic Wild Cat (sometimes called Asian Steppe Wild Cat or Indian Desert Cat).

==Where do wildcats live?==
The European Wild Cat lives in forests of Western, Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in Scotland and Turkey; it is not found in Scandinavia, Iceland, England, Wales, or Ireland.  The African Wild Cat is found in deserts and savannas of Africa and the Arabian peninsula.  The Asiatic Wild Cat primarily inhabits the scrub desert of Central Asia. It is commonly believed that African wild cats were domesticated by the Egyptians and are the original domestic cats. These mated with European wild cats as they were traded by their owners to the rest of the world.

==What do wild cats look like?==
The European Wild Cat is much bigger than the Asian or African wild cats or domestic cats. The thick fur and the size are a distinguishing mark, so that a Wild Cat normally should not be mistaken for a domestic cat.  The African Wild Cat has shorter fur.  The Asiatic Wild Cat has distinct small black or red-brown spots.

==What do wild cats eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Their diet consists mainly of rodents, rabbits, hares and other small mammals, but it is likely that small birds are also eaten when the opportunity comes along.

==Fun facts==
See how much you know about the wild cat:
*There is evidence of the domestication of the African wild cat as early as 7500 BC.  Domestication of the cat may have begun as early as 8000 BC.
*The Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats as gods.  Cats seem to have never forgotten this.

'''Rusty spotted cats''' are the smallest members of the cat family.

==Where do rusty spotted cats live?==
[[Image:Rustyspottedmap.jpg|thumb|left|The range of the rusty-spotted cat appears in green]]
Rusty spotted cats live in southern India and Sri Lanka.  Those living in India mostly live in tropical dry forests and dry grasslands, but in Sri Lanka rainforests are the preferred habitat.  This may be due to competition with the Leopard Cat, which occupies the rainforests of the mainland, but does not live in Sri Lanka.

==What do rusty spotted cats look like?==
They are the smallest cats, with small, round ears, a body about 40 cm in length, plus a relatively short 20 cm tail. The color of the fur is gray, with rusty spots all over the back and the flanks. It is rather similar to its close relative the Leopard Cat.  They weigh from three to four pounds.

==What do rusty spotted cats eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Rusty spotted cats hunt at night, looking for rodents, birds and lizards.  They are known to make a meal of domestic poultry when the opportunity arises.They are popular as pets to control mice and rats

[[Image:Sand cat.JPG|thumb|A sand cat]]
'''Sand cats''' are the other extreme cat, taking the desert heat the way the snow leopard takes the icy cold. 

==Where do sand cats live?==
As its name implies, the sand cat is commonly found in sandy desert areas in the arid countries of Northern Africa, Arabia, and parts of Central Asia and Pakistan.

==What do sand cats look like?==
The sand cat’s body is well adapted to desert life - its thick, medium length fur insulates it against the extreme cold of the desert nights and its feet and pads are covered with long hair which protects them from the heat of the desert surface and gives it extra support needed in moving across the soft, shifting sands.  The large triangular ears are very sensitive to sound.

==What do sand cats eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
The sand cat hunts at night, spending the hottest part of the day sleeping under rough scrubby vegetation or a shallow burrow dug into the sand. At sunset the cat will become active, moving away from its den in search of prey.  Its diet is known to include small rodents such as gerbil and jerboas, insects, reptiles, including venomous desert snakes and birds.  They occasionally catch larger prey. They also have really great eye sight.

==Fun facts==
See how much you know about the sand cat:
*Sand cats have a low-pitched meow, but can also bark to communicate at long distances.
*Most sand cats never drink water.  They get all their moisture from their prey.
*This cat also tends to chase its tail when it gets bored or nervous.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called MikeT. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name MikeT~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Dont mean to hurt or offend anybody, but I was really shocked with the info that existed on &quot;What is a Computer Virus?&quot; on this page. I have learnt over the years from the internet 
by hunting over 1000 different websites. And I think all you wiki people are doing a great job
by bringing all this great info under one roof. And I desperately want to payback to the Internet! --[[User:60.254.123.128|60.254.123.128]] 14:46, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

Sorry forgot to log in and posted that comment. 60.254.123.128 would be me :-) --[[User:RohitUpadhyay|RohitUpadhyay]] 14:48, 23 April 2006 (UTC)


&quot;Compile it and when you get the .exe, scan it a zillion times with any of the Anti-Virus program you have got, be it, Norton, Macafee or any other, they just wont report it as a VIRUS, you know why? Because, its simply not a virus.&quot; - This makes it seem like if you wrote an actual virus and compiled it that it would be detected as one, when in fact it is highly unlikely to be dectected. --[[User:Greg|Greg]]

:Since this is supposed to talk more about how to avoid getting viruses and removing them if you have them, I'll probably edit that out at some point.  Until then, it's in limbo!  =D  As for writing one's own virus...  From what I know of viruses, most of them are variants or clones of existing viruses or exploit known security vulnerabilities.  Thus, a new virus using old virus code may be picked up by a virus scan.  Alternatively, exploiting a known security vulnerability may be picked up by live virus protection.  I.e. scanning the file may not trigger a virus warning, but programs like Norton Internet Security with live protection will monitor running programs and scripts and warn the user if a malicious scrip is being executed.  --[[User:Banzaimonkey|banzaimonkey]] 08:51, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</text>
