'''Continuous''' data is something that most people are familiar with. A quick analogy: when an analog data sensor (e.g., your eye) becomes active (you blink it open), it starts receiving input immediately (you see sun-shine), it converts the input (optical rays) to a desired output (optic nerve signals), and sends the data off to its destination (your brain). It does this without hesitation, and continues doing so until the sensor turns off (you blink your eyes closed). The output is often called a data &quot;stream&quot;; once started, it might run forever, unless something tells it to stop. Now, instead of a physical sensor, if we're able to define our data mathematically in terms of a continuous function, we can calculate our data value at ''any'' point along the data stream. It's important to realize that this provides the possibility of an infinite (∞) number of data points, no matter how small the interval might be between the start and stop limits of the data stream.

This brings us to the related concept of '''Discrete''' data. Discrete data is non-continuous, only existing at certain points along an input interval, and thereby giving us a finite number of data points to deal with. This data can also be defined by a mathematical function, but one that is limited and can only be evaluated at the discrete points of input. These are called &quot;discrete functions&quot; to distinguish them from the continuous variety.

Discrete functions and data give us the advantage of being able to deal with a finite number of data points.

== Sets and Series ==

Discrete data is displayed in sets such as:

 X[n] = [1 2 3&amp; 4 5 6]

We will be using the &quot;&amp;&quot; symbol to denote the data item that occurs at point zero. Now, by filling in values for n, we can select different values from our series:

 X[0] = 3
 X[-2] = 1
 X[3] = 6

We can move the zero point anywhere in the set that we want. It is also important to note that we can pad a series with zeros on either side, so long as we keep track of the zero-point:

 X[n] = [0 0 0 0 1 2 3&amp; 4 5 6] = [1 2 3&amp; 4 5 6]

In fact, we assume that any point in our series without an explicit value is equal to zero. So if we have the same set:

 X[n] = [1 2 3&amp; 4 5 6]

We know that every value outside of our given range is zero:

 X[100] = 0
 X[-100] = 0

== Two Types of Discrete Data Sets ==

Data can be discrete in magnitude, discrete in time, or both. Here are some examples:

;Discrete in Time: Discrete-in-time values only exist at specific points in time. If we try to take the value of a discrete-in-time data set at a time point where there is no data, our result will be zero. The image below shows an example waveform that is discrete in time, having gain values defined only at certain points along the time line. Notice that while it is discrete in time values, the gain value of each sample is not limited or quantized, and it may take any magnitude value.

[[Image:Sampled Waveform.svg|center|400px]]

;Discrete in Value: Discrete-in-value series can only exist at certain values of magnitude, no matter when we look at them. For instance, we might say that a certain computer device can only handle integers, and no decimals. The image below shows a signal that is discrete in magnitude, but is not discrete in time. While the waveform indeed has a gain value at every point in time, the values are quantized to specific magnitudes, such as only integers. The steps between the allowed values produce the &quot;staircase&quot; effect in the image. If we try to take the value at a time point exactly when the magnitude transition occurs, a quantization rule must be in place to deal with it, setting the value to the appropriate previous or subsequent magnitude.

[[Image:Quantized Waveform.svg|center|400px]]

== Stem Plots ==

[[Image:Sample Stem Plot.svg|right|thumb]]

Discrete data is frequently represented with a stem plot. Stem plots mark data points with dots, and draw a vertical line between the t-axis (the horizontal time axis) and the dot:

 F[n] = [5&amp; 4 3 2 1]

{{-}}

== About the Notation ==

The notation we use to denote the zero point of a discrete set was chosen arbitrarily. Textbooks on the subject will frequently use arrows, periods, or underscores to denote the zero position of a set. Here are some examples:

             |
             v
 Y[n] = [1 2 3 4 5]

             .
 Y[n] = [1 2 3 4 5]

             _
 Y[n] = [1 2 3 4 5]

All of these things are too tricky to write in wikibooks, so we have decided to use an ampersand (&amp;) to denote the zeropoint. The ampersand is not used for any other purpose in this book, so hopefully we can avoid some confusion.

== Sampling ==

'''Sampling''' is the process of converting continuous data into discrete data. The sampling process takes a snapshot of the value of a given input signal, rounds if necessary (for discrete-in-value systems), and outputs the discrete data. A common example of a sampler is an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).

Let's say we have a function based on time (t). We will call this continuous-time function f(t):

:&lt;math&gt;f(t) = 2tu(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Where u(t) is the unit step function. Now, if we want to sample this function, mathematically, we can plug in discrete values for t, and read the output. We will denote our sampled output as F[n]:

 F[n] = 0 : n ≤ 0
 F[1] = f(1) = 2
 F[2] = f(2) = 4
 F[100] = f(100) = 200

This means that our output series for F[n] is the following:

 F[n] = [0&amp; 2 4 6 8 10 12 ...]

== Reconstruction ==

We digitize (sample) our signal, we do some magical digital signal processing on that signal, and then what do we do with the results? Frequently, we want to convert that digital result back into an analog signal. The problem is that the sampling process loses a lot of data. Specifically, all the data between the discrete data points is lost, and if the sampler rounds the value, then a small amount of error is built into the system that can never be recovered. A common example of a reconstructor is a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC).

=== Interpolation ===

When converting a digital signal into an analog signal, frequently a process called '''Interpolation''' is used to make the analog version a more likely representation of the signal. Interpolation essentially &quot;connects the dots&quot; between discrete data points, and the reconstructor then outputs an analog waveform with the dots connected. We will show the process below:

We start out with an uninterpolated stem plot:

[[Image:Stem Plot Uninterpolated.svg|center|400px]]

We connect the points in our stem plot with straight lines (dotted lines):

[[Image:Stem Plot Linear Connectors.svg|center|400px]]

We draw new points on that line, mid way between our existing lines (dashed lines):

This is the steps I took to get Psychtoolbox to compile on my machine. I am sure this is probably not the best way (being that I was just winging it) but it might help you get going. Most are just a series of hacks and work arounds trying to get it all to compile without really knowing what I was doing. If anyone wants to improve these steps, feel free. --[[User:RobKohr|RobKohr]] 22:23, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

== Dump request ==
We want to move the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro|Blender Noob to Pro]] book to a [http://mediawiki.blender.org Blender dedicated wiki], as per request of [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]], the person who originally created the book.
I have looked into the possibilities of doing this with respect to the GFDL, and I understand that makes it necessairy to export with history. I see the importance of making the contributors aware of the fact that we are moving (or at least mirroring) the book in time. I already made a template to put on top of the pages that are to be moved: [[Template:Blenderwiki]].

Now comes the question: I looked at the [http://download.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/ latest db dump], which is from october 29. We prefer the latest dump before 'lockup' (putting up a sign). Is it possible to get a dump that has a special select query, so that we can just get everything below [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]]? (or maybe even everything below [[Blender 3D]])?

Another question is regarding the images, I don't see an easy way yet to transfer these aswell (apart from getting the [http://download.wikimedia.org/images/wikibooks/en/ upload dump], which contains a lot of files of course).

Thanks in advance!

--[[User:1983|1983]] 15:48, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:Does it really make sense to do this?  Obviously you can, but it seems to me like it might be easier just to link here.  If you make a copy, then we'll end up with some people editing here, some editing there.  The result is two versions of the book, each missing some of the information of the other.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:48, 27 October 2005 (UTC)

:: I was actually talking about a move, I said that mirroring was an option, but we prefer not to do it and just move the thing.--[[User:1983|1983]] 18:39, 27 October 2005 (UTC) 

: Is there somewhere to read more about this (like other page, or external forum/ML thread, irc logs..)? I only found the big notice which pointed me here.. but no mention of any reason as to why this would be done. --[[User:Allefant|Allefant]] 22:20, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

:: Unfortunately we do not have any IRC-logs on this, but I will ask [[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] to state this here himself. Apart from that, the main important reason is to centralise all the blender documentation. First there was just the English manual that was on the official site, but now we have french, german, spanish, italian translations being done in the same place! Before, all these things happened at different places (the german translation came from de.wikibooks!). Now these are 'official' manuals, but there's a tutorial section in the works aswell: it is becoming a huge Blender information centre. The Noob to Pro wikibook would fit perfectly in there and is most likely to be found and contributed to much quicker by all the users. It 'deserves' it, in my opionin. I hope you understand our reasons &amp; that you agree! --[[User:1983|1983]] 09:14, 2 November 2005 (UTC) 

::: Another thing; unlike wikibooks, the blenderwiki has the possibility of uploading blends, something that has been asked for a lot of times here on wikibooks, but apparently is not gonna be possible anytime soon... --[[User:1983|1983]] 17:27, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

::: Ah, yes, thanks. Makes all sense. If a link to wikibooks is out of the question, the best thing to do would indeed be to delete the book here then, and just have something like &quot;This book has moved to ...&quot;. Also, right now, the sign to not edit is up now for some days already - I would suggest to remove the sentence &quot;do not edit&quot;, and only add it back 1 or 2 days before the actual move is done. (I remember, about half a year ago when outdated statistics were displayed on the front page, it took wikibooks admins several months to react to requests to remove them.. so I wouldn't count on that export thing being available again soon.) --[[User:Allefant|Allefant]] 19:54, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

:: Hi :) I indeed would be interested in moving the Noob to Pro book and possibly other Blender books over to the blender mediawiki, for all the reasons mentioned here.  Does the Wikimedia Foundation have a policy on handling requests like this?  I understand that the foundation is interested in always bringing more and more good content and of course bringing more visitors to wikibooks.org ... I can understand that moving a book FROM wikibooks.org does not help in this regard.  I can understand that the purpose of wikibooks.org is to develop an impressive library of quality books; I understand that the last thing the Wikimedia Foundation would like to develop is a reputation as a place for budding book projects until they find a more permanent home.  However, we do feel the need to have a bit more control over the editing processes, would like to centralize the Blender documentation, and most especially need a place where we can provide blends along with the tutorials.  Moving to our own wiki would make sense for us for all these reasons.  I can see pros and cons of having two versions of the book, one here and one there... one major con would be that, were there two Noob to Pro projects, the major authors would abandon the wikibooks.org one and focus on developing the one at the new wiki site.  The Blender documentation here might become stagnated and ignored completely.  An alternative that would make sense to me would be to find a way to get the content of the Blender books here to mirror the content in the new wiki.  This way, you still have the books in your library, you are still getting that traffic and interest, and the documentation is still constantly being updated and improved.  I would like to hear other possible solutions.  I am familiar with the [[Special:Export]] page, however, with it being disabled at the moment, what other possibilities are there for exporting content, history, and images?  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:42, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

: Own BlenderWiki is as logical evolution as was WikiBooks from Wikipedia. There was need for expanded Wikipedia articles. Here we have the same case. Again, we need dedicated Blender wiki site with official documentation writers, blend files, scripts, LaTeX modules, ...etc. included. All this will raise quality level of [[Blender]] documentation. Here are still some quirks in this books, not only because of writers knowledge, but also because of amazing Blender programers speed. Here we can make nice Blender WikiBook portal with highlights from Official BlenderWiki. Well, I am happy and proud that all this with Blender MediaWiki actually started here. So cheers guys! As we said: [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro|from Noob to Pro]]. It's time for [http://mediawiki.blender.org Pro]! :) --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 20:58, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;Just go to [[Special:Export]] and enter the page names you want.&lt;/s&gt; Never mind, that's disabled at the moment. Keep checking back there though, I assume the disabling is short-term like when our search is replaced with Google's. As for images, I'm fairly certain this can do that too. Since I doubt the images have any history you can just dump them right away. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:56, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

I understand the desire to have all the blender related material in one place. And I'm not saying that I'm against it. But just remember, it's not always good to have all your resources in one place. What if something happens to the blender wiki? People could still come here. But not if it's been moved. I'm not taking a position here, just playing devil's adovacte. --[[User:205.174.143.2|205.174.143.2]] 21:43, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

I personally strongly disagree with the idea to actually move (i.e. delete here) the wikibook. The editing process on blenderwiki has certain restrictions, which may be good for an official manual, but will slow the editing process. I think it's a better idea to leave the Wikibook where it is. --[[User:Soylentgreen|Soylentgreen]] 19:55, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

== Need to include some example C++ implementations to PADsynth article ==

Hi.
I am Paul and I wrote the [[PADsynth_synthesis_algorithm]] article. I would like to include some source code (at least a complete class) into wikibooks. 
Now, I posted a link to sourceforge ( http://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.net/doc/PADsynth/implementation/PADsynth_implementation.zip ) but I would like to be everything here: to avoid need of external source.
I have seen that I cannot upload the .zip file and I need help (at least to post PADsynth.cpp and PADsynth.h) from that .zip arhive and link to the article (book). 
I consider that is a very good thing to show that example implementation into the article/book.
Should I try to wikify the source code? (PADsynth.cpp+h)
Thanks.

== Fitness WB ==

I am currently working on a rough draft of a weight training book and I noticed that there are a very few wikibooks on fitness in general. Should I instead focus on a more general fitness WB?

== Wiki Wikibook ==
Hi, I'm fairly new to the Wikibooks community, and have constantly been having questions about how to edit wikis. a lot of my questions can be answered by the How to Edit a Wiki page, but some specific questions (mainly about how to change the way tables look) are hard to come by. I was wondering if there is a &quot;How to edit wikis&quot; wikibook, or if there are any plans to make one. Thanks. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 22:41, 31 October 2005 (UTC)

Hi DettoAltrimenti: I don't know if there is a &quot;How to edit wikis&quot; (how about &quot;How to wiki-edit&quot;?) wikibook - at least, I haven't come by one - but I'd volunteer to contribute to one as I've had thoughts along the same lines as yourself. (For starters I'd suggest reformatting the [[m:Help:Editing|Editing help]] page - which I note has a &quot;This page needs Cleanup...&quot; message...) &amp;nbsp;Anyone else? &amp;nbsp;[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 00:35, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

: Hello, the [[m:Help:Contents|MediaWiki Handbook]] might just what you are looking for. It continues to help me with tables and templates. As for an actual wikibook on the subject, the '''MediaWiki Handbook''' is on a bookshelf even though it links to another Wikimedia project. I guess one would say that that it is on permanent loan to [[m:Main Page|Meta]]. Any additional thoughts would be appreciated. --[[User:Robert Harrison|Robert Harrison]] 13:34, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

:: I'm the editor who put the &quot;clean-up&quot; notice on the [[m:Help:Editing|meta editing help]] page.  I did that right after another well-meaning editor took out all the useful &quot;quick reference&quot; stuff.  I and other editors put all that stuff back and then tried to streamline it.  The &quot;cleanup&quot; tag can probably come off.  But reformatting the information might still be useful.  I also started an FAQ over there for all the little obscure tips and tricks that were sneaking into [[m:Help:Editing|Help:Editing]] or building up in the related talk pages.  You can continue to mine the help talk pages for tips and tricks that might make good material for the mediawiki handbook.  Or you could create more links from the mediawiki handbook to the help pages.  And links from [[m:Help:Editing|Help:Editing]] to the mediawiki handbook. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 15:38, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

Thanks Robert and SV. The [[m:Help:Contents|MediaWiki Handbook]] might indeed be what I (and maybe DettoAltrimenti) have in mind. Although it's probably dealt with elsewhere, I'll ask this here: How would I download the current Handbook in (say) PDF form?  Apologies in advance if I've missed the obvious. &amp;nbsp;[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 17:45, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

: Hey David, I know that it is possible to convert wiki to pdf, and I've even found a [[m:PDF Export|page]] that might b what you're looking for, but I can't make heads or tails out of it (over my head). Besides the link provided I know that you can create a printable view of most pages using MediaWiki. Hint: Look in the toolbox on the left. That's all I know. Hope it helps. --[[User:Robert Harrison|Robert Harrison]] 00:58, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

Thanks again, Robert. I checked out the [[m:PDF Export|PDF export page]] you mention and downloaded a freeware version of the Htmldoc program mentioned (htmldoc-1.8.23-winfree.exe, available from various internet locations). The scripts in the rest of the page are to include in the freely-available source code for the program, to make it more wiki-friendly. Time plus a lack of experience has prevented me from trying to compile this version of the program, but I have been able to print a few MediaWiki Handbook pages using the basic Htmldoc v1.8.23 program. I think, however, your timely reminder re the lefthand-side toolbox is where I'll be heading - thanks! &amp;nbsp;[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 22:41, 2 November 2005 (UTC)

== Pegagogy ==

There is only a short wikipedia entry on this- the study of teaching. Would anyone be interested in writing a book about this- I am interested in both analyzing the current systems of teaching in seperate countries, and also theory behind teaching (I am writing a draft on pedagogy for my grad school application). first, would the history of pedagogy and current pedagogy be a different wikibook than pedagogy theory? And second, is anyone qualified and/or interested in this subject? please respond on my talk page if you're interested in collaborating with me on this.

== Wikibooks account - Separate from Wikipedia?? ==

I have an account in Wikipedia, but I have to create a separate account in Wikibooks. This doesn't make sense to me since they're the same basic site - just different projects. Does anyone know why they haven't combined both account systems? I've also noticed theres no &quot;+&quot; button on wikibooks.. why... The way I see it, Wikibooks should be EXACTLY like wikipedia - except containing books rather than articles.

:The accounts is a shortcoming of the MediaWiki software-  every MediaWiki project has its own set of user accounts.  I think they're working on it, but there are several technical (db load) and non-technical (what do you do if 2 different people have the same name, one on each site?).  

:I'm not sure what you mean by a plus button.  Never seen one on Wikipedia, but I don't contribute there much.  Likely one of the two is on a slightly newer version of MediaWiki, or has an extension the other doesn't.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 04:04, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

::The &quot;plus&quot; button is something that depends on the skin you are using, and sometimes appears on talk pages to add a new comment section.  Since this isn't a talk page, you don't get that generated automatically either on the &quot;edit this page&quot;.  As far as having to create seperate accounts, this isn't just for Wikibooks but for all other Wikimedia projects as well.  Just as you have said, there is an effort to try and get the accounts coordinated with a universal login, but that may prove to be harder than it seems on the fact of it.  The huge issue is mainly to create a seperate db for just user login entries and making changes to MediaWiki to take advantage of the change.  Also, the existing projects are heavily integrated with the current setup and MySQL in particular (the underlying db running the servers for Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects) doesn't take too kindly with accessing a secondary db for some queries.  Not impossible, but it does make life harder.  Also, each of these projects like Wikibooks has its own enforcement policies, and deciding to block an individual user on one project doesn't mean at the moment that you are blocked everywhere.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:02, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

== Wikibooks as a bulletin board for exchanging game passwords ==
An article that was an attempt to create a wiki bulletin board for exchanging passwords for [[Golden Sun]] between players of the the game was deleted from Wikipedia.  See [[w:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Golden Sun Password]].  A Wikipedia editor is now claiming that it should be transwikied to Wikibooks, because it belongs in the game guide.  I am arguing, by reference to our official [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] policy, that Wikibooks is no more a free wiki host or a resource for conducting business (i.e. for storing files and data generated by players as they actually play the game) than Wikipedia is, and that the wikibook on the game has no need for this content, which is not instructional in any way.

:As far as I know there is no bar to linking to other sites.  Of course you should use common sense and not link to sites that encourage anything criminal.  The mere fact that another site is commercial is not a problem. As for information on how to patch a program in some jurisdictions that might fall foul of a ban on reverse engineering.

::Generally talking about the existance of patches, and about using a program to install one doesn't create an issue in all but the most restrictive countries, but talking about how to manually change the dll then use those changes to make a patch could be an issue.

== 'Austrian' does not exist ==

I'd like to draw attention to the article about so-called Austrian language and would like to clear up information that simply is false.

When you read articles and books by linguists discussing the heterogeneous language German, you will find out that they don't talk about 'Austrian', but rather 'Austrian-German' (or the Austrian variation of German, which differs from German spoken in Germany or Switzerland) a bit in pronounciation and specific vocabulary). It is NOT a dialect, but rather German, spoken by Austrians with their specific Austrian accent (as in different parts of Germany and Switzerland people also speak with their specific regional accent). In school Austrians are not taught a dialect but German.

Next to the so-called Standard-German people speak dialects as well (as they also do in Germany and Switzerland). This is colloquial language and it is rather widespread, BUT it is not Austrian. Besides, there is not one Austrian dialect but many that differ from each other.

:It would have been nice if you had included a link to this section of whichever book its from so the context and language of it could be looked at easily...then again personally I would have put this in the talk section of the relevent page.  That said, I don't think it is intended any diffrently from the way some Americans like to call American-English American, or think of it a seperate language instead of a dialect, though personally I'm not sure where the demarcation line between dialect and derived language 'officially' is for modern languages.

Take a look at mess made by &quot;[[User:Psychonaut|Psychonaut]]&quot;. It took a long time to revert his page moving, they may be next attacks.

I think that we aren't properly prepared to fight vandalism. How many admins watch recent changes? Only a few. IRC channel for talk and with anti-vandal bot are empty. Every sysop should watch [[WB:VIP]] - are do sysops remeber about it?

I think we need some more admins devoted to fighting vandalism (in fact, reverting and deleting pages are main duties of the sysop function!). Admins should be easy to contact - they should watch VIP and be available at IRC. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 15:27, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

Just not really necessary because of the lesser volume? --[[User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] [[User talk:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;(Dark Mark)&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:45, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

Well, less people think Wikibooks are cool than do think it about Wikipedia [[Image:wink.png]] We have less users, less edits and - logically - less admins. I haven't seen rejected request for adminship, so I would say that we take anyone who's eager, ha ha. If they were more RFA's, they will be more sysops (and we wouldn't have to take everyone who's able to write in Wikicode). Ok, just kidding ;-) --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 19:57, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:Instead of criticizing the response of the sysops, or even the dwindling number of active sysops, we instead should worry about how easy it for a vandal to move pages, and alter the page structure here. Moving pages can be very destructive, there is even a warning to the effect on the moving pages page. I suggest then, that perhaps moving pages should be restricted to admins only, because page moving really can affect the shape and structure of books. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:03, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

::I object. This is a wiki and should be open to any registered editor. We can trust most people with the page move button, because we can always move it back. Admin tools are a totally different matter. Some tools (image deletion, etc.) cannot be undone. We can trust good faith editors to move pages responsibly, but some may not be ready to handle adminship. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&amp;quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:12, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

::It's not possible - such kind of restriction would require change in software settings - and Wikimedia Foundation will not agree to it. Apart from it, this is very bad idea. We have lots of cases of pages that do not follow naming policy. You have to move them and administators can't do everything. I think the solution is to make more sysops (of cource, we should use normal procedures and do not lower requirements for future admins) and watching recent changes - with help of bots. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 20:13, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:::::That is a good question. For a long time, i've wondered if they even maintain a count of edits per user.

::::::The big problem with trying to get just a count of the number of edits per user is that it takes CPU bandwidth on the MySQL servers running the whole thing.  The developers are lothsome to allow anything that increases CPU bandwidth at the moment for any purpose, even if the consequence is you writing a spidering bot that does the same thing and sucks up even more bandwidth as a result.  I know, it doesn't make much sense to me either, but that is the current attitude right now on the developer side.  There are many &quot;features&quot; that have been turned off as a result, even if they would be useful for admins or for article preparation.  New ideas for presentation of content does get quite a bit of attention, especially if you can simplify the user interface and even better if you can cut down on the server storage of information.  Those ideas seem to make it onto Wikimedia projects.&lt;p&gt;The only way I know at the moment to count edits is to simply look at the contribution list.  Sometimes switch to the 500 edits view and then count how many pages (roughly) that I need to see the whole history of an editor.  Talk about sucking server bandwidth as well, but it does work as a general rule of thumb.  Vandals usually have less than 50 edits, even when they are done with their damage.&lt;p&gt;As far as dealing with vandals, I've had some sinister thoughts about the subject, like even going back to the vandal directly and... well... perhaps doing something back.  At the very least try to get their ISP account dropped or do some harder fighting.  I've had some ''limited'' success doing this with e-mail spam, but the best success I've had is with things like http://spamcop.net  It would be nice to get something similar as an inter-wiki policing group that would monitor the ISPs that seem to have problems with vandals or to keep track of potentially who is doing the vandalism.&lt;p&gt;The problem with raising the bar through technical challenges like this is that the vandals eventually do overcome the obsticles and still get through, making a technical arms race and giving the vandals a challenge.  The other approach, and usually followed by most Wikis as well, is to give a mile to the vandals, let them have their fun in the sun until they get bored as vandalism on a Wiki is hardly any challenge, and then they move on.  At that point you can clean up after them.  The way to really make things suck for a vandal is to automate cleanup to the point that cleaning up after vandals is a trivial exercise.  Automation like a single click to &quot;revert all changes by user:vandalx1&quot; would IMHO be the ultimate weapon against vandals.  A sysop could then simply revert everything they have done almost immediately with no effort.  Only when somebody has subsequently gone in and added content to a vandalized page would there be a conflict, and those tend to be the most difficult types of reversions for me anyway.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:35, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

Thanks, Rob, for your thoughts. Re the very last, I suppose the single-click &quot;revert all changes by X&quot; could at the same time send a standard warning/apology message to any other users who'd contributed to a page without spotting X's vandalism, inviting them to review the page and restore any of their work lost. (Or would this make too much demand on the software?) &amp;nbsp;Meanwhile, in response to the cry for more admin, I volunteer myself - although (a) I don't know if I qualify; and (b) I could make no promise as to how regularly I could patrol.&lt;br&gt;
Best wishes, [[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 03:27, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

:Don't be surprised if you end up patrolling more than you expect. I mainly wanted to be an admin so I could speedy-delete edited redirects. Without admin rights, a reorganization that requires page moves can turn into a complicated mess that must be carefully planned to avoid getting stuck... if it's even possible. I guess I was also pretty upset about how {{user|Gumba_gumba}} got away  with posting a sick poem everywhere for 93 minutes. I wasn't planning to do anything else, but somehow I ended up patrolling the recent changes (often) and the list of requested speedy deletes (occasionally).

==Speedy Deletion Warning==

In the next 24 to 48 hours, I will delete a variety of pages from Wikibooks which are a clear and simple violation of our charter. [[Jokebook]], [[Getting a date]], [[Naturism]] are all not textbooks and need to be moved to another site.  There may be more.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 17:27, 13 November 2005 (UTC) 

:Shouldn't we give authors of these books a bit more time to move them? Because normal user cannot view deleted book, book authors will be asking administrators to get source of these books again and again. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:22, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

I'm happy to give more time, but these books are already candidates for speedy deletion.  The point is that, to give on example which was thankfully already deleted, a racist white-power book is not a textbook, never will be a textbook, and should have been deleted on site and the creator banned for vandalism on site.  --[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 21:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

::I was shocked to find a racist white-power book in Wikibooks, but looking through the definition of what makes a Wikibook, the concept seemed to match our mission of conveying information that some people would find pertinent in the most concise manner possible.  Along with the information of what definitions and resources existed, there was some persuasive writing, but no more than other Wikibooks.  For me, the only objection to the book was content.  I'm sure that many of us would feel uncomfortable being associated with a resource for neo-Nazis.  Yet, we have to be honest about our objections.  We object to the content, not the format.  I strongly suspect that '''''no''''' book on racist white-power will ever be acceptable to Wikibooks regardless of how tightly it conforms to our definition of a ''textbook''.  --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 15:16, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

:::I don't see how that's reasonable at all.  A neutral textbook on the white-power movement and its history would be perfectly acceptable&amp;mdash;indeed, there are plenty of proprietary textbooks on the subject already available, and there exist many university courses specifically on that subject, since it is an important cultural and historical issue.  Now a non-neutral textbook explicitly ''promoting'' white power would be another matter. --[[User:65.182.51.67|65.182.51.67]] 02:16, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

::::Who was responsible for making this decision? Was there ever a discussion or a vote, or did Jimbo Wales just decide to order this today? [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 20:51, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

It isn't an order.  It's 100% consistent with policy.  These sorts of things are clearly listed as exceptions on what wikibooks is not, and therefore are speedy deletion candidates  already.  I do think policy needs to be clarified, because Wikibooks is having a problem with excessive off-mission stuff.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 21:01, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

::::All I can find that applies to any of these on [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] is the sentence, &quot;Wikibooks is not a place for users to publish content unrelated to our main objective.&quot; I agree that much of this needs to go, but we need to have a clear policy on what is acceptable and what is not. &quot;'''Wikibooks''' is a collection of [[w:open content|open content]] [[w:textbooks|textbooks]], manuals, and other texts, with supporting book-based texts that are being collaboratively written.&quot; ([[Wikibooks:About]]) Where do we draw the line? What topics may we have manuals on? What &quot;other texts&quot; are okay? We need to either form extremely clear criteria for speedy deleting these or discuss each of these books individually on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. [[User:Guanaco|Guanaco]] 21:41, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

&quot;Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider&quot; and &quot;Wikibooks is not a place to publish original works&quot; and &quot;Wikibooks is not a soapbox&quot; are all violated.  I do agree that the criteria could be made clearer, but these three books aren't difficult cases.  Niether was the white power book which someone already deleted.  If there are borderline cases, these can be discussed, and policy can be clarified, but we don't need to wait for clarification of difficult cases to say, ok, let's deal with the easy ones promptly.

One very simple thing we can do is ask ourselves: is this a textbook?  If it is, if we can easily point to a course which uses this sort of textbook, then fine.  If not, then some kind of extraordinary rationale has to be there in order to keep it.  Take a look at the VfD debates -- many people seem to be confused about the purpose of the site.  I think getting rid of this stuff is a major positive step in the right direction.  --[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 23:44, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

:We have to change our guidelines for new pages. To see what is valid, check [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#What Wikibooks includes]] - this is Jimbo's opinion on our mission.

'''This is an important discussion.''' This could affect almost all of Wikibooks. So under this new enforcement of policy, what are we to do with [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf]], for example. They are not really textbooks. This needs to have more attention. Can we have this discussion on it's own page, and have some sort of notice at the top of every page, sort of like when we are doing fundraising, etc.? This affects all of Wikibooks and more attention needs to be paid to this. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:55, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

'''Important Comment''' - I would strongly suggest that Jimbo try to trust the Wikibooks community a little bit.  We did delete the White Power Wikibook, and most other patent nonsense does need to go as well.  We do tend to be a little more lax on some things, and perhaps some of these non-books need to go as well.  Several other Wikibooks have been deleted recently, so it is important to note that we have been doing some policing of content here as it is.  I also want to thank Jimbo for coming into Wikibooks, and if he wants to &quot;clean house&quot; he is certainly welcome.  My own philosophy is to encourage new Wikibooks and give them plenty of time to prove themselves.  Most of the time books like the White Power Wikibook cut their own throat through multiple policy violations, which in that case was most obvious a copyright violation that had nothing to do with content at all otherwise.  It was also a Wikipedia entry that was also out of place.  If we can find a good reason to remove content that avoids dealing with the controvercial issues that the book module may raise, it makes it much easier to remove it in the first place.  I'm sorry if you feel I'm being too lax in my administrator duties and letting people like the books you've mentioned slide by.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:14, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

'''Developing A Universal Religion''' This book was written to be used as a textbook (that is, all of the parts together were written with this in mind, see the Introduction section, or see below).

:'''More Commentary''' - This does seem like an arbitrary decision here on some of this content.  One of the problems here is that books like [[Jokebook]] have been allowed to persist on Wikibooks for some time.  Going through the history of this Wikibook you can see that the first edit was November 2004.  That means it has been on here for some time and until now never challenged.  There were also early edits by people who were admins here, so obviously there is some question as to if it really belongs.  Generally, Wikibooks that predated my active involvement here I've left alone unless it was an obvious policy violation, particularly if it was an individual soapbox, of which this wasn't.
:There were several problems with Wikibooks, of which a few have been resolved somewhat recently.  One of the largest of them was the fact that bureaucrats running this project &quot;fell asleep&quot; and didn't approve any new admins for a considerable length of time.  Thanks to Aya, that logjam has been broken, but now we are facing a situation where there are a bunch of brand new admins who are still trying to get used to Wikimedia policies in general, and as a matter of fact trying to even establish consistant policies here on Wikibooks where essentially none have existed until recently.  There were some general ones, but they were very confusing.  The current set of policies for this project are a huge improvement over what was here earlier and a bunch of work has gone into trying to write those policies.  I don't see the huge need for new admins compared to what was the problem earlier, although I will be the first to admit that we could use a little more help in general.  At this point, IMHO, we need to develop some more users who are contributing to Wikibooks in general and help them get the skills needed to become admins.  Or more importantly, we need to recruit more general participation in Wikibooks so we have a user base to draw upon to get more admins.
:At the same time, a general housecleaning has been needed as well.  The problem that we have been facing as admins is that projects like [[Jokebook]] and others have such a huge established development community that no single admin has been willing to take the arrows needed to remove such content.  The best tool we have, the VfD discussions, would be quickly overwhelmed and have so many votes to keep that it would be hard to remove content like this, even if it doesn't belong.  Brand-new Wikibooks don't have this problem as it is usually just one author trying to get started and the rest of the active community who participates in VfD discussions generally form more rational arguments for or against this new Wikibook.  There are still some issues like the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] where a large community comes from another project, especially Wikipedia in this case, and not only are well versed with Wikimedia policies and the use of MediaWiki software, but have a unified voice even though they are not necessarily sock puppets in the traditional sense of the term.  BTW, nothing against the Muggles' Guide in particular, but other projects can come over like that and have in the past.  The problem is most pronounced with a VfD discussion happens on Wikipedia and the supporters of an article try to refocus and do things here on Wikibooks when they are told to go away from Wikipedia, often with the support of Wikipedia admins.
:Things like [[Colonising Mars]] are another example of an outside group that tries to write a Wikibook as a group where an individual admin can feel brow-beaten to aquiesce and allow a Wikibook to develop even if it shouldn't be here.  In this case I've stuck to my guns and tried instead to mentor the contributors to keep it from becoming a political soapbox, which I think may be a better solution anyway.  This isn't as big of a problem because the contributors are still new to Wikibooks and Wikimedia projects.  On the other hand, we should be encouraging groups like this to author legitimate textbook material.
:I guess what we really need to have here is a good review of the &quot;project charter&quot; for Wikibooks as opposed to the goals and aims of Wikimedia projects in general.  What should the future of Wikibooks be?  Should it be confined strictly to textbook materials that could be found in a formal educational setting?  Should we even go so far as to require that a Wikibook meet specific curriculum objectives and be academically focused?  Would the &quot;charter&quot; of a Wikibook require specific application to a specific educational setting such as a university course or something on Wikiversity?  In this regard, that would be a huge change for Wikibooks and a significant narrowing of the scope of this project.  The other extreme is to allow any non-fiction material on here that can't be relocated onto one of the other Wikimedia projects.  This opposite extreme is more or less what has happened here on Wikibooks and apparently something Jimbo isn't happy about.  I think scholarly publications that you can cite references and in general document the source of the ideas you are presenting should be allowed to remain on Wikibooks, but even that has its limits.  What should we do as a project?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:59, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

::I was suprised when someone showed me [[Wikibooks talk:Policy/Vote#A directly enumerated WikiBooks policy]], because I saw it for the first time. In my opinion, it's fairy good attempt to clearly state what content is and what is not suitable for Wikibooks and covers most of types of books I would like to see on Wikibooks as well as books I think shouldn't be here. In needs some work (there's open discussion there) but I think with small tweaks it will be very useful. Wikibooks has tendency to make endless discussions (like about [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]) and as a result we have great mess. Maybe we should move on with this proposal. Having this compact set of rules, we can easier discuss future of Wikibooks with Jimbo. I think this discussion should move to that page. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] &amp;#91;&amp;#91;User talk:Derbeth&amp;#124;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;talk&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;]] 09:43, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

=== what it means to be a text ===

[[Getting a date]] is not based on a random idea for a book; the subject is repesented by courses in many continuing/community education programs, in courses on dating - sometimes specifically for a narrow audience (specific gender or age).  I happen to live in Boston, and am most familiar with courses available at unis there; at any given moment there are a few about dating skills, often withslightly provocative names. 

Some random googlable examples : The whole &quot;Skills with Dating&quot; course set at (Fondation Course, Intro workshop, 'for Teens and their Parents') at Strathfield CC in Oz, semanticist Steve Stockdale's &quot;lucid dating&quot; classes at SMU, ... in Boston: [http://www.bcae.org/SearchECat?Open&amp;Query=dating Boston Center for Adult Education], and the [http://www.ccae.org/catalog/courses/course_details.php?id=524452 Cambridge Center].

Not to mention all of the self-help and life-improvement courses one
can take outside of universities, complete with dozens of sessions and texts and audiotapes... I don't know if these count as 'courses', or if the assigned texts (often authored by the person leading the course; though this happens in academia as well) count as texts.

Is the opposition to [[Getting a date]] a naming issue?  A lingering issue based on the crudeness of some of the original content?  Bad content should not bar an entire class of books from the project forever.  Would people opposed to that wikibook (or set of books) feel better if it were renamed to &quot;[[Dating skills]]&quot;, or became a section of longer books with titles such as &quot;[[Developing healthy relationships]]&quot;?

Most of the dating courses I found in a quick google search just used syllabi or a set of notes... or a motivational book, with little other content.  Of course having access to a good free textbook with accumulated information might change that.

--[[User:Sj|Sj]] 12:02, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

:The opposition is mainly on the part of Jimbo coming in and trying to clean house.  Wikibooks has strayed from the &quot;original focus&quot; of being a space for collaboratively written textbooks.  This has nothing to do with any particular Wikibook, but the focus of Wikibooks as a whole.  In this case, he is using [[Getting a date]] to give an example of how Wikibooks has gone too far, and perhaps we need to retrench and think about how we can get more into traditional textbooks like [[Calculus]] and [[World History]].  More particularly, how can we recruit people to help us with these more traditional books instead of off the wall books like [[Useless Information]].  Just where do we draw the line on books like this?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:08, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

==Pages needing attention==
I think we need to pay more attention to controversial and inaccurate books. I don't think that current structure with [[Wikibooks:Pages needing attention]], [[Wikibooks:List of controversial issues]] and some similar pages helps tracking problems. Someone should re-organize these pages and provide proper links to them from Community portal and from other articles. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:52, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

I created [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks maintenance]] page to gather all maintenance tasks in one place. I hope this will help cleaning up Wikibooks. BTW, I think that [[Wikibooks:Accuracy dispute]] should be marged to [[Wikibooks:Pages needing attention]] and [[Wikibooks:List of controversial issues]] should be merged to [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]] - it's hard to watch all these pages (and they are blank now). What do you think about it? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 11:56, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

== is there an online catalog? ==

I am writing a freeware plugin for Media PCs  running Meedio (see here : http://www.meedio.com/maid/detail.php?mode=detail&amp;plugin_id={A6FD6A4A-1BCD-4D7F-ADE7-C84C6E2F43F8} ) which allows people to read and browse for books in Project Gutenberg from their media PC. I currently also link into Google print, amd am working on a new version which brings in information from Project Gutenberg's MARC records file and ties in (where possible) to the Library of Congress' web site.

I'd like to also tie in to wikibooks. the end effect would be that the user has a list of available works on his machine, browses for what they want, and, on selecting a work of interest, goes to the wikibooks site.

But, to make this happen, I need an XML document, a MARC record file, an RSS feed -- something. Anything which points to all the works currently on the wikibooks site. Spidering the site is possible, but impractical. it would be a *lot* of hits on the site, would be slow, etc.

So, does anything resembling what I would need exist?

BTW, my plugin is freeware. I'm doing this because I can and because I'm having fun. I'm not affiliated with Meedio.

:We have the [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] where we are trying to organize a cataloging effort, but I have been side tracked into other areas to really push this effort forward like it deserves.  The big problem we would face with Wikibooks is trying to actually classify each of the existing Wikibooks, and try to organize the effort to classify the new Wikibooks as well.  There are some neat ideas on the talk page of the CCO, but they need to be actually implemented.

:If you have an idea for a file format that we could use for this classification effort, that would be appreciated as well.  Establishing an XML Doctype or other similar protocol would be useful as well.  Adding RSS feeds, however, is something you need to take up with the MediaWiki developers.  I think it is a neat idea, and it would be fun to have some sort of RSS record get sent whenever we create a new Wikibook.

:Basically, you have caught us at a bad time for this idea, and we need to build the tools that you are asking for.  If you want to help do this for us, it would be very much appreciated.  This is something that we need somebody to take leadership and make it happen.  Right now most of the participants on this project are so busy simply adding content to the books that usually they don't get involved in the larger organizational issues here, and that is unfortunate in some ways.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:26, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== New CSD criteria proposal ==
I recently added a comment at [[Wikibooks talk:Deletion policy#New Speedy Criteria Proposal]] and am seeking comment.

*I'm going to bring up a slightly larger issue here.  The page [[Help:Editing#Redirecting|Wikibooks:Redirect]] has some policy/guideline issues on it, and I'm suggesting that perhaps this page needs to be rewritten to become a policy on Wikibooks.  It is both a policy page and a tutorial, and I'm suggesting that the two concepts need to be seperated.  Lord Voldemort's suggestion of dealing with double redirects could be added or adapted from this page.  If you want to tackle that issue LV, you are welcome to start the new policy page as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:46, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== VfD ==
VfD is getting rather large, and in particular, I have an issue with one of the sections. How to crack a Widows XP password has a lot of anon votes. I have a list of the IPs and how they voted if someone wants them. And how long do things need to stay in VfD??? Let's move things along over there. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:36, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

:Have some patience here.  Things just take a little bit longer on Wikibooks.  I'm going take a look right now at the discussion.  Often a VfD discussion, particularly if there is mixed opinion on the topic, will go on for a month or more.  The anon votes in particular add confusion, but I think their opinion is still relevant as long as they are giving coherant and rational justifications to the argument to keep or delete a Wikibook or module.  The other aspect is that I prefer to let a neutral admin try to resolve a VfD discussion if I have a personal stake in the argument and have advocated a clear position, in an attempt to try and be fair to the discussion as opposed to appearing arbitrary in my decision to end the discussion.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:26, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

Well obviously a neutral Admin should be the one closing the votes, but some of those sections have been sitting around for weeks upon weeks now. And I don't think anon votes should be counted. That's how we stop sockpuppets and proxies from imposing their will. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:38, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

::The opinion of anyone who makes a civil and rational argument based upon our policies should be counted, anonymous or pseudonymous.

[[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 00:37, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

I get that it is about discussion, not votes, but one of the advantages of having a user name is the privilege of voting on things. The comments should not be removed (they might influence logged in users to their position), but they cannot possibly be regarded as part of consensus. We don't want someone just stopping by for the first time to determine the content here. Trusted members of the community simply carry more weight. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:32, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

== Book v. Image Deletions ==

When a book is deleted, do the images that link to nothing but that book also get deleted?  The reason I ask has to do with [[Naturism]].  One of the images used by that book may have legal difficulties with child porn laws.  I was going to raise the issue here, but I saw that it had been nominated for speedy deletion and didn't worry about it.  But it occurs to me that the images might not get deleted with the book.  If the images do not get deleted with the book, then we need to decide whether one of its pictures has the potential to get us in trouble.  (I don't remember offhand which image is the possible problem.  I am checking while writing this, but the images are taking intollerably long to load.)  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 22:16, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

: No, when you delete page, only its content is removed. If you have a multi-chapter book you have to delete every single chapter and every single image used. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:18, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

Then the problem of the possibly illegal image is still live.  Most of the images on this book with under-age subjects are so completely non-sexual, that I would assume them to be legally innocuous.  However, one image shows what appears to be a partially erect teen-age boy sitting at a table (using a laptop computer, IIRC).  It's taking long enough for the images to load that I'll have to check back latter for the image name. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 22:35, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

::This book according to [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not a soapbox]] should be speedy deleted. ''unsigned comment by unknown user''

:We can do it even now, the question is - should we leave some time for book author for copy it's contents? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:46, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

::The image I was concerned about is [[:Image:Privatenaturism.jpg]].  I understand that the book will be speedily deleted for other reasons.  I just wanted to make sure that whoever deleted the book was aware that there was separate issue beyond the reason for book's speedy deletion concerning this image (it may count as child porn).  ''Either'' the image should go with the rest of the book ''or'' the legality issue should be taken up separately. ''unsigned comment by unknown user''

:::I'm hoping that most new media content for Wikibooks is added to commons instead.  You can then deal with the policy on that project who are much better equiped to deal with those issues indepently.  IMHO, if the one and only place that an image links to is a Wikibook that is being deleted, there is generally no reason to keep the image either.  I think it would be a good change to deletion policy to remove all media files associated with that Wikibook as well.  The one issue that may come up is the undeletion issues.  Once you have deleted an image, it is a permanent deletion, unlike deletion of text.  Admins can &quot;undelete&quot; text that has been killed earlier.  If a Wikibook was removed and then undeleted, it would be nice to get the images back that were there in the first place.

:::In this case, because of Jimbo's fiat demand that the book be deleted, there is no way it will be undeleted. The images might as well go with it. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:01, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

: AFAIK there's no strict policy. You have to be careful when deleting images, because they cannot be restored. I delete only images older than a year. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:23, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

::If it isn't a copyvio, see if there is a module that would be improved with the image in it. If so, add it. If not, you could always nominate it for deletion. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:54, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

:::Perhaps they should be trans-wikied to Wikimedia Commons instead?  We don't need them cloging up the database locally, and it allows us to deal with issues like fair-use that Commons doesn't want to work with.  That would be the only reason IMHO images should be uploaded locally anyway.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:47, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

: It's not good idea. Most of unused images don't have license (we introduced copyright tags just a month ago) and they are Wikibooks-specific (diagrams, book covers, etc.) or have very poor quality (small size miniatures, duplicates). --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:53, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

:::The key point here is '''unlinked''' images.  Not something that is directly connected to a current Wikibook.  As for copyright tags, the presumption is that the images have to be compatable with the GFDL in some manner.  I was not aware that the copyright tags were recently introduced for Wikibooks, but that shouldn't matter too much anyway, as the disclaimer to strongly recommend the images be put on Commons is several months old now.  Commons has had copyright tags almost from the beginning of that project, and is yet another point to strongly suggest that the images be kept mainly on that project, where there is a much better job of policing the images there.  Commons may be willing to give a little more lattitude to images that predate the establishment of Wikimedia Commons as a project if it came from another Wikimedia project like Wikibooks and otherwise seems to be a legitimate attempt to have free-source images.  Project specific images and charts that are specific to a deleted module don't need to be kept.  Of course I could be spouting off patent nonsense on this issue as well. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:33, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

:It is a slightly larger issue than that.  The whole issue with the computer game guides is something that does need a strong community forum to discuss.  So far I havn't seen that either although I suspect it has been debated on IRC a few times.  We do need to debate the whole issue about the role and purpose of Wikibooks, and perhaps bring it to the wider Wikimedia community as well.  So far I have resisted adding the discussion about this whole thing to Foundation-l until we have been able to form some opinions on this whole subject within our community here on Wikibooks.  We are not existing within a vacuum either, as this not only affects en.wikibooks, but this formal policy change also affect the other language Wikibooks as well, particularly coming from Jimbo as it has.  Changing the wording of the enforced policy makes a huge difference in this case, especially when one significant sentence had its meaning changed to the exact opposite of what was there before.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:24, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

::Yeah, it is a bit worrisome that at this point in the project, we are suddenly unclear about the mission of the site. Textbooks are a given, but i think it's also of significant benefit to host manuals as well. I say this especially because both textbooks and instructional manuals can both be used to teach a topic. Also, there is a significant different between manuals, that we might need to take a look at. Consider the difference between a manual on &quot;Basic Photoshop commands&quot;, as opposed to a guide on &quot;How to create interesting web graphics using photoshop.&quot; In general, i think it's in our best interests to accumulate useful, teachable information, regardless of the specific form that information takes (manuals, books, textbooks, etc...). This is not to say that wikibooks should be a catch-all, but things that don't quite fit on the 'pedia, and are &quot;good enough&quot; should probably be able to find a home here.

== Categorizing books by educational attainment, level, difficulty, target audience, etc. ==

I was browsing the Algebra book when I stumbled on a [[Talk:Algebra|discussion]] about the appropriate level of understanding required of the audience and the category that the books belonged to.  While reading the, short, discussion it occured to me that some of the terms used were meaningless to me because they referred to a particular educational system (US I think).  For textbooks of fundamental mathematics and similar topics it is very important that the exposition be appropriate to the target audience but how can we do that if we do not have any consensus regarding the description of that audience?  Here is the comment that I added to the discussion.

When describing the ''level'' of the audience it would help if everyone explained their terms a little more.  We all of us tend to think first of our own educational experience and terminology but very often this can be either incomprehensible or, worse, misleading to others.  I think I understand what is meant by ''primary'' here but I really don't know what ''junior college'' means.  I think that most of this book was covered in my junior high school years (1966..1969) but whether my junior high school corresponds with anyone else's I have no idea, even with England there were wide differences in terminology and organization of schools.  For the sake of comparison here are the types of educational establishments that I attended (ages in brackets): infants school (5..6), primary school (7..10), junior high school (11..13, that is first to third form), senior high school (14..18, fourth form to upper sixth), university (19..21, bachelor's degree).  My children however are attending schools described like this: grunnskole (6..12), ungdom skole (13..15), videregående skole (16..18) and might go on to any of a wide variety of further education establishments.  Grunnskole can be translated roughly as primary but note that the age range is not the same as the English one, ungdom (literally youth) as junior high school (but note that most UK schools are not divided into junior and senior high schools) and videregående (literally further going) as senior high school.  Perhaps WikiBooks needs a glossary that describes the target audiences. 
--[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:37, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:Some of our books are for specific government standards, and these can have audiences (&quot;AP&quot;, &quot;A-level&quot;, &quot;college&quot;, ...) that might not make sense in other parts of the world. Most of our books only seem to be for older students and adults in general.

:If a book claims to target a &quot;junior college&quot; (which I think is something like a junior high school or ungdom skole) then you should edit that text or use the talk page. Do you have an example of such text? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:05, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

The example that triggered my comment was the [[Talk:Algebra]] page linked in the first line of the comment.  If you look at this page: [[Algebra:Functions]] you will see a 'breadcrumb' trail at the top that clearly identifies the page as primary school mathematics.  The original discussion was about consistency and appropriate style of exposition; however, my point is that the terms used in the discussion were so poorly defined as to be misleading because they assume a common background that simply does not exist.  As for government standards such as A-level (I have three of those), etc., they are well defined in theory but how many people could state with confidence, for instance, whether A-level physics in the UK is in any way similar to VK1+VK2 fysikk in Norway without having a summary of the standards easily accessible from WikiBooks so that they could decide whether or not a book described as suitable for one would be broadly suitable for the other. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 09:12, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

::A junior college is a community college-  a 2 year college after high school.  Usually a lot of adult education courses (learn how to use MS Word, learn conversational Spanish, etc) and general education courses.  Sometimes they offer Associates degrees, they never offer Bachelor's or higher.  Generally the people going there are either just taking a course or two, or are using it to get their pre-reqs for college done (junior colleges are incredibly cheap, you can do your first 2 years there for 10% the cost, then transfer).  Level of education is generally poorer than a real college, science and math classes are laughable, but credits for english and the like will transfer to most major colleges.  Something at a junior college level is pretty much late high school/early college material, with an emphasis on practical use instead of theory. --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 10:31, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

::: That last comment can still be confusing to some:  in some countries such as Germany, what transliterates as &quot;high school&quot; is what an American would call a college.  In the US, a primary or elementary school is for about ages 6&amp;ndash;10 and is usually preceeded by a kindergarten for 5-year olds.  A US junior high school (often called a middle school) is for students about ages 11&amp;ndash;13.  A US high school is for about ages 14&amp;ndash;17.  A US college degree usually requires about 4 years with students generally starting at about age 18.  A US university offers both college and post-graduate (usually just called graduate) education, the graduate education typically ending in a masters, doctorate, law, or medical degree.  A doctorate degree is a research degree, and a masters degree is generally equivalent to the first 2 or 3 years of doctorate training.  A US junior college is in theory equivalent to the first two years of college but in practice often resembles remedial high school or training for low-level professions. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:37, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

== Arranging the Books in a PDF Format ==

Why dont we arrange the open text books on wikipedia in a PDF format also?.That would be easier to read and access and go through the part of the book.We could do this at least for the developed books.And its revised versions can br published for eg. once a month..?

-archird

:There was some earlier discussion about trying to write a MediaWiki plug-in that would allow conversion of Wikibooks content directly to PDF format.  At the moment, the only way to accomplish this is to import the pages into a word processing program like Open Office (that doesn't require any $$$ but it does take quite a bit of time to download) and then do some minor cleanup to fit more into a book format, with export to a PDF file.  That takes time.  There are several Wikibooks, however, that have done this so far as &quot;snapshots&quot; from a specific dated version of Wikibooks.

:Are you volunteering to help out with this task?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:45, 18 November 2005 (UTC)
::I'd be happy to volunteer for this task (and, indeed, have started on the Algebra WikiBook as a bit of practice). However, I would recommend LyX for this sort of thing (though it's a pain to install on Windows) because it outputs pretty LateX, which gives the ability to use the LaTeX maths stuff (and means that the alternate text for all the mathematical graphics can be used almost verbatim). In addition, I don't think a plugin would be that hard to write, provided someone who understands both the appropriate language (I can use Python, if that can be used in plugins) and LaTeX (which I am completely in the dark about).

I think we should concentrate on creating print version of our books. Look at [[Programming:Python]] and [[How To Build A Computer]] - they have automatically-updated versions designed for print. It's not hard to create such versions - I can even write a tutorial if someone has any problems, but the best way is to learn from example. Books that have this form often don't need to be converted to PDF. And even if someone wants it, it becomes very easy (you just have to convert HTML to Acrobat format). --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:11, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

I just have a couple of questions about print versions. First off, what paper size/margins should be used as standard? Secondly, what text should be included by default? Obviously the GFDL falls into this category, but how much of it and where can I get the right part(s) from? [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 01:33, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

==Disappearing User Page==
My user page [[user:lazyquasar]] that I established to begin participating in Wikiversity keeps disappearing.  Since there is no history I assume this is deletion by an administrator and not simple vandalism.  I have been getting a lot of errors while browsing the wiki and I had a link to wikipedia user page on it [[w:user:lazyquasar]] so perhaps this is a manifestation of my browser?  I am using Firefox 1.0.7.  Any assistance would be appreciated.  My wikipedia user account has a currently valid email for me.  Thanks. [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 18:33, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

==Making Wikibooks Matter==

I've been having a lot of meetings with very important people, billionaires, high level UN types, major nonprofits, and people are very very excited by the concept of Wikibooks '''as a serious project''' -- but unfortunately, the project itself has not been nearly serious enough.  So we have allowed ourselves here to become a dumping ground for nonsense that doesn't belong in Wikipedia.

This is somewhat understandable -- part of the explanation is outlined above.  The bureaucrats fell asleep, not enough admins were made.  Also, people want the project to succeed and felt that allowing people wide latitude as to what they were doing was going to be helpful.  But in fact, I think it turns out that allowing nonsense was one of the worst strategies for growth, because it has diluted the mission.

Wikipedia didn't grow because we let anyone write whatever they wanted.  Wikipedia grew becuase I was firm from the very beginning about certain core policies that defined the project in a way that lots of people can understand and support it.

SJ asks whether the problem with &quot;Get a girl&quot; was a naming issue, a content issue, or what.  The answer is yes in every regard.  It was a shocking embarassment.  It was extremely sexist (and making 4 sexist books instead of 1 is not a fit solution), it was incredibly stupid in content, it was original research, it was not a textbook, and it was a magnet for bad writing.

SJ asks as well whether a book &quot;Building Healthy Relationships&quot; or similar would be ok?  Well, perhaps but probably not.  Would such a book be NPOV?  Would it contain serious references to peer-reviewed academic research?  If so, then fine.  But a rambling book of mostly idiotic opinions is not a textbook.

It's important to understand that not every sort of book used in a classroom is a textbook.

Because of all the problems we've seen here, my recommmendation is that we pursue something like the &quot;directly enumerated&quot; policy.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 09:31, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

:Everything you said makes sense to me, except for the part about the &quot;Directly Enumerated&quot; policy.

''The next post is by [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]]. It is interrupted several times by the reply of [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]].''

:Keep in mind that the reason why Wikibooks has become a dumping ground for content from Wikipedia is because it is often &quot;forced&quot; upon us by the community '''at Wikipedia''', and in many ways we have been powerless to really stop the effort sometimes.  The Wikipedia is so large that even a small &quot;faction&quot; can swamp the efforts on the other Wikimedia sister projects, especially if language is not a barrier (like it is between Wikipedia and Wikibooks).

::Well, I'm here to defend you from that.  I would recommend starting some rules here which give differential treatment to wikibookians over wikipedians in some borderline cases.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 17:01, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

:VfD discussions come up and that large group from Wikipedia can dominate the discussions.  This issue is going to improve over time, simply because the Wikibooks community is becoming larger and more established.  Also, many of these special interest people who do come over for a specific book project end up staying on Wikibooks and helping out with other areas, and offer resistance to other Wikipedia groups trying to do the same thing.  In this case, a stronger trans-wiki policy needs to be made across all Wikimedia projects.

:There has also been a learning curve among other Wikimedia users as to what Wikibooks is all about.  I have not even completely understood the whole relationship between each one of the projects.  There is one school of thought that all of human knowledge can be found on all of the Wikimedia projects, including potentially offensive things like &quot;How to get a girl&quot; or &quot;White Nationalism&quot;.   I know that having these items becomes an embaressment when you are talking to a minister of education in some country, but other than suggesting it was against policy like a copyright violation or NPOV dispute, it is hard to find a rationale to remove the book. 

::It *is* a violation of NPOV.  If we were to have a wikibook on &quot;The history of racial movements in the United States&quot; or something like that, then that'd be great.  But a book explicitly advocating?  Absolutely not.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 17:01, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

:This is a similar issue that comes up in the USA when trying to fight pornography or publication of offensive books as well, and the same arguments come up.  Even a strict &quot;textbook only&quot; policy only offers some protection for a project like this, and in some ways only changes the format of the book, not the content.  &quot;No illegal content&quot; offers some additional protection, but at the same time, almost all content can be considered illegal in some country of the world.

::I don't think it is very similar to those issues at all.  We are a serious effort to create textbooks, not a &quot;free speech platform&quot; for people to publish whatever nonsense they like.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 17:01, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

:Some progress has been made along these lines, however.  The effort to turn Wikibooks into an incubator of new Wikimedia projects has ended, not only from general pronouncements by members of the Wikimedia Foundation board, but in actual practice as well.  There were several attempts to start a new Wikimedia project here, and it used to be a common statement on [[m:Proposals for new projects|the New Project Suggestions Page on Meta]] to start a Wikibook on the topic as a way to explore the idea.  That common suggestion has all but disappeared on that page and is no longer even recommended on the Foundation-l either when a new project suggestions comes up.

:Right now it could be argued that if a Wikipedia article exists on a topic, that it should be fair game on Wikibooks to develop a book-length project on the topic as well.  Using this argument, both &quot;How to get a girl&quot; and &quot;White Nationalism&quot; would be allowed, as long as they conform to a NPOV policy and follow the other Wikibooks policies as well without regard to content.  Similar Wikipedia articles on both topics do in fact exist.

:I also want to emphasis that these extreme books are just that.  They represent the periphery of what is being accomplished on Wikibooks, and many new very non-controvercial books like [[AP Computer Science]] are being started that represent not only the educational mission of Wikibooks, but show the potential of becoming something that we can all be very proud of.  I recently put [[Astronomy]] up as a VfD, mainly because this is an example of a textbook that needs a massive cleanup, not because it is offensive content.  That IMHO is where we should be focusing our energies and working to help improve this project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:06, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

::I absolutely agree that these books are at the periphery.  That's why they are fit to be immediately deleted.  They are totally not helpful to our mission. --[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 17:01, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

== Why I have resigned as Administrator here on Wikibooks ==
''The next post by [[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] is interrupted by...''
:''replies of [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]]...''
::::::''and reply of [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]].

[[User:Jimbo_Wales]] continues to do personal assults upon me as a person, and dispite repeated attempts at trying to get input as to why he made the decisions he has done here on this project, he continues to rail against me here.

:Where have I made any personal attack of any kind upon you?  I have been writing daily about various things regarding Wikibooks, and I am happy to continue the dialogue as long as is necessary.

Most important, as the current policy for deletion is mainly whatever Jimbo decides does not belong on Wikibooks, regardless of any other rationale or general community input on the decision.  As an administrator I cannot possibly enforce this policy mainly because of its arbitrary nature.

In addition, with the kinds of actions that he has been doing here on Wikibooks, if it were anybody else besides this person, I would be posting a notice on the [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions|Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]] page asking for de-adminship of this user, for several reasons.  Arbitrarily deleting content that is already under a [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion|vote for deletion]] that is still being decided and has ongoing comments, especially multiple instances, would be a major factor.  Publicly threating to block users, especially specific users, is another major factor.  Making policy decisions without community comment is still another.

Basically, I am right now in an edit war with Jimbo, and I know I'm on the losing side of that fight.  I am trying to stand up to this individual who IMHO is abusing his position, and has apparently little understanding of how to run a volunteer organization.  Attacking individuals who are making genuine contributions is not a way to grow a volunteer organization.  Having arbitrary policies and policy changes without apparent cause or rationale is still another way to cause the people you are &quot;leading&quot; to lose faith in you.

:We are not in an edit war of any kind.  In order to have an edit war, it takes two parties, and I am not going to take part in an edit war.

Also, I see little content that is currently safe here on Wikibooks.  There is no more point in my making any more contributions here as I feel that it is just as likely, perhaps even more likely due to my public dispute with Mr. Wales, to be removed or essentially made irrelevant.

:I do not see us as being in any sort of public dispute at all.  I very warmly encourage you to continue the dialogue, since as far as I can tell, we are on the same side on every substantive issue.

Wikibooks is an awsome project, and it will likely survive this current spat.  Still, I can't in all honesty continue here, and as long as Mr. Wales decides to run this project with an iron fist, I can't continue to advocate for those individuals who feel that they are being run roughshod by other admins and people in &quot;higher power&quot; within this project.  Wikibooks is a lesser place than it was, and the damage has been done.

:What 'iron fist'?  No one has been blocked, no pages have been protected, there have been no edit wars.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 03:13, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

::Rob, the point of WikiMedia is to create a &quot;better solution.&quot;  Jimbo has certainly done that.  It isn't a perfect solution, but I think that even you would agree that it is better than anything else the world has ever known for the purposes it espouses.  As such, I personally support any system that is a step in the right direction.  You can't expect the hierarchical system used throughout the ages to be replaced by equality overnight.  Refusing to back down, even when you know that you will lose, is a sign of integrity and I have respected you for that for some time.  Your integrity has inspired many others to take a stand and fight for equality too.  If you stick to your principles and post a notice on the [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]] page asking for de-adminship of Jimbo, you will be saying that you consider him to be an equal in this project.  When enough people consider Jimbo to be an equal, he will be free to assume that role.  Until that time, for the stability of WikiMedia, he has no choice but to assume the role we give him.  --[[User:Zephram Stark|Zephram Stark]] 03:20, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

==Wikiprojects for bookshelves?==

I've been reading wikipedia lately, and have been introduced to the concept of WikiProjects-  groups of people dedicated to improving articles related to a topic.  I'm wondering if an equivalent wouldn't be a good idea for wikibooks.  I see a lot of books where content is duplicated, in many cases poorly.  Or where 1 book tries to hold the entirety of a large subject, and ends up becoming a survey of the subject rather than a good text on one topic of it.  The bookshelf that I saw that drove me to this post was Math, but I'm sure its happening in them all.  I wonder if a place where editors on a subject could talk, ask for help, give suggestions, etc would help improve the average quality of the books.  Does this make sense to anyone else? --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 20:17, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

: Certainly sounds an idea, especially if it makes compiling a book less likely to stall (as currently seems to be the case with [[Wikijunior Solar System]]...) &amp;nbsp;[[User:David Kernow|David Kernow]] 20:51, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

::I wonder if we should rework the general philosophies here that instead Wikibooks bookshelves '''become''' Wikiprojects.  This is ''Wikibook bookshelves as Wikiprojects''.  Each bookshelf has its own discussion page, and is in many ways just like a portal for many Wikiprojects on Wikipedia as well.  It isn't a perfect fit, but it is a way that you can get several like-minded individuals to work together.  Also, even each seperate Wikibook is more organized along the lines of a Wikiproject on Wikipedia anyway, so this is more a meta-project space as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:18, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

:How do you define completed?  For some books it isn't too difficult: a high school textbook, say [[FHSST Physics]], is complete when it covers the official national (in this case South African) syllabus.  But for others such as [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic|Visual_Basic_Classic]] which is an evolving text treating programming through VB6/5 it is much more difficult because no one declared a list of topics to be covered at the beginning.  In fact it is something that I have on my to do list: an outline of the book briefly listing what it ''is'' and is ''not'' intended to cover.

== FREE textbooks... can/should they be integrated into Wikibooks? ==

[http://www.textbookrevolution.org/ Textbook Revolution] (http://www.textbookrevolution.org/) has a lot of Creative Commons licenced books on various topics.

[http://www.motionmountain.net/ Motion Mountain] (http://www.motionmountain.net/) is a free [[Physics]] textbook, but is copyrighted, and so it might not be able to be part of Wikibooks.

::I would say that unless someone wants to make significant changes to them they do not belong on Wikibooks.  On the other hand if they are good and there is a risk that they might disappear from their original home then they could be copied to Wikisource.

So much that is decided and done around here is based on policies that have never been established. The list is on [[User:Lord Voldemort|my user page]] if you would like to see it. I know some of the policies are perhaps briefly mentioned in other policies, but they should really be explicitly spelled out for people to be able to read and understand. I would appreciate any comments. Thanks. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:27, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

:I looked at most of them, and cast my votes on the ones that had open voting. I think that many of these pages arent particularly needed right now at wikibooks, but many of them definately could be of use. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 22:36, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

::''Some'' may not be absolutely necessary right now, but as WB grows, it is important to have policies decided upon and enforced, or else we fall into the whole &quot;Wikibooks is only for textbooks&quot; thing. Right now there is no policy even saying Admins can block or ban people. I think this needs to be reconciled. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:44, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

== Dispute resolution ==

How is the best way to handle disputes here at Wikibooks? I know the dispute resolution process over at Wikipedia, but am unable to find one here. I don't see Wikibooks as needing anything close to the level of processes over at WP, but I think it is necessary to establish some sort of process early enough before we really need it. I would be interested in working on some sort of dispute resolution process development with a few other people if WB doesn't already have something in place. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:30, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

:What kinds of disputes are you talking about? I guess we dont have much mechanism to solve problems, but it also hasnt come up much before. you could author a new policy on dispute resolution if you have the time and inclination. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 22:34, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

Like if two editors have a fight, or an Admin wrongly blocked someone, or a module is in a constant edit war and needs a third opinion. Basically how are we supposed to solve problems that come up? Eventually bringing problems to the Staff Lounge will be unmanagable. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:47, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

Not exactly the dispute resolution ''process'' I was looking for. If I have any time, I'll draft up something more like I had in mind. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:34, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

==Answers to copyrighted textbooks==
I'm not really sure on this one. Would a WikiBook of detailed methods to solve the questions in a specific copyrighted textbook be legal/appropriate on WikiBooks? I only ask because I already have quite a lot of Maths work already in a TeX'd maths format, which would seem a shame to waste if this would be OK. [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 14:31, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

== The Fleecing of Students with Textbook Buyback Programs ==

Greetings,

I was wondering if there are any organized attempts to increase the amount offered for used textbooks when students attempt to sell them back at the end of the semester; and/or controls on publishers making new editions for minor changes within current editions for the purpose of putting a new product on the shelf?  As a student, it's not uncommon to hear each semester of students forced to take a tremendous loss on a book in excellent condition, for a new edition of the same book with only minor changes or renumbered homework problems.  I'm sure there are others out there that see something wrong with this system.  Any feedback...

Kim, AKA, &quot;Baffled Oldtimer&quot;

:One solution is not to buy the books in the first place, and do all your reading on wikibooks! Seriously though, the college textbook market is a travesty of the educational system. Worse then the publishers putting out new versions every year on 100$ books are the professors who insist that the students buy the current version each year, so that all the page numbers line up. I've had 2 professors in my educational career that actually authored their own textbooks, and threatened to fail any students that didnt buy the current version at the beginning of each semester. It's all a shame, That's why i spend so much of my time contributing to wikibooks: because I want to try and alleviate this problem for future generations of students. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 19:06, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

::'Tis a shame ''and'' a sham. I remember being so excited to get back 40 bucks on 300 dollars worth of new textbooks that were barely touched. I think it has somehting to do with the monopoly some book distributors have on buy-back programs. It might be wise to look into starting a selling program at your school to buy books back from students at a little more than currently offered, and then sell them back to students taking the class next year at a lower price than the bookstore. Not really sure what to do with classes requiring new textbooks every year though. Perhaps just use Half.com or the like. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:21, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

:What I did was use college newsgroups and similar free advertising sources to announce the books I had, and offer them at a fiar price.  Generally I split the difference between the cost of a used book at the bookstore and the price they were buying used books for.  I made a bit of cash, he saved a bit, we both went away happy. --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 21:14, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

::I used a combination of techniques and probably spent no more than $300 on textbooks my last two years of college:
::*See if the professor has a copy available on reserve at the library. If not, ask them to put a copy on reserve. Some will, some won't. Usually that will allow you to check it out for a few hours at a time. Beware, though, this can get frustrating during finals week.
::*If you have a friend (or friends) in the class, split the cost or borrow the book.
::*If you won't have to *turn in* homework problems, get an old edition. Sure some of the stuff is different, but it's good enough to pass the tests. Ask former students who will usually sell dirt cheap, go to the discontinued section of your bookstore (they're often steeply discounted, as in 90% off), or look in the library for an old edition.
::*Even if you will have to turn it in, buy an old version, then borrow a new version from a fellow student for a day and photocopy just the homework problems. I believe that's fair use. And if anyone argues it isn't, smile and nod (and do it anyway). Another alternative (for non-shrinkwrapped books) is to buy it, copy the homework problems, and return it.
::*If there's no alternative market at your school for used textbooks, create one! Post up billboards all around the campus with a catchy marketing message such as &quot;Screw the bookstore before they screw you!&quot; then below it, in smaller print, &quot;Buy and sell your books directly to other students to avoid giving the fat pigs at the bookstore a chance to profit off starving students such as yourself.&quot; Then end with a website: groups.yahoo.com/U-Mich-Used-Books, and watch the traffic start to come in. Of course, you'll have to create the group first and write a simple introductory message.
::Maybe somebody can make a wikibook out of this.--[[User:Aaronsama|Aaronsama]] 16:00, 1 December 2005 (UTC)
::I actually keep about 8 out of 10 textbooks I've purchased, and only sell the ones back for dead-end courses. It's a pretty good idea to keep textbooks in your field of study, as they can be good references for future coursework, study guides in general, or just plain relics. I also do tutoring in Accounting at a community college and have an old edition of the textbook in use there--the text material is identical (with the exception of the combination of chapters one and two - which threw off all the page numbers) but the problems are different, which gives me a good amount of supplemental study material to give to my tutees.

== Reiki ==

Is it OK for Wikibooks to have a book on how to do [[w:reiki|reiki]]? [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 22:24, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

:As long as it is written as a textbook, that should be fine. Maybe start an overall book of Holistics or Natural Medicine and have that as a section? Just my thoughts though. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:32, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

No, I have no interest in Reiki, it's a lot of crap, but I know someone who '''might'''. I just don't want to tell him he can write it and then see his work deleted. [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 02:30, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

:Well as long as it is written as a textbook, it should be fine. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:10, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

:Exactly. So long as it's a textbook, and it doesnt violate the NPOV or soapbox rules, then it should be okay. Just tell your friend to keep his sentences in the form &quot;Reiki is performed as such...&quot;, and not &quot;Reiki is super awesome because...&quot; or even &quot;Reiki is better then the following things...&quot;. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 20:36, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] has returned to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|the Dursleys]] for the summer holiday, and things are hardly going well. On Harry's birthday, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] berates and shouts at Harry during breakfast, triggered by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] commanding Harry to pass him the bacon. Harry retorts that Dudley forgot to say the magic word. Merely mentioning the word magic is enough to send Uncle Vernon into a towering rage. 

Uncle Vernon launches into his plans for that evening, entertaining a prospective client, Mr. Mason. Harry's role is simple: he will remain in his room, making no noise, pretending not to be there.

While in the yard later that day, Harry, looking at the hedge, sees two large, green eyes staring back at him. Before he can investigate further, Dudley nastily reminds Harry it is his birthday and asks why all his &quot;weird friends&quot; have not bothered to send any cards or presents. In retaliation, Harry says he is trying to magically set the garden hedge on fire, though he privately remembers that underage wizards are forbidden to practice magic outside school. Dudley tattles to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]], and, as a punishment for mentioning magic, Harry must clean the house all day.

That evening, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mr. Mason|Mr.]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Mason|Mrs. Mason]] arrive, Harry is sent to his bedroom. Harry is shocked to find someone sitting on the bed.

== Analysis ==

As will become the series' usual framework, the first chapter recaps the previous book, while the Dursleys, earlier called &quot;the ''worst'' sort of Muggles&quot; by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], reinforce the contrast between Harry's magical world and his family's mundane Muggle household. Although Harry now has his own bedroom (Dudley's &quot;spare&quot; one) rather than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 2|sleeping in the cupboard under the stairs]], his overall life has hardly improved. Here, we see how his enforced non-magical life causes him spiritual poverty and deprivation, as he endures the long weeks before he can return to school. He is still physically mistreated, being nearly starved while Dudley grows even fatter. The Dursleys, crueler than ever, make his life as miserable as they can away from Hogwarts, a place he not only loves but represents a world where he is not only celebrated for his (unwanted) fame, but valued for his own self and individual talents. In the Wizarding world, he is among his own kind, and is not considered as a freak. However, once he returns to Privet Drive, his magical abilities again make him strange and abnormal to his family, and anything tying him to that world is forbidden or securely locked away. Even [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] must remain in her cage. 

Harry has coped with his abusive treatment in various ways: by ignoring his family as they ignore him, and occasionally standing up for himself. A slight change in Harry's personality can be seen here, however. A year ago, his rebellions were limited to minor jabs at Dudley; he would never have deliberately provoked Vernon or Petunia, fearing reprisals. Now he deliberately taunts them. Harry's demeanor and self-confidence will continue to develop throughout the series, and his position within the household gradually changes as Harry becomes less passive-aggressive and more assertive in his self-defence. It is also gradually dawning on him that being a wizard makes him a powerful being that his family will eventually come to fear. Undermining all this right now is Harry's unhappy homelife being made even more glum when it seems his new-found Hogwarts friends have already abandoned him. 

Another aspect of the Dursleys is exposed&amp;mdash;they are scheming social climbers. Their ambitious plans for entertaining the Masons, as we, and Harry, see, are extremely sycophantic, and would irritate any person with even a near-average intelligence. One wonders how Vernon was ever able to earn a living, if this represents the quality of his sales pitch. This also indicates Vernon's shallow thought processes. Believing that he would like to be treated in such a condescending manner, he assumes Mr. Mason would prefer the same.

It is unknown yet who or what the green eyes belong to, but it is likely related to the Wizarding realm creeping into Harry's enforced Muggle confinement. Whether or not there is any imminent danger to Harry remains to be seen, though he is alert to that possibility.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===
# Have Dudley, Uncle Vernon, and Aunt Petunia changed from the previous year? If so, how?
# Why is Harry's even mentioning the word &quot;magic&quot; sufficient reason for him to be punished?

=== Further Study ===
# Harry notices large, green eyes staring at him from the hedge. What or who might Harry think this could be?
# Why have Harry's friends not written and ignored his birthday?
# Now that Harry has completed his first year at Hogwarts, has his relationship with the Dursleys changed? If so, how? Explain how and why it might continue to change.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The green eyes in the hedge belong to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|House-elf]]. Dobby will be an important character in this book and throughout the series.

This chapter focuses on the Dursleys, Harry's family that he must live with each summer. We see how they remain stolidly pinned to the fabric of everyday Muggle life, and are slaves to the impression they can make on their neighbours and associates. As the series progresses, we will see some positive character growth and change in cousin Dudley, as he eventually realizes there may be some good in magic, and even in Harry. Vernon and Petunia will remain stubbornly convinced that magic is an abomination, although, over time, we will see that their distaste becomes overwhelmed by fear. Petunia's hatred of the Wizarding world is actually motivated by jealousy and rejection, as revealed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|in the last book]]. Vernon likely became Petunia's husband because he was the least magical person she could find.

===Connections===

* We learn [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 37|much later]] why Harry had to return to the Dursleys every summer: the protection that had resulted from his mother dying for him would only remain in force as long as he had a home protected by his mother's blood, in this case Petunia. While this protection remains with Harry into the seventh book of the series, it is only in the fifth book that it is explained. And while the protection in question underpins the entire series, it is only in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] that it is explicitly mentioned.</text>

==Forced Draws?==
In the section on the game ending, it appears to say that the game is drawn for insufficient material, 50 moves without a capture, etc. ''only if one of the players declares the game a draw''.  I was under the impression that this drew the game whether a player declared it drawn or not.  Which is it?  If the first one is correct, I'll leave it as it is, if the second version is correct I'll change the wording to be clearer.


[[Image:SCD_castle_kingside.png|frame|right|Kingside castling: O-O]]
[[Image:SCD_castle_queenside.png|frame|right|Queenside castling: O-O-O]]
==Castling ==
As I am new here (although not new to Wikipedia) I'll post this on the talk page. I believe it is easier for students (new chess players) to learn and remember Castling if it is said somehow differently:
: ''A player moves his rook to the first free square next to the king, and subsequently, on the same turn, move the king to the first free square next to the rook (both king and queenside)''.
I also made new pictures that show this, if you don't like that you may revert the previous versions. BTW great job for the chess manual, thumbs up, keep up the good work. --[[User:5ko|5ko]] 01:14, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

In chess you should move the piece you touch. If you move the rook first it is an ambigous move. You could mean to move the rook only and you could mean to castle. Therefore you should always move the king first, two places towards the rook. In that case it evident that your move could only be castling.
::I think the original way is clearer.  It's easier to remember that castling starts by the king moving two squares either left or right. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 10:15, 31 January 2006 (UTC)

==Regarding Kings==
I've played a few casual games where we agreed that my opponent or I could move his/my King adajacent to my/his King if my/his King would place itself in check if it captured his/my King.  Is this an exception to the &quot;the Kings may not be adajacent to each other&quot; rule?  Or is our logic flawed?--[[User:SimRPGman|SimRPGman]] 08:54, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

No it is never allowed for two kings to be adjacent. (In blitzchess it actually happens because of the hurry of the players and the first player to see it can take the others king)

jkanters


There's an error in diagram Chess_d44.png, showing a King's possible moves.  The diagram shows d5 as an available move, but that square is covered by the Queen.</text>

{|
|[[Image:Trigonometry_triangle.svg|right|200px|thumb]]
We use the triangle on the left to define the three basic trigonometric ratios, using angle A. A good mnemonic is the acronym SOHCAHTOA, Sin Opposite Hypotenuse, Cosine Adjacent Hypotenuse, Tangent Opposite Adjacent. Remember if you are using a calculator to obtain the value of a trigonometric ratio make sure that it is in the proper mode; it should be in radian mode if the angle is in radians and degree mode if the angle is in degrees. You can find the angle that corresponds to a value using the inverse of each function usually listed as &lt;math&gt;\cos ^{-1}, \sin ^{-1}, \tan ^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; on your calculator, a formal discussion of the inverse trigonometric functions will be in Core 3. The vertical blue dashed lines in the tangent graph are the asymptotes of the tangent function. The tangent function will not be defined at these points because at these points the cosine graph is zero, see the tangent identity.

== The CAST Model ==
{|
|[[Image:CAST.png|250px|right|thumb]]
The Cast Model is used to show in which quadrant a trigonometric ratio will be positive. A mnemonic is All Students Take Core 4. The four indicates that Cosine is in the fourth quadrant. Also you need to know that sin(''x'') = sin(π rad  or 180° - ''x'') = ''c'', cos(''x'') = cos(2π rad or 360° - ''x'') = ''c'', and tan(''x'') = tan(π rad or 180° + ''x'')= ''c''. This is important to remember because if  sin(''x'') = 1/2, and it is between 0° and 360° then x can be 30° or 150°.

== The Law of Cosines ==
[[Image:Theorem_of_cosin.svg|right|300px]]Pythagoras theory only applies to right triangles, the law of cosines will apply to any triangle. When you have a right triangle it reduces to the same formula as given by Pythagoras theorem. For any triangle ABC with angle measurement &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and sides of length a,b,c.


{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;a^2=b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos \alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;b^2=a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cos \beta \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;c^2=a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos \gamma \,&lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

'''Example'''

What is the value of ''c'' when ''a'' = 4 cm, ''b'' = 8 cm, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;64^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;c^2=4^2 + 8^2 - 2 \times 4 \times 8 \cos 64^\circ \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;c^2 = 53\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;c \approx 7.28\ cm&lt;/math&gt;

== The Law of Sines ==
For any triangle ABC with angle measurement &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and sides of length a,b,c.

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;\frac {a}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{b}{\sin \beta} = \frac {c}{\sin \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

'''Example'''
If Angle ''&amp;alpha;'' is &lt;math&gt;45^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, Angle ''&amp;beta;'' is &lt;math&gt;24^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and Side ''b'' is 3 cm, what is the length of side ''a''?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac {a}{\sin 45^\circ} = \frac{3}{\sin 24^\circ}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a \times \sin 24^\circ = 3 \times \sin 45^\circ&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a= \frac{3 \times \sin 45^\circ}{\sin 24^\circ} \approx 5.22\ \mbox{cm}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

== Area of a Triangle ==
For any triangle the area is one-half the product of two sides with the sine of the included angle.  If the included angle is a right angle, then this reduces to the formula for the area of a right triangle, since &lt;math&gt;\sin 90^\circ= 1&lt;/math&gt;

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin \alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}ac \sin \beta \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin \gamma \,&lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

'''Example:'''&lt;p&gt;
What is the area of triangle when ''a'' = 4 cm, ''b'' = 8 cm, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;20^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}\times 4 \times 8 \times \sin 20^\circ\, \approx 5.47\ \mbox{cm}^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

== Pythagoras Identity ==
{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;\sin ^2 \theta + \cos ^2 \theta = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

Proof:&lt;p&gt;
We use the pythagorean theory:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now we divide by &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac {a^2}{c^2} + \frac {b^2}{c^2} = \frac {c^2}{c^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We get:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac {a^2}{c^2} + \frac {b^2}{c^2} = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We can write this as:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sin ^2 \theta + \cos ^2 \theta = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A good way to think of this of is &lt;math&gt;opposite^2 + adjacent^2 = hypotenuse^2 = \frac{opposite^2}{hypotenuse^2} + \frac{adjacent^2}{hypotenuse^2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;


===A Practical Example===
Find all the  values of x between 0 rad and 2π rad  that satisfy the relationship &lt;math&gt;15\sin^2\left(x\right) = \cos\left(x\right) + 13&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Using the Pythagoras Identity we get:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;15\left(1 - \cos^2\left(x\right)\right) = \cos\left(x\right) + 13&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now we can simplify:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;15\cos^2\left(x\right) - \cos\left(x\right) - 2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is more covinent to replace cos(x) with u:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;15u^2 - u - 2 = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then we factor the expression&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left(5u + 2\right)\left(3u - 1\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\cos\left(x\right) = \frac{-2}{5}\ or\ \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In order to determine what x is we need to use &lt;math&gt;\cos^{-1}\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; on our calculators.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{-2}{5}\right) \approx 1.9823\ rad&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx 1.2310\ rad&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But we need to remember that in the interval 2π the cosine function will have the same in 2π - x.&lt;p&gt;
2π rad - 1.2310 rad = 5.0222 rad&lt;p&gt;
2π rad - 1.9823 rad = 4.3009 rad&lt;p&gt;
So the complete answer is 1.2310 rad, 1.9823 rad, 4.3009 rad, and 5.0222 rad.

== Tangent Identity ==
{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;
{{TrigBoxClose}}

Proof:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by c&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac {\frac {a}{c}}{ \frac {b}{c}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We can write this as:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

=== Example ===
sin(x) = 4cos(x) solve for sin(x). All units are in radians.&lt;p&gt;
We divide both sides by cos x and we get the identity&lt;p&gt;
tan(x)=4&lt;p&gt;
We use the &lt;math&gt;tan^{-1}(x) &lt;/math&gt; to get that x = 1.3258 rad.&lt;p&gt;
Now we can solve for sin(x):&lt;p&gt;
sin(x) = 4cos(1.3258 rad) = 4*.2425 rad = .9701 rad .

There are a number of different operations that can be performed on discrete data sets.

== Arithmetic ==

Let's say that we have 2 data sets, A[n] and B[n]. We will define these two sets to have the following values:

 A[n] = [W X&amp; Y Z]
 B[n] = [I J&amp; K L]

Arithmetic operations on discrete data sets are performed on an item-by-item basis. Here are some examples:

=== Addition ===

 A[n] + B[n] = [(W+I) (X+J)&amp; (Y+K) (Z+L)]

If the zero positions don't line up (like they conveniently do in our example), we need to manually line up the zero positions before we add.

=== Subtraction ===

 A[n] - B[n] = [(W-I) (X-J)&amp; (Y-K) (Z-L)]

Same as addition, only we subtract.

=== Multiplication ===

In this situation, we are using the &quot;asterisk&quot; (*) to denote multiplication. Realistically, we should use the &quot;&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;&quot; symbol for multiplication. In later examples, we will use the asterisk for other operations.

 A[n] * B[n] = [(W*I) (X*J)&amp; (Y*K) (Z*L)]

=== Division ===

 A[n] / B[n] = [(W/I) (X/J)&amp; (Y/K) (Z/L)]

Even though we are using the square brackets for discrete data sets, they should NOT be confused with matrices. These are not matrices, and we do not perform matrix operations on these sets.

== Time-Shifting ==

If we time-shift a discrete data set, we essentially are moving the zero-time reference point of the set. The zero point represents &quot;now&quot;, creates the starting point of our view of the data, and the point's location is typically established by a need of the processing we're involved in.

Let's say we have the data set F[n] with the values:

 F[n] = [1 2 3&amp; 4 5 ]

Then we can shift this set backwards by 1 data point as such:

 F[n-1] = [1 2&amp; 3 4 5]

We can shift the data forward by 1 data point in a similar manner:

 F[n+1] = [1 2 3 4&amp; 5]

Discrete data values are time oriented. Values to the right of the zero point are called &quot;future values&quot;, and values to the left are &quot;past values&quot;. When the data set is populated on both sides of the zero reference, &quot;future&quot; and &quot;past&quot; are synthetic terms relative to the zero point &quot;now&quot;, and don't refer to current physical time. In this context, the data values have already been collected and, as such, can only come from our past.

It is important to understand that a physically-realizable digital system that is still receiving data cannot perform operations on future values. It makes no sense to require a future value in order to make a calculation, because such systems are often getting input from a sensor in real-time, and future values simply don't exist.

== Time Inversion ==

Let's say that we have the same data set, F[n]:

 F[n] = [1 2 3&amp; 4 5]

We can invert the data set as such:

 F[-n] = [5 4 3&amp; 2 1]

We keep the zero point in the same place, and we flip all the data items around. in essence, we are taking a mirror image of the data set, and the zero point is the mirror.

== Convolution ==
{{Matlab CMD|conv}}
Convolution is a much easier operation in the discrete time domain than in the continuous time domain. Let's say we have two data sets, A[n] and B[n]:

 A[n] = [1&amp; 0 1 2]
 B[n] = [2&amp; 2 2 1]

We will denote convolution with the asterisk (*) in this section; it isn't &quot;multiplication&quot; here. Our convolution function is shown like this:
 Y[n] = A[n] * B[n]
and it specifies that we will store our convolution values in the set named Y[n].

Convolution is performed by following a series of steps involving both sets of data points.
First, we time invert one of the data sets. It doesn't matter which one, so we can pick the easiest choice:

 A[n]  = [1&amp; 0 1 2]
 B[-n] = [1 2 2 2&amp;]

Next, we line up the data vertically so that only one data item overlaps:

 A[n]  -&gt;       [1&amp; 0 1 2]
 B[-n] -&gt; [1 2 2 2&amp;]

Now, we are going to zero-pad both sets, making them equal length, putting zeros in open positions as needed:

 A[n]  -&gt; [0 0 0 1&amp; 0 1 2]
 B[-n] -&gt; [1 2 2 2&amp; 0 0 0]

Now, we will multiply the contents of each column, and add them together:

 A[n]  -&gt; [0 0 0 1&amp; 0 1 2]
 B[-n] -&gt; [1 2 2 2&amp; 0 0 0]
 Y[m] = &lt;math&gt;1 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

This gives us the first data point: Y[m] = [2].

Next, we need to time shift B[-n] forward in time by one point, and do the same process: multiply the columns, and add:

 A[n]    -&gt; [0 0 0 1&amp; 0  1 2]
 B[-n-1] -&gt;   [1 2 2  2&amp; 0 0 0]
 Y[m+1] = &lt;math&gt;1 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

Repeat the &quot;time shift, multiply, and add&quot; steps until no more data points overlap.

 A[n]    -&gt; [0 0 0 1&amp; 0 1  2]
 B[-n-2] -&gt;     [1 2  2 2&amp; 0 0 0]
 Y[m+2] = &lt;math&gt;1 \times 2 + 1 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

 A[n]    -&gt; [0 0 0 1&amp; 0 1 2]
 B[-n-3] -&gt;       [1  2 2 2&amp; 0 0 0]
 Y[m+3] = &lt;math&gt;1 \times 1 + 1 \times 2 + 2 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

 A[n]    -&gt; [0 0 0 1&amp; 0 1 2]
 B[-n-4] -&gt;          [1 2 2 2&amp; 0 0 0]
 Y[m+4] = &lt;math&gt;1 \times 2 + 2 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

 A[n]  -&gt; [0 0 0 1&amp; 0 1 2]
 B[-n] -&gt;            [1 2 2 2&amp; 0 0 0]
 Y[m+5] = &lt;math&gt;1 \times 1 + 2 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

 A[n]    -&gt; [0 0 0 1&amp; 0 1 2]
 B[-n+6] -&gt;              [1 2 2 2&amp; 0 0 0]
 Y[m+6] = &lt;math&gt;1 \times 2&lt;/math&gt;

Now we have our full set of data points, Y[m]:

 Y[m] = [2 2 4 7 6 5 2]

We have our values, but where do we put the zero point? It turns out that the zero point of the result occurs where the zero points of the two operands overlapped in our shift calculations. The result set becomes:

 Y[n] = [2&amp; 2 4 7 6 5 2]

It is important to note that the length of the result set is the sum of the lengths of the unpadded operands, minus 1. Or, if you prefer, the length of the result set is the same as either of the zero-padded sets (since they are equal length).

== Discrete Operations in Matlab/Octave ==

These discrete operations can all be performed in Matlab, using special operators. 

;Division and Multiplication : Matlab is matrix-based, and therefore the normal multiplication and division operations will be the matrix operations, which are not what we want to do in DSP. To multiply items on a per-item basis, we need to prepend the operators with a period. For instance:

 Y = X .* H  %X times H 
 Y = X ./ H  %X divided by H

If we forget the period, Matlab will attempt a matrix operation, and will alert you that the dimensions of the matrixes are incompatible with the operator.

;Convolution : The convolution operation can be performed with the '''conv''' command in Matlab. For instance, if we wanted to compute the convolution of X[n] and H[n], we would use the following Matlab code:

 Y = conv(X, H);

or

 Y = conv(H, X);

== Difference Calculus ==

When working with discrete sets, you might wonder exactly how we would perform calculus in the discrete time domain. In fact, we should wonder if calculus as we know it is possible at all! It turns out that in the discrete time domain, we can use several techniques to approximate the calculus operations of differentiation and integration. We call these techniques '''Difference Calculus'''.

=== Derivatives ===

What is differentiation exactly? In the continuous time domain, the derivative of a function is the slope of the function at any given point in time. To find the derivative, then, of a discrete time signal, we need to find the slope of the discrete data set.

The data points in the discrete time domain can be treated as geometrical points, and we know that any two points define a unique line. We can then use the algebraic equation to solve for the slope, m, of the line:

:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{\Delta f(t)}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, in the discrete time domain, f(t) is sampled and replaced by F[n]. We also know that in discrete time, the difference in time between any two points is exactly 1 unit of time! With this mind, we can plug these values into our above equation:

:&lt;math&gt;m = \frac{\Delta F\left[n\right]}{1}&lt;/math&gt;

or simply:

:&lt;math&gt;m = F\left[n+1\right] - F\left[n\right]&lt;/math&gt;

We can then time-shift the entire equation one point to the left, so that our equation doesn't require any future values:

:&lt;math&gt;m = F\left[n\right] - F\left[n-1\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative can be found by subtracting time-shifted (delayed) versions of the function from itself.

=== Difference Calculus Equations ===

Difference calculus equations are arithmetic equations, with a few key components. Let's take an example:

:&lt;math&gt;Y\left[n\right] = X\left[n\right] - 2X\left[n-1\right] + 5X\left[n-2\right]&lt;/math&gt;

We can see in this equation that X[n-1] has a coefficient of 2, and X[n-2] has a coefficient of 5. In difference Calculus, the coefficients are known as &quot;tap weights&quot;. We will see why they are called tap weights in later chapters about digital filters.</text>

In Devanagari, the placement of consonants in alphabetical order are horizontally grouped vaguely in accordance with ''the body part where their sounds originate from.''

The meaning of phrase I have italicised is not obvious.

== Teaching Devanagari ==

I would really like to see lessons teaching how to read and write Devanagari step-by-step. It's too hard to learn from an overview of letters. Lack of examples is another problem, but even if there were examples afterwards the learning situation would be far from perfect because the student would still have to memorise all letters at once in order to be able to begin practising. 

What I have found really useful when learning non-Latin alphabets is a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; method that introduces few letters at a time and offers example words for practise immediately after each letter / each set of letters. What's even better is if those example words are understandable without prior knowledge of the language, that is, international words. For example: names of countries, cities or famous people (if their name isn't spelled significantly different in Devanagari than in English), common personal names, Indian words that have entered English, English words that are used in Indian languages, words that both have derived from Greek or Latin...  The advantage of using these words is that students will be able to quickly see their own progress and the whole learning process becomes as fascinating as solving a puzzle. See the &quot;Read Write and Pronounce Greek&quot; lessons in the [[Modern Greek]] Wikibook for an example, or [http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/alphabet.html this external page on Cyrillic]. 

If you'd like to try this approach for teaching how to write Devanagari, I'd be glad to help you, even though I don't know it yet (I'd learn it though and I have learned a variety of foreign alphabets already). Just create a big list of suitable words on a planning page like [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]], answer me here and I'll try to find an optimal order for letters. 

Thanks for your efforts to teach a language that is hard to find in European schools!

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 16:42, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

P.S.: If there's somebody generally unsure about how to create good language lessons, I really recommend reading the following two pages about it: [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] and [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks/Bite-sized language lessons]].

== Ligatures Chart ==

Isn't the section on ligatures a bit misleading? There is a chart showing, for example, 'kakAra + virAma + akAra = kakAra', which, if you stop to think about it, doesn't make much sense. A kAra includes the vocal 'a', and virAma is added to the sign to remove it and obtain a 'crude' consonant. The way it is now, it basically says '2 + -1 + 1 = 2'.

----
Please check this entry - पित (pati, husband) should this be spelled पति ? Thanks ....


----

Uh, the spelling for the word &quot;pati, husband&quot; is पित and not पति . Most of the words with &quot;ि &quot; were wrongly spelled so I corrected them, having nothing better to do.

The &quot;ि &quot; is called &quot;hraswa E&quot; or short E. The ि  is placed before a consonant as in पित and not पति which is nonsensical and to a native speaker of Nepali, Hindi etc., a mistake made in primary school.

I'll include some examples.

क  + ि  = िक

क  +  ी = की

Some other mistakes that I found were to the tune of:

टिका which should have been िटका (tika)

ट + ि  = िट

क + ा = का

Something like िका does not make sense.

If you want to write something that sounds like &quot;ki-aa&quot; you write िकआ. Please note that I made up this word.

Also, the above consonants, before the vowels are added to them are written with a small hyphen like mark under them like in क् called &quot;halanta&quot;. I did not do so becuase I find it difficult to 

type in Devnagari and the idea of copy pasting the little bugger every time came to my idea as I finish this paragraph.

Edit 1: There are other other mistakes like  पति  at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hindi:Family_relations which I'm convinced you enthusiasts will correct.

Edit 2: I find out lack of something called &quot;rendering support&quot; in my browser has been letting me down, displaying things like पति  .

== Short i (ि) and rendering support ==

Some browsers (including, in my experience, Firefox on Linux) lack rendering support and will in particular not display the devanagari short i correctly. This may lead contributors to mess up the text in good faith, thinking they are fixing it. I just reverted a series of such edits.
If this: पण्डित reads like the word &quot;pandit&quot;, then your browser renders Indic text correctly.
[[User:Linzer|Linzer]] 05:25, 6 November 2007 (UTC)

The word pati, husband, should be spelled as पति and NOT पित which would make it pit. (entry in the third paragraph below the ligatures chart).</text>

== Order ==
Perhaps these should be sorted by part of speech and meaning, rather than alphabetically. [[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 05:58, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

== bad, bad idea ==

I was astonished to find such an alphabetical list of words titled as &quot;lesson 4&quot;. That title gives the impression of a serious lesson to be used to seriously learn a language. I dont see this is the case with this article. I know it says &quot;These memory aids aren't true! They're nonsense made up to help you remember the meanings of Russian words&quot; but then the article should not be titled as &quot;lesson 4&quot; And actually I dont see the use of nonsense memory aids. There are two things about this list I would like to criticise.

1) I criticise aide memoire as used in this article. Let me tell you why by using an example:

&lt;strong&gt;Где;	 	Where;	G'dyeh;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Australians are always late. The Australian greeting &quot;G'day&quot; doesn't mean &quot;Good day,&quot; it means &quot;Where were you?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;

The first line is alright. There you have the russian word, the translation and an attempt to write the soundprofile in english. 
It is the second line I dont think is suitable. I think it makes the process of learning a language more difficult than necessary. What do australians have to do with russian? What does &quot;G`day&quot; have to do with Где? These are associations you dont need because they are meaningless.  

What in fact will happen if you use that method is remembering similar sounds as:

&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Где=G`day&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;

 Sorry to say this, but this association is wrong. 

What you should remember is 

&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Где= where&quot;.&lt;/strong&gt; 

Nothing more and nothing less. You dont need australians to remember this. You can write and say &quot;Где&quot; three times, then you should have it stored in your memory. And if you really want to make sure that you remember Где you can construct a sentence of your own using that word. You might think this way of learning is old fashioned and boring, but it is working. And it leaves space for more important associations you will have to store in your memory later on. 

Your associations with the word Где later on should be like this:

&lt;strong&gt;-&quot;Где=where&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&quot;when answering to a question containing Где, the 6th case is used&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;-&quot;куда=where to. that is motion towards thus the 4th case is used&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; 


Any australians or &quot;G`days&quot; are only in the way, it is luggage you dont need.


2) My second point of criticism is the alphabetical order of this list. Do you only want to learn the order of letters in the russian alphabet then go ahead, its fine. Do you intend to learn the vocabulary (as i suppose was the intention of this list) then you should forget about alphabetical order and gather words in groups of topics. For example would one topic be titled &quot;saying hello&quot; and would contain Доброе утро (good morning), Добрый день (good afternoon) and Здравствуйте (be greeted).  Your brain is better at storing vocabulary by topic than by alphabet.

I conclude that such an alphabetical list of words is a bad, bad idea when you are aiming at learning a language properly. so, could somebody rename this article and call it something like &quot;a fake-lesson 4&quot; or &quot;funny list of words (not to be taken seriously)&quot;? Please stop people from clogging their brains with australians and G`days.
thank you.

:Alphabetical lists of words are needed when you read or hear a word you don't know, and want to look it up. That's what Russian-English dictionaries are for. I agree that words are best learned in groups; that's why there's a page with all the colors, all the furniture words, etc. Ideally we'll have both subject groups and an alphabetical dictionary for all words.

:Regarding &quot;mental picture&quot; memory association aids, that's how human brains work. We learn things by associating a new item with an item we already know. Native Russians try to teach Russian by associating words, e.g., the word for &quot;stairway&quot; contains the word for &quot;forest&quot; and literally means &quot;forest of stairs.&quot; That works well if you knew the word for &quot;forest.&quot; 3rd- and 4th-year students associate new Russian words with Russian words they already know. But if you're a 1st-year student and don't know the word for &quot;forest,&quot; then thinking of a &quot;forest of stairs&quot; isn't going to help you remember &quot;stairway.&quot; If you know Latin, French, and German (and English) you can associate many Russian words with words you know, because so much of Russian is borrowed from other languages. But if you only know English, then you're left associating Russian words with English words that sound like the Russian words. Sometimes the associations are straightforward, e.g., all Russian houses have big domes like you see on Russian churches, so the word for &quot;house&quot; sounds like &quot;dome.&quot; But other associations are difficult. &quot;Gde&quot; sounds just like an English (actually, Australian) phrase we all know, but the meaning is entirely different.

:Usually you can use the &quot;mental picture&quot; memory aid for a few weeks, and than you know the word and forget the mental picture. This technique is recommended by teachers of many foreign languages (e.g., the book &quot;How To Learn Any Foreign Language&quot; has a chapter about this). And a side benefit is that Russians love to hear Americans' &quot;mental pictures.&quot; You can entertain a Russian friend by explaining that Russians never take their shirts off outdoors so they all have white bellies (&quot;belly&quot; means &quot;white&quot;), etc.--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 18:06, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

== Hm. ==

I see that whoever wrote the page has the annoying habit of some russian books to leave the two dots off of e.( like in the word for actor). This makes the pronounciation misleading. 

Oh, and also, &quot;zdrastvuj&quot;. Is I guess semi-formal. It's not as easy or carefree as &quot;privet&quot;, yet not as formal as &quot;zdravstvujte&quot;. 
[[User:Ladywater|Ladywater]] 06:43, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

== Please mark the stress on those words! ==

Without the stress, I'm forced to look it up for every word, that would take forever!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A guide to getting into the RC airplane hobby. This is a work in progress, please contribute!

Building and flying radio controlled aircraft is a very satisfying hobby to pursue, but can be very complicated for a beginner. If you are serious about it, the best possible path to go down is to join a club and meet some experienced flyers who can help you.
__NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__
=== Clubs ===
If you want to fly anything more than a small electric [[Wikipedia:park flyer|park flyer]], it is almost essential that you join a club. The experienced hobbyists in a club generally extend a warm welcome to beginners, and make great efforts to help them learn about the models and equipment, and how best to install and set them up. They help newcomers avoid disappointment and painful and expensive mistakes. They generally offer first rate flying tuition at no expense beyond that of buying your R/C trainer and joining the club and your national organisation (see below).

Most clubs belong to a national body representing the hobby, so members are covered by insurance and safe flying conditions can be maintained. You can contact the following bodies for information on local clubs. 
 
* USA: [[Wikipedia:Academy of Model Aeronautics|Academy of Model Aeronautics]][http://www.modelaircraft.org/]
* Canada: [[Wikipedia:Model Aeronautics Association of Canada|Model Aeronautics Association of Canada]] [http://www.maac.ca/]
* UK: [[Wikipedia:British Model Flying Association|British Model Flying Association]][http://www.bmfa.org]
* New Zealand: [[Wikipedia:New Zealand Model Aeronautical Association|New Zealand Model Aeronautical Association]] [http://nzmaa.org.nz/apps/main.asp]
* Australia: Model Aeronautical Association of Australia [http://www.maaa.asn.au/]

It's possible to learn to fly R/C planes without a club, but at the very least do find a friend to show you the ropes -- a little time spent in instruction can save hours of frustration. Flight simulators are becoming more and more popular amongst beginners. Those will be explained later in those lines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Meaning==
お ''o-'' is an exalted prefix. It shows respect for the individual or object to whom it pertains.  ご ''go-'' (also written as 御) plays a similar role, being attached to a separate group of words as explained below.

== Translation ==
There is no eqivalent in English. In translation it is either dropped, or (when appropriate) translated as ''your'', etc.

== Usage ==
お ''o-'' can be applied to nouns, na-adjectives, i-adjectives, and verbs.

Because お ''o'' is exalted, it is not used on or about the speaker. For example,

:お{{furi|元気|げんき}}ですか。 ''O-genki desu ka?''

is the formal way of asking &quot;How are you.&quot; The normal response is

:{{furi|元気|げんき}}です。 ''Genki desu.''

In the first example, person A is exalting person B by placing the exalted prefix お ''o-'' in front of the word {{furi|元気|げんき}} ''genki'', which refers to person B's health. In the response, person B omits the お ''o-'' prefix because he does not wish to exalt himself.

Note that お ''o-'' is usually only applied to words of Japanese origin, and most Sino-Japanese words take the honorific prefix {{furi|御|ご}} ''go-'' instead, as in {{furi|御主人|ごしゅじん}} ''master/husband''. ({{furi|元気|げんき}} ''genki'' is a notable exception.)

== Examples ==
Words that commonly use お ''o-'' or {{furi|御|ご}} ''go-'' include:

=== Nouns ===
*お{{furi|茶|ちゃ}} ''o-cha'' &quot;tea&quot;
*お{{furi|水|みず}} ''o-mizu'' &quot;water&quot;
*お{{furi|仕事|しごと}} ''o-shigoto'' &quot;job&quot;
*お{{furi|家|うち}} ''o-uchi'' &quot;home&quot;
*お{{furi|部屋|へや}} ''o-heya'' &quot;room&quot;
*お{{furi|父|とう}}さん ''otousan'' &quot;father&quot;
*お{{furi|母|かあ}}さん ''okaasan'' &quot;mother&quot;
*お{{furi|兄|にい}}さん ''oniisan'' &quot;older brother&quot;
*お{{furi|姉|ねえ}}さん ''oneesan'' &quot;older sister&quot;
*お{{furi|祖父|じい}}さん ''ojiisan'' &quot;grandfather&quot;
*お{{furi|祖母|ばあ}}さん ''obaasan'' &quot;grandmother&quot;
*お{{furi|子|こ}}さん ''o-ko-san'' &quot;child&quot;
*ご{{furi|主人|しゅじん}} ''go-shujin'' &quot;master/husband (of the person who is spoken to)&quot;
*ご{{furi|飯|はん}} ''go-han'' &quot;meal or (cooked) rice&quot;

=== Na-Adjectives ===

= Open Sicilian with 2...Nc6 =
Here White is moving a piece that is already developed, so he is playing an opening move that does not help his development.  He is capturing a pawn, however it is anticipated that Black can capture Whites pawn when White played 3.d4.  In return for neglecting development White is getting a centrally located knight, and Black neglected development when he made two moves with the same pawn.

A good point here is it is bad for Black to trade knights on d4, and it also bad for White to trade knights on c6.  If Black plays 4. ... Nxd4 followed by 5. Qxd4 White will have better control of the center and Black cannot easily chase away the White queen because the Knight that was on b8 has been traded.  Also if White plays 5.Nxc6 then black can play 5. ...bxc6 which will strengthen Blacks center and prepares for the d7-d5 push.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Selecting the proper plane for a budget, experience and purpose can be key to enjoying the hobby. If you get the wrong thing, you will only end up with frustration and disappointment.

== Construction ==
=== Ready to fly ===
Ready to fly (RTF) models are popular amongst [[Wikipedia:park fliers|park fliers]]. They come ready made, with all the electronics and radio equipment installed for you. All that needs to be done is charge up the batteries. Whilst they can be useful for learning the basics of how to fly, they can quickly become boring to the pilot as his/her skill progresses. 

However, is worth watching out for cheap, mass produced, poorly constructed models.

=== Almost ready to fly ===
Almost ready to fly (ARTF) models have become very popular, especially for trainers. These come mostly built, and it is only a matter of assembling the major components (i.e. joining and attaching the wings and tail surfaces to the fuselage) and installing your radio equipment and engine.

=== Kit ===

Kits vary enormously in the demands that they make of the builder. Some require considerable expertise and investment of time, while others (like the recent breed of interlocking laser-cut kits) can be assembled as quickly as a simple jigsaw puzzle. The choice of materials is almost unlimited. Traditionally, kits mainly used balsa and a few plywood parts. Polystyrene foam then became common, as did countless combinations of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP), expanded polypropylene (EPP), carbon fibre and other modern materials.

The assembly of kits requires an extensive range of adhesives, with cyanoacrylate being popular, as well as two-part epoxy, PVA and others.

=== Plan ===

Any type of model can be built from a plan. Plans can be highly detailed or basic in the extreme, requiring all different levels of experience. It is common for RC airplane magazines to include 'free' plans as a selling point, often on a monthly basis. Most larger publications in the hobby also maintain back catalogues of plans, which can be ordered by those who wish to build from them, or refer to them. Many plans are also available for free online, though quality is extremely variable. Hobbyists must also be aware that a significant number of plans available for download have been scanned and made available in breach of copyright.

===SPAD===
A relatively recent developement, [[RC_Airplane/SPAD|SPAD]] stands for Simple Plastic Airplane Design. Whilst it is primarily a method of model airplane construction, SPAD is more of a design philosophy that goes like this:

'''&quot;Spad is the simple concept of offering free plans and ideas for designing very cheap, great flying airplanes made from Coroplast, gutterpipe, aluminum, or anything else we can find that works! The Spad concept is also the world wide sharing of these ideas and most of all, having fun with our hobby!&quot;'''

This is a quote from [http://www.spadtothebone.com spadtothebone] a vast resource of plans and information on spads.

SPAD is a reversal of the trend towards better looking, very complex and very delicate models. SPADs are often extremely ugly, built out of materials such as waste plastic, PVC downpipe, correx (or coroplast in the USA - more on this later) or aluminium channel. Although they may not look beautiful, they can be made to fly extremely well, and are unbelievably tough.

== Type ==
===Electric or Glow (gas)===
Years ago gas airplanes were the norm.  Most fields which fly gas airplanes require membership and registration with the AMA.  However, recently with the advent of LiPo batteries and brushless motors, electric parkflyers are becoming common place.  Electric parkflyers can often be flown in local parks or fields and often are less expensive than a gas plane.   When it comes to very large scale airplanes, gas is far more prevalent.

=== Powered flight ===
A simple, high winged trainer is the best thing to get if you are new to the hobby. ARTFs are very popular, since your trainer will probably suffer the odd bump.

=== Gliders ===
A large rudder/elevator soarer or simple aileron trainer are the best things to get. Almost indestructable expanded [[Wikipedia:polypropylene|polypropylene]] (EPP) models have become very popular for learning.

===Flying Wings===
Flying wings (often referred to as Delta Wings due to their triangular shape) are generally more for experienced pilot who enjoy high speed flying.  These airplanes are capable of very high speeds and are usually are more controllable in windy conditions.  The motor is often a rear mounted (some gas models have a front propeller) high rpm motor which turns a relatively smaller propeller.  Most of these have no landing gear and require special channel mixing of the ailerons/elevator.

===Warbirds===
This is the common term referring to WWII era aircraft.  Most Warbirds are for experienced pilots who like scale detail.  These planes are often quite fast and execute most aerobatic maneuvers gracefully.

===3D===
Very light, highly maneuverable aerobatic airplanes.  These planes perform aerobatic maneuvers and flight patterns at minimal speeds.  Some of these are even flown inside gymnasiums!  Often made of flat, uncontoured Styrofoam these planes usually offer little or no scale detail.  These are usually for experienced modelers, however the ParkZone Typhoon 3D and the Great Planes U-can-Do 3D offer intermediate pilots an entry level start into 3D.

== Size ==
If you have joined a club and have tuition, a larger trainer is probably the best solution. They will be easier to see and fly slower, making learning that much easier. However, they will be more expensive and will guzzle more fuel or batteries.

If you do not wish to join a club, do not get a large plane. Large planes can be extremely dangerous! You are probably best off getting something similar to a [[Wikipedia:park flyer|park flyer]]. If your interest is sufficiently captured, you may well find your attitude to organized flying changes.

Other things to consider:
* Will it fit in your car?
* Do you have enough space to build it in?
* Electric or gas?

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many electronic parts in modern RC systems. Although much simpler and cheaper than older equipment, it can be very confusing for a beginner.

== Electronic components ==
Whether an RC plane is gas or electric powered or a glider, there are some common electrical components that are required to control them.

=== All planes ===
* A [[Wikipedia:transmitter|transmitter]] (also called a radio or controller) is a handheld device with joysticks, switches and an antenna that communicates with the receiver in your plane, allowing you to control it.
* A [[Wikipedia:receiver|receiver]] receives the signal from the transmitter and translates this into positions for servos and electronic speed controllers.
* [[Wikipedia:Servos|Servos]] control the position of control surfaces and other things (such as throttle).

=== Gas powered and gliders ===
* A [[Wikipedia:battery|battery]] (normally [[Wikipedia:NiCad|NiCad]] or [[Wikipedia:NiMH|NiMH]]) to operate servos and receiver.

=== Electric powered ===
* A battery (normally NiCad, NiMH or [[Wikipedia:LiPo|LiPo]]) to operate servos, receiver and motor.
* An ESC ([[Wikipedia:electronic speed controller|electronic speed controller]]) for controlling the speed of the electric motor.

=== A More Detailed Explanation of Components===

'''Transmitter''' 

The Transmitter is the most visible part of the system - anyone who has seen a radio control model being flown or operated is familiar with the rectangular box with an antenna protruding from the top and the left and right control sticks or joysticks. Costs for transmitters and receiver sets start from as low as US $ 25 right up to hundreds of dollars for the more sophisticated models. 

'''Receiver'''

The Receiver is a small electronic unit that is capable of receiving the signals given by the transmitter. The receiver will only act on signals sent to it by its transmitter, most modern systems are capable of being operated with many other systems in the same flying area without interfering with one another. 

A search for &quot;RC receiver&quot; in a search engine will yield information and photos of RC receivers. An RC hobby store will usually display a wide variety of receivers as well as transmitters and other components.

The receiver will have out put terminals for sending the signals received to the servos -these are electronic components that convert the current sent by the receiver to an movement - to move a rudder, aileron or an elevator. A point to note is unlike the earlier systems or simpler toy RC systems, the current sent out by the receiver is proportional to the movement of the control sticks on the transmitter so finer control can be exercised, not simply 'all or nothing ' control of an elevator or other control surface. To use the example of a radio controlled toy car, where the front wheels can be steered full left or full right or straight ahead, proportional controls enable the wheels to be steered in degrees, either a small correction or a full turn to the left or right and anything in between.

'''Servos'''

A servo is a device for moving a part of the model. Usually servos operate the rudder and elevator on a three chanel model and the aileron as well on a four chanel model. The throttle may be operated by a servo or on electric models it may be operated by a speed controller called an 'electronic speed controller' that plugs into the receiver.it connect the control rods

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most powered model-aircraft, including electric, internal-combustion, and rubber-band powered models, generate thrust by spinning an airscrew.   The ''propeller'' is a type of airscrew and is by far the most commonly used device.  The blades of the rotating propeller push against the atmosphere, and by [[Wikipedia:Newton's Third Law|Newton's Third Law]], the air's reactionary force pushes the aircraft.

As in full-size planes, the propeller's dimensions and placement (along the fuselage or wings) are factored into the design.  In general, a large diameter and low-pitch offers greater thrust at low airspeed, while a small diameter and higher-pitch sacrifices thrust for a higher maximum-airspeed.  In RC aircraft, the builder can choose from a wide selection of propellers, to tailor the plane's airborne characteristics.  A mismatched propeller will compromise the aircraft's airworthiness, and if too heavy, inflict undue mechanical wear on the powerplant. Scale RC aircraft propellers are usually specified as ''diameter × pitch'', given in inches. For example, a 5x3 propeller has a diameter of 5 inches, and a pitch of 3 inches. The pitch is the distance that the propeller would advance if turned through one revolution in a solid medium. Additional parameters are the number of blades (2 and 3 are the most common).

There are two different methods to transfer rotational-energy from the powerplant to the propeller.  
* With the ''direct-drive'' method, the propeller is attached directly on the engine's spinning crankshaft (or motor-rotor.)  This arrangement is optimum when the propeller and powerplant share overlapping regions of best efficiency (measured in RPM.)

* With the ''reduction'' method, the crankshaft drives a simple transmission, which is usually a simple gearbox containing a pinion and spur gear.  The transmission decreases the output RPM by the gear ratio (thereby also increasing output torque by approximately the same ratio). Reduction-drive is common on larger aircraft and aircraft with disproportionately large propellers. On such powerplant arrangements, the transmission serves to match the powerplant's and propeller's optimum operating RPM. Geared propellers were once used very commonly on electric motors, but with the advent of brushless motors are rarely seen. 

In some designs of aircraft, the propeller is replaced by a ''ducted fan'' unit. In jet-powered or ducted fan scale aircraft, the engine is a single-piece assembly with no user-changeable parts.  The turbine-wheel spins at extremely high speed (&gt;150,000 RPM), limiting most adjustments to the original factory.

[[Wikipedia:Ornithopter|Ornithopter]]s are aircraft that may have a similar physical shape to a plane, but do not use airscrews at all.  In ornithopters, the reciprocating-motion of the wing structure imitates the flapping-wings of living birds, producing both thrust and lift.

== Propeller selection ==
Differences in propellers can drastically change flight characteristics, even if nothing else on the craft changes. Changes in pitch or length can adjust thrust but will also adjust the amount of strain on the powerplant. A prop with more blades creates more thrust if the prop turns at the same speed.

Some tips for propeller selection:
* If a plane's cowl is low to the ground during takeoff or landing (short or no landing gear), a shorter prop with more blades can replace a longer prop and provide equal thrust.
* The more air the prop moves, the more thrust is provided. A prop with a steeper pitch and/or wider blade will displace more air at the same speed. The more air displaced in each rotation, the more responsive the craft is in regard to its relative weight. 3D flyers require more air displacement in order to support the weight of the craft. A narrow prop with high pitch that may be used for racing can displace a lot of air at high RPMs but may not create enough displacement per rotation to be used for a higher drag bi-plane of the same wingspan.
* If a prop is too long and/or too heavy, it can create a gyro effect which will counteract yaw and pitch and make the craft less responsive. A little gyro effect can be beneficial for stability, so this needs to be determined on a craft by craft basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Control surfaces are movable surfaces that control the airplane. These are connected to servos with linkages. Getting these made carefully and accurately is essential to the success of your model.

== Types of control surface ==

* [[Wikipedia:Aileron|Aileron]] - on the wings controlling roll.
* [[Wikipedia:Elevator_(aircraft)|Elevator]] - on the horizontal tail controlling pitch (up and down).
* [[Wikipedia:Rudder|Rudder]] - on the vertical tail controlling yaw (left and right).
* [[Wikipedia:Flaps_(aircraft)|Flaps]] - on the wing, but change the wing [[Wikipedia:camber|camber]] to increase lift (and drag) for landing.
* [[Wikipedia:Canard|Canard]] - a horizontal surface at the front of the plane that controls pitch. Much less common than elevators, but does the same thing.

Some of them are assigned multiple names depending on how they are used.

*[[Wikipedia:Flaperon|Flaperon]] - combined ailerons and flaps.
*[[Wikipedia:Elevon|Elevon]] - combined elevator and ailerons (as used on [[Wikipedia:deltas|deltas]] and [[Wikipedia:flying wings|flying wings]]).
*[[Wikipedia:Ailevator|Ailevator]] - moving separate elevators (in a similar way to elevons) combined with normal ailerons.
*[[Wikipedia:Ruddervator|Ruddervator]] - combined rudder and elevator (as used on a V-tail).

== Construction ==
Control surfaces for RC planes can be made from many different materials such as balsa wood, plywood, foam, corrugated plastic and sheet plastic. The structures should be strong and lightweight and have at least a portion of the surface that is solid so that a control horn can be attached.

== Hinging and movement ==
Control surface hinges can be made out of various materials. Larger planes use traditional style hinges made from combinations of nylon, metal, fiberglass and plastic. Very small or lightweight planes will often use nothing more than clear plastic tape (packing tape) that is stuck to both the control surface and the frame. This requires that the opposite side of the joining control surface edge be angled to allow movement in both directions. Midsized planes use smaller hinges similar to the ones use on larger planes, or will utilize CA hinges (flexible sheet plastic covered on both sides with meshy [[Wikipedia:cyanoacrylate|cyanoacrylate]] material to allow for glue [[Wikipedia:wicking|wicking]]) that are simply inserted and glued into small slits in the joining edges.

== Servo configuration ==
Because of the available space in larger planes in the wings and fuselage, servos are usually placed as close to the control surface as possible, which results in much better accuracy. It does not require much or any routing of control rods or lines through the fuselage.

Usually, lack of internal space in smaller planes often requires servos to be mounted in the main cavity or on the outside of the fuselage, requiring longer control rods and the necessity to route them through the covering of the plane, in some fashion. It is sometimes necessary to put servos as near the [[Wikipedia:centre of gravity|centre of gravity]] (C of G) as possible to balance the model correctly.

== Control linkages and mechanics ==
Control linkages consist of levers, joints and other moving parts that allow a servo to move a control surface. There are hundreds of available options ranging from various materials, to different sizes and weights, depending on what is needed for operation and flight requirements. For a hobbyist building from scratch or from a kit, proper selection and assembly of these mechanical components can be a great challenge rewarding.

If you have bought an ARTF (almost ready to fly) model, it will be likely that control linkages are included with the kit. Be careful though, the linkages included with many ARTFs are terrible plastic moulded jobs, which have a tendency to pop open or break in flight! If need be, it might be worth browsing the shelves of your local model shop to find some better quality linkages.

=== Control arms and horns ===
Control arms are a type of lever attachment on a servo [[Wikipedia:crankshaft|crankshaft]]. The attachment may have one or more arms to allow for multiple positions and control rods. Some attachments that have multiple positions are circular. It's the control arm that transfers leverage from the servo to the control rod.

A control horn is on the receiving end of the servo leverage, either being pushed or pulled. The control horn is simply a lever that is mounted onto a control surface, perpendicular to the edge of the control surface, that connects to the end of the control rod allowing the surface to pivot on a hinge point.

=== Control rods ===
Control rods or wires can be made from various material such as plastic, metal, carbon fiber and fiberglass. What is used is often determined by the size and desired weight of the plane, what is being controlled (aileron, retracts), and the appropriate linkage types. Control rods are often attached to the control horns and other levers by [[Wikipedia:clevis|clevis]]es, [[Wikipedia:ball joint|ball joint]]s, or other specialized adapters. Small craft and park flyers often use a simple z-bend (bend in the wire the shape of a &quot;Z&quot;, all angles being 90 degrees) to attach to a control horn.

=== Assembly ===
Larger RC airplanes allow for a wide variety of options, materials and techniques when assembling control linkages. The larger and thicker control surfaces, potential flight weight and fuselage cavity size make it possible to not only choose from very strong, easy to work with materials, but they can also be obscured from sight with ease. 

It is common on these larger planes, since more torque is required and faster speeds are reached to have control rods made from aluminum, carbon fiber or fiberglass. Linkages are often made by soldering, [[clevis]]es, ball joints, or some combination thereof. Control horns are usually bolted straight through the control surface provided strength and durability. Larger planes will often have retractable landing gear connected to one or more servos using the same kinds of linkages and components.

Small planes and park flyers often have more restrictions. Materials must be lightweight (plastic, thin wire or cable, aluminum, fiberglass) and as small as possible. Small tube wire guides are often used to encase the flexible wire or cable to its control surface destination. There are many available fuselage opening components to allow the rods to neatly penetrate the covering and some can be made from household materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is crucial for the plane to have a covering of some type in order to be able to fly, however, other visual details are simply for fun and for the joy and pride involved in the hobby.

Many hobbyists will not bother going beyond the basic covering required to fly the plane, for certain crafts. This is often because of the additional effort involved does not balance with the likelihood that the place will probably crash at some point and need repair. Very detailed exteriors are usually reserved for more experienced flyers and planes that are large enough to support the weight of all the extra trimmings, details, cockpit, paint and other non-crucial additions.

== Covering ==

== Tissue and dope ==
The oldest, and most common method of covering a model is to use tissue and a cellulose thinner to stiffen the tissue and make it waterproof. The tissue is usually shrunk using a light spray of water. The cellulose thinner 'dope' is then applied after the water dries. providing a drum-tight, stiff and light covering material. The tension of the material strengthens the structure.

== Sheet Balsa ==
Sometimes a model is covered with sheet balsa and either painted or covered again with a covering film.

== Foam Models ==
Foam models require no covering, and are sometimes painted with acrylic paints, and decorated with decals.

== Iron On coverings ==
Most iron- on or glue - on coverings, or skins, will come with application instructions, although various experts have published works on how to master certain covering types, the most common being the plastic heat-shrink film. When done properly and with skill, it can give the most professional and authentic look, depending on what type of plane it is, as some full scale planes were originally covered in cloth other other materials.

== Painting ==

One popular method of painting is to use the common model paints that are used for plastic model kits. A good spraying system is recommended for to save weight.

== Applying decals ==

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]

Decals can be purchased from hobby shops in various sizes. Alternatively modelers can create their own decals and transfer them to the model by printing on sticker paper. With the advent of affordable color printers this had become within the reach of almost every modeller.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">(Introduction)


== Techniques ==
=== Sanding ===
If a plane is properly put together, improper sanding of exterior surfaces will not affect flight much. However, it will greatly affect how sleek and refined the craft looks at completion. It is crucial to sand joining surfaces that will be adhered for a better bond, but superficial sanding can be done to any degree of desired perfection.

It helps to have adequate sanding tools and materials. For large surfaces, a large block sander is helpful to ensure that surfaces are flat and consistent. Often a hand [[planer]] help start off with a smooth surface. Small curves surfaces can be sanded with various hand or automatic tools, but a skilled hobbyist can often achieve the same or better results with just a piece of sandpaper. Glue joints should be smoothed out to prevent roughness showing through the plane's skin. Larger spurs or glue deposits can also be removed carefully with a hobby knife. Inspecting the plane from many angles and striving for symmetry, smoothness and consistency yields the best results.

== Alignment and measurements ==
Each structural component of an RC plane is usually built separately, then assemble toward the end of construction. The final assembly of these structural parts is an extremely crucial step in making a flyable craft. A slant in the vertical stabilizer and [[Wiktionary:rudder#Noun|rudder]] will make the craft turn more sharply to one side than the other. If the trailing edge of the wings are lower than expected, the plane will have more drag in normal flight and will stall more easily. If right and left wings are not mounted symmetrically, various things could occur, including: unwanted [[Wiktionary:roll#Noun|roll]], drag to one side, turns too sharply on one side due to steep dihedral, etc... The side affects of improperly mounted components are numerous.

A hobbyist must use proper tools and patience when mounting components. Clamps, pins, tape, and even a very small drop of glue can aid in positioning parts before final adhesives are applied. Incidence meters, rulers, tape measures, [[Wiktionary:level#Noun|level]]s, contractors triangles, protractors and just plain visual detection are important tools in finding structural nuances and imperfections. Components should be inspected and measured from all possible angles before final adhering.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before attempting to fly, it is highly advisable to:

* Have the model checked (and test flown) by an experienced pilot. It's hard enough to learn to fly a well set-up plane, but there are many simple mistakes that can make it much harder. RTF (ready to fly) planes attempt to address this but building and set-up skills greatly improve the satisfaction and enjoyment available from the hobby. If you join a club, this help is much easier to find.
* Ensure that your field is large enough. This depends on your model but a football field is a good size for a park flyer.
* Pick a calm day. Wind will make it much harder to control (especially for a small park flyer) and greatly increase the chance of an accident happening.
* If you are flying outside a club, ensure you are not within a couple of mile or so of an existing club as your radio could well interfere with them and cause accidents. Likewise, their radios could cause interference with your model.
* Ensure your field is empty. Dogs will chase your plane and other people may consider your plane more dangerous than you do.

Let's say that we have the following block diagram:
 
[[Image:Discrete Time Block.svg|center|400px]]

''h[n]'' is known as the '''Impulse Response'' of the digital system. We will talk about impulse responses here in this chapter.

== Impulse Function ==

In digital circuits, we use a variant of the continuous-time delta function. This delta function (&amp;delta;''[n]'') has a value of 1 at ''n = 0'', and a value of 0 everywhere else. 

 &amp;delta;[n] = [... 0 0 0 0 1&amp; 0 0 0 0 ...]  

If we set ''x[n] ='' &amp;delta;''[n]'', then the output ''y[n]'' will be the response of the system to an impulse, or simply, the &quot;Impulse Response&quot;.

We can time-shift the impulse function as such:

 &amp;delta;[n-1] = [... 0 0 0 0&amp; 1 0  0 0 0 ...]
 &amp;delta;[n+1] = [... 0 0 0 0  1 0&amp; 0 0 0 ...]

We can add time-shifted values of the impulse function to create an '''Impulse Train:'''

 y[n] = &amp;delta;[n] + &amp;delta;[n-1] + &amp;delta;[n-2] + &amp;delta;[n-4]
 y[n] = [1&amp; 1 1 0 1]

== Impulse Trains ==

== Impulse Response ==

If we have a difference equation relating ''y[n]'' to ''x[n]'', we can find the impulse response difference equation by replacing every ''y'' with an ''h'', and every ''x'' with a &amp;delta;:

 y[n] = 2x[n] + 3x[n-1] + 4x[n-2]
 h[n] = 2&amp;delta;[n] + 3&amp;delta;[n-1] + 4&amp;delta;[n-2]

And by plugging in successive values for ''n'', we can calculate the impulse response to be:

 h[n] = [2&amp; 3 4]

== Output ==

Now, let's say that we have a given impulse response, ''h[n]'', and we have a given input ''x[n]'' as such:

 x[n] = [1&amp; 0 1 2]
 h[n] = [2&amp; 2 2 1]

We can calculate the output, ''y[n]'', as the convolution of those 2 quantities:

 x[n]    -&gt;       1&amp; 0 1 2
 h[-n]   -&gt;       1  2 2 2&amp;
 h[-n-3] -&gt; 1 2 2 2&amp;               -&gt; y[m-3] = 2&amp;
 h[-n-2] -&gt;   1 2 2  2&amp;            -&gt; y[m-2] = 2
 h[-n-1] -&gt;     1 2  2 2&amp;          -&gt; y[m-1] = 4
 h[-n]   -&gt;       1  2 2 2&amp;        -&gt; y[m]   = 7
 h[-n+1] -&gt;          1 2 2 2&amp;      -&gt; y[m+1] = 6
 h[-n+2] -&gt;            1 2 2 2&amp;    -&gt; y[m+2] = 5
 h[-n+3] -&gt;              1 2 2 2&amp;  -&gt; y[m+3] = 2
 
 y[n] = [2&amp; 2 4 7 6 5 2]</text>

Political Economists are concerned with the allocation of scarce resources in a world of infinite wants and needs. In order to allocate these resources, politics are used within a state to provide for the people. Political economy is the study of the relationships between individuals and society, and more specifically, the relationships between citizens and states.

Political economy is a study of philosophy and ideology that studies the evolution of political and economic ideas. Political economy is a mixture of politics, economics, sociology, philosophy, and history, which all bring together evidence to the study of how humans exist within societies. Political economists study political ideology, economic structure, human interaction, human nature, and theories in philosophical thought. It is a study that studies not only the mechanics of a particular structure, but also the reasoning behind why a structure is regarded to be the best by various people with different beliefs.

The study of political economics can be split into two different sections, one which is [[Political Economy/Classical Political Economy|Classical Political Economy]] and the other which is [[Political Economy/Modern Political Economy|Modern Political Economy]]. The classical branch studies range from the conservative philosophers such as Machiavelli to liberals such as Adam Smith to the critiquers of liberalism such as Marx. The modern branch studies range from social liberals such as Keynes to modern political economists whose works deal with a multitude of issues including foreign trade and globalization.

* Note: The structure of the topics covered in this book is inspired by the lectures of Alan Karras and Dariush Zahedi, both professors at University of California, Berkeley. 

==How To Use This Book==
The book is split into three sections; General, Classical Political Economy, and Modern Political Economy. The General chapter covers both classical and modern political economics and is a general reference guide for those who want a brief overview of the study of political economics. The two other chapters go into more detail of the material covered in the General chapter. They focus on pre-Enlightenment philosophy to Marx, and Keynes onward, respectively. Make sure you understand the three general ideologies of political economics before studying further. Always refer back to this page in order to review the theories in order to gain a better understanding of the arguments of each one. It can be rather cumbersome and awkward to study a large amount of detailed arguments and facts without a short, coherent summary of the most important points. Therefore, learn the fundamental basics of the three theories of political economy first, and then try to understand how the theorists tried to justify these views by either assumptions, arguments, or facts.

There may be some terms that you are unfamiliar with. In that case, go to Wikipedia and learn the terms first because they are used in a technical manner in this book. Although you might have a casual understanding of some of the terms, it is important that you study them carefully in order to differentiate between subtle arguments.

Right under many section headings are links to articles in Wikipedia. You are expected to study the article along with the section that follows. This will help you study better because the sections are written with the assumption that you have understood to some degree the facts in Wikipedia. The sections are generally arguments of theorists and you will need background information from Wikipedia in order to understand the facts and assumptions used in the rationalizations of these theories. In other words, the study of political economy requires you to have a basic knowledge of world history. The links will take you to the short articles of the history topic in question which will give you a context to understanding where the different theories of political economy come from.

For those of you who have a fair understanding of the three main political economic ideologies, you may strengthen your knowledge by contributing to the book. Do not hesitate to contact other editors to help you, and if you like, you can add the theories of various philosophers that are not currently covered in the book. One way of making sure you understand the material is by being able to explain it coherently to those who have not studied the material before.

Try to learn something from this book, and if nothing else, have fun reading it.

==Theory==
Modern political economists categorize theories under three general ideologies:
* [[Wikipedia:Liberalism|Liberalism]]: Wealth comes from ingenuity, labor and exchange. It is the result of the use of land and other natural resources, along with capital in the form of durable goods and labor.
** Everyone can benefit from economics. Economics is regarded to be not a zero sum game, but one that is continually progressing with rising standards.
** Individuals are unimportant, but the good of the community at large is the criterion for decision-making.
** Individuals are generally virtuous even when given a fair amount of political and economic liberties.
** Everyone can win, when the conditions are fair and favorable.
** The accumulation of private property is good for society.
** Equality of opportunity is important, inequality of possessions is less so.
** The state supports the structure of civil society.
** Therefore, the state should let individuals have freedom with the licence of not causing harm to others.
* [[Wikipedia:Marxism|Marxism]]: Wealth comes from manual labor and exchange, not ingenuity and all individuals should benefit from economics. Inequality is inherently bad. Economics is regarded to be a zero sum game.
** Profit in capitalism comes from surplus labor extracted from the worker.  The worker must be producing more than he is paid by his employer, thus the surplus of his labor is stolen from him.
** The private ownership of the means of production and wage labor will inherently breed inequality and leave some in society with immense wealth and many mired in poverty.  The means of production should thus be collectively controlled.
** Inequality is bad.
** The modern capitalist state contradicts the needs of the majority of civil society and favors an elite.
** Therefore, the state, or some other worker-controlled vechile should mediate the distribution of wealth until the state is no longer needed.
* [[Wikipedia:Mercantilism|Economic Nationalism]]: Wealth comes from the use of power, and the use of power facilitates the accumulation of wealth. Individuals should work to benefit the wealth and power of the state. Economics is regarded to be a zero sum game.
** The state is important.
** Individuals are generally not virtuous. Instead, they are ignorant and confused, and cannot form a cohesive society without a strong state.
** Not everyone can win.
** The state's accumulation of public property is better for the society than the individual accumulation of private property is.
** Inequality is a reality and sometimes important and necessary.
** The state controls, permeates, and becomes one with the civil society.
** Therefore, everything should be done to benefit the state.
* Note: A zero sum game is a term for the idea that when one individual gains wealth, another individual must lose that same amount. In other words, there is a fixed amount of wealth that circulates in the world, and wealth cannot be created or destroyed, but can move.

The contents of this book will cover these topics in greater detail, and you will learn how and why political economists have come up with different solutions to the question of how wealth and power are to be distributed among individuals and states.[ew]

==A Word About Theories==
Social science theories are just what they are: theories. The philosophers who have come up with these theories believe in them because they have made a set of assumptions by their observations and they have made conclusions based on these assumptions. However, as the reality of the world is open to interpretation, each theory describes the world in its own unique way. No theories are wrong if they are supportable by facts and observations. These theories you will learn are just ways that thinkers have used to describe the world around them. Just remember that you do not have to agree with a particular theory, but you must be able to understand all theories in order to make a conclusion about the world in which you live.

The best way to understand a particular ideology is to think as a philosopher would think. How would believers of a particular theory present a solution to a particular problem? Thinkers in different schools of thought will come up with different answers because of the differences in their assumptions. Make sure you understand how different theorists think.

Most importantly, understand that these theories are constantly being altered, borrowed from, and in some cases, discredited completely. Theories are not rules to the world but rather ways to look at the world. A person can look at the world in different perspectives and can combine different assumptions of theories to describe it. No matter how different theories can be, they can almost always be combined because they are almost never mutually exclusive.

All of this makes the theories appear to be unimportant in the real world of political economics, but this is not true. However, there is a problem with theories which causes them to be treated this way. Either they deal with a fraction of the full macroeconomy, in which case the assumption that all other aspects are not changing is unacceptable. 

This alternative is to use a full theory that is able to simulate the behavior of the complete macroeconomy as a system. The results of this are usually so complicated that it is difficult to properly understand what is going on and where the forecast is leading. Never-the-less, such analysis should be able to tell governments what particular policies would do and to assist them in making the best decisions from the viewpoint of the community at large. 

The answer to this is to start with a fully comprehensive yet simplified theory which deals with only the most basic yet significant parts of the system. This subject is not one where much research has been done although the writer below has in fact achieved a useful result. To see this kindly communicate with David Chester, chesterdh@hotmail.com

== Systems Introduction ==

Digital systems can be conceptually very difficult to understand at first. Let's start out with a block diagram:

[[Image:Discrete Time Block.svg|400px|center]]

We have a digital system, ''h[n]'', that is going to alter the input (''x[n]'') in some way, and produce an output (''y[n]''). At each integer value for discrete time, ''n'', we will feed 1 value of ''x[n]'' into the machine, turn the crank, and create 1 output value for ''y[n]''.

== Basic Example ==

Let's say that ''h[n]'' is a multiplier circuit with a value of 5. Every input value is multiplied by 5, and that is the output. In other words, we can show our difference calculus equation as such:

:&lt;math&gt;y\left[n\right] = 5 x\left[n\right]&lt;/math&gt;

now, for each successive value for ''n'', we can calculate our output value, ''y[n]''. As an example, using the above difference equation, we can feed in an experimental input:

 x[n] = [1 0 1 2]

And by multiplying each data item by 5, we get the following result:

 y[n] = [5 0 5 10]

==Properties of Digital systems==

A loose definition of a causal system is a system in which the output does not change before the input. All real systems are causal, and it is impossible to create a system that is not causal.

== Circuit Symbols ==

*wires
*pickoff nodes
*adders
*multipliers

== Physically Realizeable Systems ==

There is a distinction to be made between systems which are possible mathematically, and systems that can be physically implemented in digital hardware. Some systems might look good on paper, but they are difficult, if not impossible, to actually build. One criteria we have already seen is that a physically realizable digital system must not rely on future values, only on past values. We will discuss other criteria in future chapters, as the concepts involved become more familiar.</text>

Digital Signal Processing is a field of study that is a combination of both mathematical theory, and physical implementation. It makes no sense to consider a digital system without first asking &quot;can this be constructed physically?&quot; MATLAB is an excellent (although expensive) tool for simulating systems, and for creating the ever-valuable &quot;proof of concept&quot;. This book will make several references to MATLAB, but don't get confused: This book will not teach how to program in MATLAB. If you would like to learn MATLAB, check out the book [[Programming:MATLAB]].

Alternately, enterprising students might attempt to use [[w:en:GNU_Octave|GNU Octave]], which is a free [[w:en:Free_Software|Open Source]] alternative to MATLAB. Octave can be obtained from http://www.octave.org . It endeavors to be MATLAB-compatible and largely it is (a lot of MATLAB code can be run using Octave, and vice versa), though some functionality is missing. For more information on Octave, see the Wikibook [[Octave Programming]]. (There are other free alternatives to MATLAB, with varying degrees of code compatibility.)</text>

This book was written at Wikibooks, a free online community where people write open-content textbooks. Any person with internet access is welcome to participate in the creation and improvement of this book. Because this book is continuously evolving, there are no finite &quot;versions&quot; or &quot;editions&quot; of this book. Permanent links to known good versions of the pages may be provided.

== Introduction ==

Statics is the branch of mechanics concerned with the study of forces and the effect of forces on a non-deformable, or rigid, system when the system is in a state of equilibrium. 

This course is a crucial prerequisite for later areas, such as Dynamics and Properties of Materials.  It utilizes principles of physics and calculus. It is fundamental in many different branches of engineering, from mechanical to civil engineering, and the principles of equilibrium, moment of inertia, and center of gravity will be revisited in more advanced fields. It is because an understanding of these topics is so crucial that statics does not cover a wide range of topics. Every problem will deal with some combination of two equations: the net forces being equal to zero, and/or net moments being equal to zero. 


[[Image:Statics1.jpeg|center|thumb|400px|Statics in the taxonomy of physical sciences.]]

==Who is This Book For?==
This book is for undergraduate students pursuing, or thinking about pursuing, a degree in engineering. As specified early, statics is needed in almost every field of engineering. It is not an introductory course, however. Statics does not attempt to reinvent the wheel, and is built firmly on the foundation of Physics. Newton's Laws are essential to statics. Mathematically, one should have a firm grip on vector algebra, though it is possible to solve many simple problems without the use of vectors. While it would benefit a student to understand calculus concepts, like the ability to calculate an area or a volume, most statics problems will involve simple geometries. 

==How is this book organized==
This book is organized to introduce concepts that will be later used in Dynamics and Properties of Materials. As such, it will begin by reviewing over vector mathematics and then introducing simple concepts, like Newton's Second Law, and then increasing the ways with which those concepts work together. Mathematically, this will involve increasing the number of forces, increasing the number of dimensions, and then expanding [[Statics/Particle Equilibrium|particle equilibrium]] to [[Statics/Rigid Body Equilibrium (contents)|Rigid Body Equilibrium]] and [[Statics/Structural Analysis|Structural Equilibrium]]. 

Finally, we will go over Moments of Inertia and Center of Mass. These concepts will be critical in higher level disciplines and a firm understanding will allow you to analyze more complex problems when the concepts of stress, strain, and acceleration are introduced.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Phatmonkey. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Phatmonkey~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Physical Examination ==

Physical examination of the cardiac patient, and the cardiac surgical patient, should include thorough evaluations of the cardiac, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems. For the latter two processes, please consult the respective WikiBooks, Wikipedia pages, and medical texts.

=== THE CARDIOVASCULAR PHYSICAL EXAM ===

The cardiovascular physical exam consists, generally, of indirect arterial blood pressure measurement (in both arms and in at least one lower extremity), evaluation of central and peripheral arterial pulses, inspection of the patient, palpation of the precordium, and auscultation. Many clinicians and texts will begin the entire physical examination with inspection; others include arterial blood pressure measurement and pulse evaluation in the vital sign assessment, which is normally conducted prior to the physical examination.

====Arterial Pulsation====

During clinical examination, the arterial pulsations are normally measured with the patient supine (the head of the examination table should also be tilted upwards by 30-45 degrees) at the carotid arteries, the brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries, the femoral arteries, the popliteal arteries, the posterior tibial arteries, and the dorsalis pedis arteries. Care should be taken in palpation of confirmed stenosed carotid arteries. 

The arterial pulse consists of the anacrotic limb (the rapid upstroke of pulsation,) and the relaxation phase, which often ends at an incisura (a small increase in arterial pressure due to increased retrograde resistance resulting from aortic valve closure.

====Arterial Pressure====

Arterial blood pressure is the measure of lateral force on the arterial walls during the cardiac cycle. The measurement is influenced by arterial end-diastolic volume, blood viscosity, left ventricular ejection velocity, and stroke volume. Note that these factors can also be represented as the mean arterial pressure (MAP) = Cardiac output (CO) X Total peripheral resistance (TPR). Cardiac output is equal to the heart rate multiplied by stroke volume in mL, and TPR is related to blood volume/rheologic properties and peripheral arterial/arteriolar tone. With aging, the mechanical properties of arterial walls change, becoming less compliant, and thus resulting in increased pressure per voxel of blood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Birth ==
Once a protostar starts burning hydrogen in its core it becomes a main sequence star (on the main sequnce on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram)

== Main Sequence ==
During the majority of a &quot;light&quot; stars life, the center of the star has a high enough temperature and pressure that hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium.  This process releases a great deal of energy (hence the appeal of fusion for generating electricity on Earth), which further increases the temperature and pressure in the center of the star.  Eventually, this energy will work its way out of to the edges of the star, and will escape as light.

== Evolution ==
The star eventually runs out of hydrogen to &quot;burn&quot; in its center, and, if the temperature and pressure are high enough, helium will fuse into carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. [[Wikipedia:CNO_cycle|CNO Cycle]]
: The CNO Cycle is not the process of fusing helium into carbon, nitrogen and oxygen!!! The CNO cycle describes how hydrogen is fused to helium, using carbon as a sort of catalysator.

== Death ==
When the star can no longer support fusion in its core, its internal energy source is depleted, and it will slowly cool to be a white dwarf. One famous example of a white dwarf is Sirius B, companion of [[Wikipedia:Sirius|Sirius]].  It is believed that Sirius B was more massive than Sirius itself.  However, Sirius B now has as much mass as the Sun but is the size of Earth.  Sirius B is very likely a new white dwarf, because it is one of the hottest known white dwarfs, with a surface temperature of about 26000 K.  For comparison, the Sun's surface temperature is about 5770 K. In some other cases, the star will collapse and create an enormous explosion called supernova. Supernovae are extremely rare, for it only happens with a star at least 10 times bigger than our own [[../Sun/]].

A white dwarf is believed to maintain its existence by electron degeneracy pressure.  Pauli's Exclusion Principle, which states that no two electrons can be in the exact same state, provides a degeneracy pressure, which keeps the star from collapsing under its own gravity.  The critical mass for a white dwarf is about 1.4 &amp;times; ''M&lt;sub&gt;sun&lt;/sub&gt;''.

In this unit, you will learn how to ask and answer yes/no questions.

== Try It ==

Try to ask and answer the following questions using the vocabulary given. For questions, use 〜ですか。 〜 ''desu ka?'', and for answers, use はい、〜です。 ''hai,'' 〜 ''desu''. If you are in a classroom, participate with your fellow students. If you are studying independently, converse with yourself. It may help to record yourself with a tape recorder, cell phone, computer, etc.

Ex: Are you '''well'''? Yes, I am. ({{rubywikt|元気|げんき|}})
*{{furi|元気|げんき}}ですか。
*はい、{{furi|元気|げんき}}です。

#Are you '''happy'''? Yes, I am. ({{rubywikt|幸|しあわ|せ}})
#Are you '''sick'''? Yes, I am. ({{rubywikt|病気 |びょうき|}})
#Is she '''pretty'''? Yes, she is. ({{rubywikt|奇麗|きれい|}})
#Is he '''cheerful'''? Yes, he is. ({{rubywikt|陽気|ようき|}})
&lt;!-- #Are they '''bright'''? Yes, they are. ({{rubywikt|優秀|ゆうしゅう|}}) --&gt;
#Are you '''students'''? Yes, we are. ({{rubywikt|学生|がくせい|}})
#Is that '''rude'''? Yes, it is. ({{rubywikt|失礼 |しつれい|}})

== Understand ==
Duration: 3-5 minutes

=== Grammar ===

==== Particles ====
Japanese ''[[w:Japanese particles|particles]]'' (助詞 ''joshi'') are a Japanese part of speech consisting of suffixes or short words which '''follow''' other words such as nouns, verbs and adjectives, to indicate a wide range of grammatical and discursive (communicative) functions. For instance, particles are used to indicate, or ''mark'', the subject, direct object, and so on; in English, this task is normally performed by word order. Particles may also indicate the speaker's assertiveness, certitude, or other feelings. Note that a particle cannot exist by itself, it always '''follows''' another word or phrase.

&lt;!-- example sentences?
 --&gt;
==== Question Marker: か ''ka'' ====
One example of a particle is the question marker か ''ka'', so-called because it is placed at the end of a phrase to indicate that that phrase is a question. Look at the following examples:

{{Japanese example|
* {{furi|元気|げんき}}です。 &quot;I'm fine.&quot;
* {{furi|元気|げんき}}ですか。&quot;How are you?&quot;
* {{furi|学生|がくせい}}です。 &quot;She is a student.&quot;
* {{furi|学生|がくせい}}ですか。 &quot;Is she a student?&quot;
* スミスさんです。 &quot;That's Mr. Smith.&quot;
* スミスさんですか。 &quot;Is that Mr. Smith?&quot;}}

Because か ''ka'' always comes at the end of a sentence, it is called a ''sentence-final particle''. You have already been exposed to another sentence-final particle (ね ''ne'') in the first lesson. More details about this, as well as other examples of sentence-final particles, will be given in future lessons.

== Discuss ==
Duration: 0-5 minutes

If in the classroom, use this time to discuss questions the students may have.

Please post any questions you have about the lesson [[Japanese/Q&amp;A|here]], and a contributor will answer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The weaponery section needs to be more international - keeping a gun behind the bar in the UK, for example, would get you sent to jail. [[User:Tango|Tango]] 23:15, 21 December 2005 (UTC)

I'd like to see a bit of a rewrite in some areas. There are plenty of chain bars here in the UK where staff drinking is not allowed and not every country places a fine on bar staff who serve underage customers, in restaurants in the UK you may in fact serve a half pint to a minor accompanied by their parents whilst seated for a meal. And none of the skills here are required in certain venues where you are simply an autonomous worker. I'm just asking for a better clarification of the context perhaps just a rename to &quot;How to be a good bartender&quot; and a clarification that these are the qualities expected in a low traffic, high quality bar and are not representative of busy student clubs, restaurants and venues with few regulars and other venues where quality of service is not a high priority. Im sure everyone can think of a bar theyve been to where this is the case. Ive never seen a bar here give out candy so perhaps a mention that its customary in the US but maybe im wrong or the bartenders dont like me. As for the lighter for lighting customers smokeables, smoking in bars is illegal in ireland, illegal next summer in all UK countries (following a recent policy change last month from restaurants to all bars and enclosed public spaces[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4709258.stm]) and im fairly sure its illegal to smoke at the bar in a large number of US states. Something should also be mentioned while its important to be friendly sometimes you will get complete jerks demanding service and swearing and while you should give them a chance to improve their attitude you should be able to handle this and have them removed by the manager and/or security if necessary [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 01:25, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

==1. Describe the design and operation of the two-cycle engine and the four-cycle engine. ==
The four-cycle engine is easier to understand, so it is presented here first.  Once the four-cycle engine is understood, it is easier to understand the two-cycle engine.
=== Four-cycle Engine===
[[Image:4-Stroke-Engine.gif|right|Four-cycle engine]]
A four-cycle engine is so named because it makes four strokes to generate power.  These strokes are as follows:
# '''Intake Stroke:''' During this stroke the piston moves down in the cylinder, which creates vacuum, drawing air through the carburetor, and sending the mixture of fuel and air into the cylinder.  The fuel and air enters through the intake valve which opens at the beginning of this stroke.
# '''Compression Stroke:''' Once the fuel and air have been drawn into the cylinder, the intake valve closes and the piston returns towards the engine's head.  This compresses the fuel.
# '''Power Stroke:''' When the piston reaches the top of the cylinder (just before Top Dead Center or TDC), the spark plug fires, igniting the compressed fuel and air mixture and causing an explosion.  This explosion causes the gases to expand which powers the piston downwards again. This is where the engine's power comes from.
# '''Exhaust Stroke:''' When the piston reaches the bottom of the cylinder, the exhaust valve opens, and as the piston returns to the top of the cylinder again, the exhaust gases are pushed out.  When the piston reaches the top again, the four cycles are ready to repeat.

=== Two-cycle Engine===
[[Image:Two-Stroke_Engine.gif|right|Two-cycle engine]]

'''Power and Exhaust Stroke:''' In a two-cycle engine, the spark plug fires every time the piston reaches the top of the cylinder.  This is the beginning of the power and exhaust cycle.  As in the four cycle engine, the spark plug firing causes the compressed air/fuel mixture in the cylinder to explode, and the expanding gases drive the piston downward.  As the piston goes down, it compresses the air/fuel mixture beneath the piston inside the crankcase. The crankcase is the area beneath the piston, and the cylinder is the area above the piston.  When the piston nears the bottom of this stroke, it uncovers an exhaust outlet (port) and it also uncovers a passage between the crankcase and the cylinder.  The compressed air-fuel mixture in the crankcase then rushes through this passage into the cylinder, forcing the exhaust gases out of the cylinder through the exhaust port.  Some of the air/fuel mixture is also forced out the exhaust outlet, and this unfortunately decreases the engine's fuel efficiency and increases its pollution output.  The piston's head is shaped in such a way as to minimize this waste, but it does not entirely eliminate it.

'''Intake and Compression Stroke:''' After the piston reaches the bottom of the stroke, it begins traveling upwards again, compressing the air/fuel mixture that rushed into the cylinder from the crankcase during the previous stroke, and simultaneously drawing more air and fuel into the crankcase.  By the time the piston reaches the top of the cylinder, the air/fuel mixture is very highly compressed - much more compressed than it was in the crankcase.  Just before the piston reaches the top of the cylinder (TDC), the spark plug fires, beginning the cycle over again. As soon as the air/fuel mixture is ignited, and the piston begins to move down, the pressure change in the crankcase closes the intake valve, which is located in the side of the crankcase, underneath the carburetor. On most 2 cycle engines,  a reed valve is used, which is simply a piece of thin spring metal that acts as a one way valve.

Since the crankcase in a 2 cycle engine is used as part of the intake system, it can't be filled with oil like a 4 cycle, so another way to provide oil to the engine has to be used. If adequate oil wasn't provided, the engine would soon get so hot that it would begin tearing itself up, fuse together and destroy itself.  This is solved by mixing special oil into the fuel before it is put in the tank. You must use oil labeled for 2 cycle engines, or you will ruin the engine. The normal ratio specified by engine manufacturers is usually between 16/1 and 50/1 (50 parts of fuel to 1 part of oil) depending on the engine. The newer the engine, the higher the ratio (less oil) usually is. On some engines, outboard boat motors especially, Oil Injection is used, where oil from a separate tank is injected into the gasoline just before the carburetor. This results in a cleaner burning engine.  Since the oil is burned, this unfortunately increases the pollution levels generated by two-stroke engines as compared to a four-stroke engine.

==2.  Name the parts of the two-cycle engine and tell what each part does. ==
#'''Spark Plug:''' The spark plug produces an electrical spark igniting the air/fuel mixture as the piston reaches the top of the cylinder.
#''' Piston:''' The piston travels up and down inside the cylinder.  Its downward motion is propelled by an explosion of air and fuel ignited by the spark plug.
#''' Rod:''' The rod connects the piston to the crankshaft.
#'''Crankshaft:''' The crankshaft converts the piston's up-and-down motion into rotary motion and transfers the engine's power to the outside of the engine.
#'''Cylinder:''' The cylinder is the space inside the engine block in which the piston moves.  Combustion occurs at the top of the cylinder.
#'''Crankcase:''' The crankcase is the cavity in the engine block beneath the cylinder, and is where the crankshaft is. This is where fuel is drawn into the engine prior to being forced into the cylinder.
#'''Intake Port:''' The intake port is the passage-way between the crankcase and the cylinder.  
#'''Intake Valve:''' The intake valve opens to allow the air/fuel/oil mixture to enter the crankcase during the piston's up-stroke, and closes to prevent its escape, and cause it to pressurize during the piston's down-stroke.
#'''Exhaust Port:''' The exhaust port is a hole in the cylinder wall through which the burnt fuel (exhaust) is expelled.
#'''Flywheel:''' The flywheel is a mass attached to the crankshaft.  It preserves the engine's momentum, keeping the crankshaft turning between the explosions in the combustion chamber. It also has a magnet in one side, which passes by the magneto, generating the electricity to fire the spark plug.
#'''Magneto:''' The magneto sits next to the flywheel, and has a coil that acts like a generator when the magnet in the flywheel passes it. In older engines, the power from the magneto coil is switched by points, to control the timing of the spark. On newer engines, it uses electronics to control the spark, by sensing where the magnet on the flywheel is. 
#'''Fuel Filter:''' The fuel filter captures dirt in the fuel, preventing it from entering the carburetor.
#'''Carburetor:''' The carburetor is the device that mixes the fuel and air together prior to its being transferred into the engine.

==3.  List four basic fuels used in small engines, and explain their use. ==
#'''Gasoline''' is the most common fuel for small engines, especially those found on lawnmowers, snowblowers, tillers, and other garden equipment.
#'''Gasoline/oil mixture''' is used in two stroke engines.  The ratio of gas to oil is usually in the range of 16:1 to 50:1.  Two stroke engines are often found on smaller items such as chain saws and weed trimmers.
#'''Diesel''' fuel is sometimes used in larger &quot;small&quot; engines, such as those found on riding mowers, small tractors, or electric generators.  
#'''Nitromethane''' is used for ''very'' small engines, such as those that power Radio Controlled model airplanes.

==4.  Show care and safety in fuel handling and storage. ==

#Store fuel only in government-approved containers.
#Do not leave it in a car or in the back of a truck when filling it - place it on the ground.  This will prevent the build-up of static electricity which can ignite the fuel.
#After fueling an engine, wipe up any spilled fuel, and allow any remains to evaporate before starting the engine.
#Always move the engine at least 10 feet from where you filled it, and the gas can before starting it.
#Never add fuel to, or open the filler cap on or near a running engine.
#Do not smoke or allow anyone to smoke within 50 feet of an open fuel tank.
#Do not fill the container more than 90-95% full to allow room for expansion.
#Do not store a fuel container in the trunk of a car, in direct sunlight, or near an open flame or source of sparks.
#Keep the fuel nozzle in constant contact with the container when filling it.  Keep the container's nozzle in constant contact with the fuel tank when adding fuel to the engine.

==5. Describe three types of ignition systems. ==
Material for this section was adapted from the Wikipedia article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_system Ignition Systems]
===Glow plug ignition===
Glow plug ignition is used on some kinds of simple engines, such as those commonly used for model aircraft. A glow plug is a coil of wire (made from nichrome normally) that will glow red hot when an electric current is passed through it. This ignites the fuel on contact, once the temperature of the fuel is already raised due to compression. The coil is electrically activated for engine starting, but once running, the coil will retain sufficient residual heat on each stroke due to the heat generated on the previous stroke. Glow plugs are also used to aid starting of diesel engines.

===Magneto system===
The simplest form of spark ignition is that using a magneto. The engine spins a magnet (normally cast into the outer edge of the flywheel) past a coil, and also operates a contact breaker called &quot;points&quot;, interrupting the current and causing the voltage to be increased sufficiently to jump a small gap. The spark plugs are connected directly to the magneto coil. Magnetos are not used in modern cars, but because they generate their own electricity they are often found on small engines such as mopeds, lawnmowers, snowblowers, chainsaws, etc. where there is no battery, and also in aircraft piston engines.

===Battery Ignition===
Battery ignition systems are very similar to the magneto ignition system, except that electricity is drawn from a battery rather than being induced by rotating a magnet past a coil.  The battery is recharged by the engine's alternator.  Battery systems are capable of delivering sparks to multiple cylinders which are selected by a rotor in the distributor.  The advantage of a battery ignition system is that the timing of the spark may be adjusted to increase the engine's efficiency based on how fast it is turning.  Older battery ignition systems used breaker points (often referred to as the &quot;Points&quot;) which were opened and closed by a cam run off of the crankshaft to control the timing of the spark. The shortcoming of this system was that the timing stayed the same for all engine speeds, but the engine needs different timing for high speed than at idle. To make up for this, various engines used various systems to adjust the timing, such as vacuum and centrifugal advance, which always had problems. Now almost all engines use Electronic Ignition, which has a sensor on the engine that tells the electronics where the engine is, and how fast it is going, and adjusts the timing accordingly.

==6. Explain why gasoline is an improper cleaning fluid. ==
Gasoline is extremely flammable and dangerous to work with.  It is also a carcinogen (cancer-causing agent), so prolonged contact with it should be avoided.  It can also damage plastic parts.  Gasoline left on parts can burst into flame at the slightest provocation, causing an engine fire. It also has many additives, some of which stay on the part after you clean it. They also soak into your bloodstream.

==7. List two acceptable cleaning fluids for small engines. ==
'''Mineral Spirits''' are often used for cleaning parts.  Soaking parts in mineral spriits removes oil and grease without the need for scrubbing.  Once the parts are removed from the bath, the mineral spirits quickly evaporate.

'''Environmentally Friendly Alternatives:''' There are many degreasers on the market today, and many of them are billed as &quot;environmentally friendly.&quot;  Examples include Simple Green, and various citrus-based cleaners containing [[w:en:limonene|limonene]] such as Citrus King, and Orange Power.  These cleaners do require scrubbing, but they are all biodegradable.

==8. List and tell how three basic lubrication systems operate. ==
*'''Splash:''' In a splash lubrication system, dippers on the crankshaft are repeatedly submerged and lifted out of the oil in the oil pan.  This happens as the crankshaft turns.  When the dippers emerge from the oil bath, oil is splashed all about the inside of the chamber where it finds its way to the pistons, rods, and other moving parts.  Channels are milled in the crankshaft to direct oil flow from the dippers to the bearings in the crankshaft, as it is vital that these receive plenty of lubrication.

*'''Pressurized:''' In a Pressurized lubrication system, an oil pump sucks oil from the oil pan and forces it through a filter and then on through a system of passageways drilled into various parts of the engine.  These passageways are called ''galleries.''  The galleries open to spurt the oil onto critical components such as the bearings.  Galleries are also drilled from the main block and from there into the crankshaft's main bearing.  This connects to another gallery drilled into the crankshaft itself.  The crankshaft gallery supplies oil to the connecting rod bearings.

*'''Combination Splash/Pressure:'''  As the name suggests, a Combination Splash/Pressure lubrication system is a combination of the two systems described above.  The connection between the rod and the piston, as well as the cylinder walls, are lubricated using the splash method. The main crankshaft bearings, as well as the camshaft, rocker arms, Etc. are lubricated by the pressurized system.

*'''Dry Sump:''' In a Dry Sump lubrication system, there is no oil in the oil pan. It is all stored in a pressurized reservoir, and then fed to the engine by the pump. Galleries are drilled in the crankshaft just as in the Pressurized system.  But these galleries are also connected to galleries drilled in the connecting rod, and then through the pistons themselves.  Oil is squeezed through these galleries where it spills out onto the cylinder wall.

==9. List in order the steps of a general trouble-shooting procedure. ==
Remember the acronym '''FAST''' - '''F'''uel, '''A'''ir, '''S'''park, and '''T'''iming.

*'''Fuel:''' Make sure fuel is getting into the combustion chamber.  The most obvious thing is to make sure the engine is not out of gas.  Then check the fuel lines, making sure they are in good shape and actually connected to what they should be connected to.  If the engine is flooded (that is, it has too much fuel in the carburetor), let it sit for a while, and then try starting it again.  If the engine has a fuel pump, make sure it's operating.  Check that the filter is not clogged.  A very common problem with small engines, especially after they have been sitting for a while, is for the carburetor to get clogged, or have the diaphragms get old and stiff. A normal carb is not very difficult to dissemble and clean, and rebuild kits can be obtained for a few dollars and will often  solve the problem if you are still having problems after you check everything else. If all of these check out, move on to the next stage in the acronym, which is '''air.'''

*'''Air:''' Make sure the choke is adjusted properly.  On an engine with a manual choke, close the choke all the way and open up the throttle.  Then try to start it.  If it doesn't start after a couple of pulls, open the choke halfway and try again.  When the engine starts, open the choke over the next few seconds until the engine runs smoothly.  If it still won't start, check that the air filter is not clogged.

*'''Spark:''' Check that you have spark, and that it is a good strong blue spark.  You can use a spark tester, unscrew the sparkplug and hold the outer threaded part against the metal of the engine as you crank the engine and watch for a spark, or just hold the end of the spark plug wire 1/8&quot; to 1/4&quot; inch away from the metal of the engine as you crank the engine. Be careful not to touch the metal tip! The shock will really hurt, and it could cause serious injury, especially if you have a pacemaker. If it is an older style engine with points, you should check them. After a while, they can get dirty or corroded, or just wear away. They are often under the flywheel. Electronic ignition engines can have the module burn out. Or you could have a loose wire somewhere, or the kill switch could be shorted.

*'''Timing:''' On small engines, you normally can't adjust the timing, but that doesn't mean it can't be wrong! It is common on certain engines (Briggs and Stratton for instance) for the key holding the flywheel to the shaft to shear, (they are designed to do this to protect other parts of the engine, kind of like a fuse), and when it shears, the flywheel turns on the shaft. so you will still get a spark, but it won't be at the right time. so you should check the flywheel is in the correct position on the crankshaft. Engines that use a point style ignition system sometimes have an adjustment on the points, which are usually under the flywheel.

==10. Demonstrate that you can overhaul, inspect, and properly tune any small engine. ==
Consult with a Qualified Person for this part!
Don't just tear into the family lawnmower, and hope you can get it all back together. You are likely to end up with &quot;extra&quot; parts left over when you are done! (which is not a good thing)

==11. Demonstrate that you know how to test and clean spark plugs and glow plugs. ==
A toothbrush can be a good tool to clean spark plugs. (Don't use it to brush your teeth afterwards though!) You also need to use a spark plug gap gage, or a feeler gage to set the spark plug gap according to the engine specs. When cleaning them, you just need to get all the carbon and soot buildup off. These days, sparkplugs are usually just replaced if they are full of crud.

      <text xml:space="preserve">All you ever wanted to know about regulating your watch yourself...and why you wished you hadn't asked...

I’ve noticed a lot of posts lately from people wanting to know how to regulate a Seiko 7S26 movement, and whilst there have been various posts in the past on this topic, there’s nothing tying it all neatly together in one post. So, having got me a Vibrograf timing machine recently (as if you didn’t know), I thought I’d cover the basics and also demonstrate how the machine works, and what it can do.


First, the basics.

1. Regulating a mechanical watch means making it run slightly faster or slower, by making a small change in the effective length of the balance hairspring. The shorter the effective length, the quicker the balance completes its swing and so the watch runs faster. If the effective length is made greater, the opposite occurs. This change is made by moving the regulating lever, marked ‘A’ in the photo below. Note that there is also a beat adjustment lever, marked ‘B’ in the photo. This lever should NOT be touched, unless you suspect the movement is ‘out of beat’ and you have some sort of instrument such as a watch timer which will allow you to see when it is ‘in beat’ again. I will explain these terms more fully later on.

[[image:Watchregulating177f.jpg]]


Note that regulation is not the same thing as adjustment. To adjust a watch is to compensate for all the various factors that can affect timekeeping. This can be a complex and long-winded process, and is best left to professionals. Regulation is performed as the final ‘tweaking’ after adjustment has been carried out. As far as we are concerned in this post, we shall assume no adjustment is necessary, only regulation.

2. Unless a watch is in good mechanical condition and adjustment, it’s really a waste of time trying to regulate it within a dozen or so seconds per day. By ‘good mechanical condition’ I mean the movement is free of dirt and is adequately lubricated with clean oil, there are no excessively worn bearings, the mainspring can supply a steady flow of power to the gear train, there are no chipped or missing gear teeth or pinions, etc. Similarly, it’s very optimistic to expect a cheap, low jewel-count movement to perform well on a regular basis. However, even an entry-level movement such as the Seiko 7S26 can produce astonishing results, as we shall see.

3. It’s important to realize that there are many factors that conspire against consistent timekeeping when a watch is worn. These include change in position (e.g. dial up, crown down, crown up), change in temperature, change in mainspring state-of-wind, and personal wearing habits of the owner (e.g. worn 24/7 or taken off at night, what position is it left in at night, shocks and bumps from sports activity, etc.). Whilst modern materials have reduced the effects of temperature and mainspring state-of-wind (also known as isochronism from the Greek meaning ‘equal time’), they still come into play, along with ever-present gravity. Thus, in regulating a movement we can only try to compensate for all the ‘errors’ caused by these factors on an overall basis. It’s important then that before attempting any regulation, the watch must be observed over several days of normal wear to establish how much it gains or loses each day, or its daily rate. It is this rate that is the starting point for regulation.


The Vibrograf machine

The Vibrograf was invented and developed in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, about 45 years ago by Portescap, the creators of the Incabloc shock absorber. Various models have been produced over the years, and because of its simplicity and reliability the B200 became the watchmaker’s standard workhorse. Although now superseded by more sophisticated (and expensive) machines such as those made by Witschi, the B200 is still more than adequate for simple diagnosis and regulation. In addition to mechanical movements it can, with the appropriate optional circuits, also be used for electro-mechanical, tuning fork and quartz clock movements.


How it works

The basic components of the B200 are an inductive pick-up mounted on a multi-positional arm; an amplifier; a quartz oscillator giving an extremely stable time base; a paper tape printer; and a read-out scale. The pick-up (which is basically a microphone) conveys the sound of the watch movement to the amplifier, and it is then compared to the time base. The printer then records the difference between the two frequencies onto a moving paper tape. The resulting linear trace (called a vibrogram) can then be analysed to determine the watch’s instantaneous rate and also a variety of defects such as beat irregularity, damaged escape-wheel teeth, out of poise balance, wrong type of mainspring, damaged pallet stone, dirty escapement, etc.

How it’s used

First, the beat frequency of the movement to be tested (e.g. 21,600 bph) is selected by means of the black push-buttons on the front of the machine. Almost any standard frequency between 3,600 and 36,000 bph can be selected. Next, the watch is fixed (dial up or dial down) to the inductive pick-up by means of the built-in spring-loaded clamp. (For watches with thick cases or plastic movement rings, better results are achieved if the crown is in contact with one of the prongs of the clamp.) The amplifier is then switched on by means of the round black knob on the front panel. This knob is also the volume control. Nothing will be heard at this stage, unless headphones are plugged into the back of the machine.

To start the paper tape recorder the red push-button is depressed, and the volume knob is rotated until the sound of the movement ‘ticking’ can be heard. At that point a linear trace will appear on the paper. There are actually three major sounds associated with the escapement, but the amplifier is designed to use the most distinct one, which is the sound of the impulse pin on the balance hitting the notch of the lever fork. This is also known as the ‘unlocking’. When enough trace has been produced the large black knob on the sloping face of the machine is rotated so that the engraved lines on the clear plastic reading disc (to which it is geared) are parallel to the trace. The instantaneous rate can then be read directly from the dial under the large black knob. In the photo the rate is +18 sec/day in the dial up position.

The above operation is repeated with the watch in various positions (e.g. dial down, crown down), to see what the positional variations are. A difference of about 30sec/day between horizontal and vertical positions can be considered as ‘normal’ in an average-quality movement. If the positional differences are really large it can indicate basic faults within the movement, which will work against consistent timekeeping.


Interpreting the results

The trace produced by the machine is usually a single continuous straight line that may slope to the left or right, depending on whether the rate is losing or gaining. Sometimes the trace shows two parallel lines a small distance apart. This indicates the movement is ‘out of beat’, which means that the length of arc the balance swings through in one direction from the midpoint is not the same as in the other. Put simply, the length of the ‘tick’ is not equal to the length of the ‘tock’. Ideally, to achieve the best regulation possible the movement should be put ‘into beat’ by moving the beat lever (sometimes called the stud carrier), so that the balance swings through an equal arc on both sides. The effect of moving this lever is easy to see on the trace, but hard to distinguish without a machine of some sort. A movement that is ‘in beat’ starts easily and, provided there is enough power from the mainspring, is difficult to stop. Conversely a movement that is out of beat runs irregularly, is hard to start and is prone to stopping.

Traces that display a recurring irregularity or a sinusoidal effect (wavy line), divergence of the trace lines or sharp changes in direction when moving from a horizontal to a vertical position and vice versa all indicate certain defects that require correction before successful regulation can be carried out.


Practical Examples

1. Brand new Seiko SKX779 ‘Black Monster’
This watch utilizes the common or garden 7S26A 21-jewel movement that is regarded as the entry-level for Seiko automatics. Seiko themselves don’t hold out any great expectations for it, not even being game enough to quote acceptable accuracy limits in the instruction booklet that came with it. It’s known as a workhorse rather than a thoroughbred. After a couple of weeks’ wear it was running at +15 seconds/day—not bad but capable of improvement, I was sure. This was with being worn during the day (so the mainspring was nicely wound), and left dial up at night. 

I popped it on the Vibrograf and got the following results:
Dial up +30 s/d
Dial down +30 s/d
Crown up +30 s/d
Crown down +36 s/d
Crown left +27 s/d

To say I was surprised at the consistency of these results is an understatement—I was gobsmacked. Was I looking at a 7S26 or a classic Omega Observatory calibre? This augured well for a good result.

[[Image:Bwc7s26Monster1168.jpg]]

.
Since the timing machine showed the watch to be running fast by about 30s/d, and when being worn it gained only 15 s/d, my “personal wear error” was a loss of 15 s/d. I therefore had to bear this in mind when regulating the rate. (NB It is conventional wisdom that watches lose about 30 s/d when being worn, which may be why Seiko send them out from the factory running fast.)
I undid the bracelet, carefully removed the caseback and put the watch dial down on the pickup. After re-checking the rate I gave the regulator lever a tiny nudge in the loss (—) direction to reduce it by 15 seconds. I let the movement settle down, then checked it again. Oops, 15 s/d too far. Another fractional nudge in the gain (+) direction and a recheck. Spot on—the machine said +15. Combined with my personal error of –15, the watch should in theory now neither gain nor lose whilst being worn in my usual manner.
I set the Monster to within a few seconds of atomic time and made a note of the exact offset. After wearing the watch for 4 days I checked it again against atomic time. The result? It had gained 1 second total over the 4 days. Can’t complain about that!

2. 1979 Seiko 6309-7040 17-jewels
This recent acquisition had an unknown service history but was running strongly at –24 s/d in daily wear. The vibrogram looked OK but showed the following:
Dial up +4 s/d
Dial down -20 s/d
Crown down -56 s/d

Hmmm, quite a bit of positional variation, possibly indicating considerable wear and/or an unpoised balance. This one wasn’t going to be so easy as the new Monster.

The regulator lever turned out to be very touchy and it took me quite a few tries to get near my target of +4 s/d (dial down). In the end I had to settle for +2 s/d as being ‘near enough’. After 4 days of normal wear the 6309 had only lost 3 seconds, which in my book is more than satisfactory (and rather surprising, given the positional variations).

How to regulate without a timing machine

Although having some sort of timing machine speeds up the process, it is perfectly possible to regulate your watches yourself with a little patience. Here’s how:

1. Wear the watch for several days in your normal manner, and make a note of the average gain or loss per day (your “personal error”) against atomic time or another known accurate time source such as an eco-drive or other quality quartz watch.

2. Remove the caseback carefully using a well-fitting opener (you may want to use masking tape on the caseback to avoid scratching it), and locate the regulator lever, screw or index. (See photos below for examples of the various types of regulator. They can be marked + and - , F(ast) and S(low) , or A(vance=fast) and R(etard=slow.)

[[Image:BwcMM mvta.jpg]]
[[Image:BwcOmega911a.jpg]]
[[Image:321 balance a.jpg]] 
[[Image:BwcPresmatic.jpg]]


 
3. In the case of a lever or index, hold a toothpick or the outside edge of a pair of watchmaker’s tweezers (e.g. #5’s) vertically, and gently nudge the lever so the pointer moves to counteract your personal error (p.e.). For example, if your p.e. is +20 sec/day, move the lever in the –ve or loss direction. If you’re unsure which is the correct direction, just remember that moving the regulator lever TOWARDS the stud carrier will effectively LENGTHEN the hairspring and thus SLOW DOWN the rate. Moving the regulator AWAY from the stud carrier will effectively SHORTEN the hairspring and thus SPEED UP the rate.

BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH THE HAIRSPRING—IT IS VERY DELICATE AND EASILY DAMAGED. Also, you only need to move the lever a very small amount—a little movement can make a big change in the daily rate. It helps to use a loupe (jeweller’s eyeglass) whilst doing this.
I prefer to hold the toothpick/tweezers vertically as it is easier to control the movements of the lever. Pushing on the lever horizontally can lead to ‘overshooting the mark’ and the risk of the implement slipping off and damaging the hairspring.
In the case of a microregulator with an adjusting screw, use a well-fitting screwdriver in the screw’s slot to turn it slightly in the appropriate direction.

4. Replace the caseback finger tight, making sure any seal or gasket is replaced correctly in its groove and is not pinched. Do not put the watch near any moisture or dust-laden environment until the regulation process is complete.

5. Wear the watch normally for 24 hours, noting the new daily rate. If necessary, repeat steps 2-5 until you are satisfied with your watch’s performance.

6. Tighten the caseback fully with the wrench, again making sure the seal/gasket is in good condition and correctly fitted. If you intend wearing the watch in water it is highly recommended to fit a new seal properly lubricated with silicon grease. Good luck and happy regulating!

== To [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] == 
While I appreciate your enthusiasm for editing other people's work, I don't appreciate you making changes to my work without prior discussion, as you did (again) in the case of this book. I do in fact intend to complete the basics of this book myself as time permits, but the holidays have severely limited the time that I can devote to it. In addition, I'm currently trying to get some issues resolved with some of the software used. Thank you. --[[User:Jnavas|John Navas]] 06:32, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

== TMPGEnc Xpress 4.0 AC3 ==

AC3 encoding is built into TMPGEnc Xpress 4.0. Works fine.

I added that and revised a few sentences of other notes.  [[User:71.202.20.47|71.202.20.47]] 22:29, 26 April 2007 (UTC) [[User:Joe n bloe|Joe n bloe]] 22:30, 26 April 2007 (UTC) (new account)

'''Also:''' This should be updated to reflect the large number of new features and filters available in TMPGEnc Express 4.0. The filters include pretty good noise reduction, sharpening, so on. If it does what you need it's a lot less painful than mplayer/mencoder, although mencoder is still probably the most versatile transcoder in existence. It's also nice not to have to deal with Avisynth. 

This guide should probably include mencoder and avidemux, both of which have pretty solid Windows ports nowadays. [[User:Joe n bloe|Joe n bloe]] 22:40, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

== I Recommend a Rename ==

I'd like to rename this book &quot;[[Video Capture, Transcoding, and Authoring]].&quot; (or something similar) It could and IMO should be a lot broader.

I have a fair bit of material from a few years back when I did a lot of capture and transcoding in Linux. Currently I'm doing the same but on Windows, using whatever tools are at hand, including DVD authoring with DVD-lab. I can put a lot of the text I wrote previously in here.

This can be a tremendously challenging endeavor and I'd like to share my experiences about what works. Good advice can save people days of misery and frustration.

I think your ([[User:Jnavas|John Navas]]) guide is very helpful and sensible, but it needs a lot of expansion and some reorganization. Not to brag, but I'm the author of a published book (Effective Perl Programming), and I have quite a bit of writing experience that I could bring to bear.

I'm going to start some chapters under [[Video_Capture,_Transcoding,_and_Authoring]]/xxxxxx. If a few weeks or months go by without a response from you, and I still have time to do some work myself, I'll probably rename this book.

I hope you see this as help and not just mucking about with your stuff. I will certainly respect your work; however, Wikibooks and Wikipedia are collaborative efforts and anyone who can make legitimate and constructive contributions, and has the time to do so, should be free to contribute. [[User:Joe n bloe|Joe n bloe]] 23:57, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

== This Guide (Needs Help / Is Worthless) ==
For what it's worth, I'll enter the disclaimer that I am a professional technical writer.  That being said, this guide is useless.  Where is the step-by-step?  Where are *ANY* screenshots?  If I wrote a guide like this, I'd be fired!  This assumes knowlege of both software titles required, giving the user zero guidance.  If I knew both AVISynth and TMPGEnc Xpress so thoroughly, I wouldn't need a guide at all!  I recommend this guide's deletion.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==God is==
'''God''' is the higher power, worshiped by the majority of people in the world. The Christian God is an infinite and absolute being; a perfect spirit—eternal, immutable, omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good, the true and righteous Almighty Creator God the Father. Fully addressed as Father in the sense of the doctrine of the Trinity which declares the union of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit as Three Persons and One God. The term persons is not applied in Scripture to the Trinity, but something analogous to the conception of personality seems to be implied in the apostolic statements of the New Testament epistles.

The arguments for the existence of God have been divided into the ontological, the psychological, the cosmological, the teleological and the moral. The ontological argument starts from the idea of God itself and professes to demonstrate the existence of God as a necessary consequence from that idea. The manner in which it was stated by Anselm, in the eleventh century, is this: &quot;God must be thought of as that being than whom none can be thought greater; but this being, the highest and most perfect that we can conceive, may be thought as existing in actuality as well as in thought—that is to say, may be thought as something still greater; therefore God, or what is thought as greatest, must exist not only in thought but in fact.&quot; This argument has been presented in other forms. Descartes, while refuting Anselm’s form of the ontological argument, revived it himself in another form. Applying the test of truth which he derived from his celebrated formula—&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;—that whatever we clearly and distinctly perceive to belong to the true and unalterable nature of a thing may be predicated of it, he found on investigating God that existence belongs to his true and unalterable nature and therefore may legitimately be affirmed of God becasue hes the living one

Another argument, called the psychological, was adduced by Descartes to prove the existence of God, which, although not the same as the ontological argument, appears to resemble it. It starts from the idea of a supreme and perfect being, but it does not assert the objective existence of that being as implied in its idea, but infers such objective existence on the ground that we could have acquired the idea only from the being which corresponds to it. 

The cosmological argument starts not from an idea, but from a contingent existence, and infers from it an absolutely necessary being as its cause. The argument is: Every new thing and every change in a previously existing thing must have a cause sufficient and pre-existing. The universe consists of a system of changes. Therefore the universe must have a cause outside of and before itself. 

The argument called teleological is that which is commonly known as the argument from design and has been fully illustrated by Paley in his ''Natural Theology''. It is simply this, that in nature there are unmistakable evidences of the adaptation of means to ends, which lead us inevitably to the idea of some intelligence that planned this adaptation, that is, of God.

The moral argument is derived from the constitution and history of man and his relations to the universe, being based on such considerations as our recognition of good and evil, right and wrong, the cautions received of conscience and the fact that a moral government of the world may be observed. Another argument is based on the alleged fact that a belief in the existence of a supreme being is everywhere found to be implanted in the human breast. This argument is used by Cicero among others, and many thinkers are inclined to give a good deal of weight to it; still it is pronounced by others to be at best only a probable argument, if it may be accepted as valid to prove anything at all. Others argue the existence of God from the manifestations which he has made of himself to mankind, but these, as well as miracles, it is admitted even by Christian theists, may only be accepted as real by such as previously believed in the divine existence, still, the facts of religious history speak of just such divine providence in human affairs as to define the very God in question.

::''For so greatly did God love the world that He gave His only born Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not be subject to death but have eternal Life''.

==Life==
'''Jesus Christ''' was born in Bethlehem, Judea, according to the generally accepted chronology in the year of Rome 750, that is, 4 BC. This apparent discrepancy in date is due to an error that was made when the Christian calendar originated with Dionysius in 556 AD. He fixed upon the year of Rome 754 as that in which Christ was born. Later information proved beyond a doubt that this date should have been 750, which gives the birth of Christ four years before the beginning of the Christian era according to the calendar of Dionysius. The mother of Jesus was Mary, who was probably a descendant of David. Her husband, Joseph, was also a descendant of the same family. The birth of the holy child occurred in a manger at a public inn in Bethlehem, where Joseph had gone to be registered in his place of origin in accordance with the Roman census and Jewish law relating to taxation. The miraculous conditions connected with his birth to the Virgin Mary prove to the satisfaction of most followers of Christianity that Jesus was of divine origin. His parents remained at Bethlehem for some time. The infant Savior was circumcised on the eighth day, and at the end of the fortieth day he was presented in the Temple, and his mother, according to the Jewish law, made the customary offers for her purification. Soon after this he was visited by wise men, or Magi, from the East, who claimed to have been guided to the spot where he was by the miraculous appearance of a star. Inquiries of these men as to where the child who was to be king of the Jews was born, led Herod (at that time ruler of Judea under Rome) to order that all the male children in Bethlehem under the age of three years were to be put to death. Joseph, however, was warned by an angel, and he fled with Mary and Jesus into Egypt, where he remained an uncertain length of time, until after Herod's death, when the holy family returned and took up their residence at Nazareth. There, Jesus lived and grew to maturity, and because of that connection he is frequently called the Nazarene.

Of the boyhood and youth of Jesus almost nothing is known. The only authentic account given is that of his appearance in the Temple when twelve years of age (Luke 2: 46-50). All details concerning his life previous to his public ministry are without foundation, but it is probable that he remained with the family at Nazareth and engaged in the same work as his father, who was a carpenter. The public ministry of Jesus was preceded by the preaching of John the Baptist, his cousin, who proclaimed the coming of the kingdom of God and called men to repentance. Jesus was pointed out by John as the Son of God, and two of John's disciples from that time became his followers. He was baptized by John, when his divine nature was manifested by the miraculous appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove and by a voice from heaven saying, &quot;This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.&quot; After the initial meeting, his new followers declared Jesus, the Christ, or the expected Jewish Messiah. Following the baptism, Jesus retired into the wilderness of Judea, where he was subjected to various temptations. His first public appearance was at the marriage in Cana of Galilee, where he performed the miracle of turning water into wine. He then visited Capernaum, affirmed the apostles Andrew, Peter, James and John nearby and later appeared in Jerusalem at the time of the Passover to reveal his majesty and power by cleansing the Temple of those who were changing money and selling animals for sacrifice. He received an inquisitive teacher of Israel at night by the name of Nicodemus and pointed out the way to everlasting life. His works and teachings immediately aroused the opposition of the leaders of the Jews because the news was spreading over Judea that Jesus' disciples were baptizing even more new adherents than John the Baptist and, finding that this work in Judea was to be rejected, he departed into Galilee. During the remainder of the first year of his ministry he preached at Nazareth, where his own townspeople attempted to cast him over a precipice because of his teachings; then at Capernaum again. After the calling of his disciples he began his first circuit through Galilee. During this time occurred the Sermon on the Mount; also the Sermon in the Boat, which was followed by the miraculous draught of fishes. Near the close of this year he called Levi, or Matthew, who became one of his most devoted followers.

The second year's ministry began with the attendance upon the Passover at Jerusalem and the healing of the lame man at the Pool of Bethesda. Following this were several other miracles, followed by discussions with the Pharisees and other leaders of the Jews, in which Jesus continued (Matthew 9: 12-13) to set forth his gospel, or good news, calling for repentance and the forgiveness of sins, and showed clearly the difference between this new dispensation and the underlying principles of the Jewish law and the ceremonials largely practiced at that time. This increased the already growing opposition and was followed by the sending out of the twelve disciples to promulgate his teaching concerning entry into the kingdom of heaven. After the visit to Jerusalem, Jesus began his second general circuit through Galilee. This circuit was characterized by the performing of a number of miracles and the relating of some of the most important parables in the Gospels, among them those of the sower, of the tares, of the mustard seed, of the leaven and of the hid treasure. This was followed by the third general circuit, during which occurred the death of John the Baptist, the feeding of the five thousand and the walking on water.
[[Image:Upper_room.jpg|right|350px|thumb|&lt;span style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Upper room in first century Palestine&lt;/span&gt;]]
The third and last year of Jesus' ministry was by far the most important with many discourses, parables, and miracles recorded, the year which saw the Transfiguration, curing of an epileptic boy, his appearance at the Feast of Tabernacles, sending out the seventy to prepare the way with all power over demons and disease, his calling the fallen Prince of this world to account, and the raising of Lazarus which so aroused the envy of the Jews that they resolved upon putting him to death, while just before the events of the last week leading up to the crucifixion, generally known as the Passion Week, he stopped everything to welcome the little children into his presence, for such is the kingdom of God. After which he warned about the dangers of the accumulation of wealth, and then gave a prediction of his own death and resurrection for the third time. As his passion drew near, Jesus prepared to eat the last Passover with his disciples. On the first day of the week, which is still remembered as Palm Sunday, he made his triumphal entrance into Jerusalem as the long awaited but unique Son of David. During the next two days he spent his time in and around the city, cursing a barren fig-tree, cleansing the Temple, predicting the destruction of Jerusalem and the nation, sealing the judgment to come with separation of the sheep from the goats and delivering discourses in which he used a number of parables, in particular, those conveyed in private to his disciples to answer the ultimate questions concerning his mission. These things accomplished, he retired to Bethany. On Wednesday he gave a warning of the betrayal by one of his own, and on the following day in a specially prepared upper room in the holy city he ate the last Passover with his disciples assuring them that after his departure he would come again to usher in his kingdom and during the discourse proclaimed the wine and the bread a lasting remembrance of the new covenant established that evening, additionally, a new commandment was directed to his disciples: that you love one another as I have loved you, for greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. After the Passover meal, having been betrayed by Judas, he was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane, brought before the high priest Caiaphas, condemned by the Jewish Sanhedrin for claims of divinity (Mark 14: 62) and early on Friday morning sent before Pilate, the Roman governor of Jerusalem, in order that the sentence of death might be legally confirmed, which led to the requisite punishment of flagellation and further humiliation. By Pilate he was released to the Jews, by whose compliance he was crucified on that day. Late in the afternoon, Jesus cried out, “It is finished,” and yielded up the spirit. The Sabbath approached demanding his body be taken down from the cross and prepared for burial by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. The tomb was one belonging to this same Joseph, a member of the Sanhedrin, a man of considerable means, and there the body of Jesus was buried that same day in a garden close to Golgotha, the place of the skull, the site of the crucifixion.

==Resurrection==
On the morning of the first day of the week, or the third day after his death, Mary Magdalene and other women in charge of the spices hastened to the tomb in order to complete the work of embalming the body, but they found the stone rolled away from the door of the tomb and the place where Jesus had lain occupied by an angel, who told them that Jesus had risen. After his resurrection on that Sunday which would later be celebrated as Easter Sunday, Jesus remained on earth for forty days, during which time he appeared eleven times to his disciples and followers, the instance (John 20: 27-28) of a doubting Thomas tempered all unbelief. Jesus commissioned his disciples to continue his earthly ministry and at the last gathering on the Mount of Olives he ascended into heaven and was received by a cloud out of their sight. The disciples stood there awestruck with eyes skyward after the ascension and heavenly messengers in attendance (Acts 1: 11) announced that his return will be in like manner at the end of the age. They returned to the upper room in Jerusalem as instructed and devoted themselves to worship and fellowship together in the common calling while planning for the future, with earnest [[../Prayer|prayer]], blessing God continually. Their numbers increased to 120 believers as they awaited the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, or Advocate, as promised by the risen Savior. 

The belief in the resurrection of Christ is one of the Christian articles of faith. Secular explanations of the resurrection include (1) that according to the statement of the Jews, the disciples stole the body and then published the story that their Lord was risen; (2) that Jesus had not really died on the cross; that His apparent death was only a swoon, from which He afterward recovered; (3) that there had been no real resurrection and that the disciples had been deceived by visionary appearances or hallucinations; (4) that the assertion of the resurrection was originally allegorical. In Acts, chapter 5, the words of one of the most learned Jews of the time, Gamaliel, are more to the point, “put forth [the apostles] a little space... for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to naught: but if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it.” Thus, with regard to the significance of Christ's resurrection, to Christians it is the crowning event, evidence of the divine character of His mission and His atonement for the sins of the world.

==Teaching==
The great commandment according to the gospel was love the Lord your God with all your heart and the second, similar to it, love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus reinforced his teaching by miracles and by parables. His miracles were evidently for the purpose of convincing the people of his divine origin and power. They were thirty-five in number and ranged in importance from the turning of water into wine to the raising of the dead to life. Most of them were connected with the healing of disease and a majority of those contained a demonstration of the petitioner's faith, and with few exceptions all of them were for the welfare of those upon whom or in whose favor they were wrought. The parables, forceful maxims of a metaphorical nature such as the Pearl of Great Price, the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan, were thirty-three in number and contain the best illustrations of moral and religious truth to be found anywhere in literature. So broad is their application that the truths which they teach are accepted by the non-Christian as well as by the Christian world.

Could we consider merging the many millions of Design Pattern articles in WikiPedia/Books? Clearly we keep the different Design Patterns seperate, but I see no sense in having an entries in WikiPedia, the C -/-/- Design Pattern book, this Design Patterns book, the Java Design Patterns book, ... you get my point?

Should we not rather focus on fixing a set of design pattern articles in one place (I propose WikiPedia) and link to it from various other places? I see no sense in defining the Template Method Pattern, or more abstractly, Behavioural Patterns, four times (or however many WikiBooks there are on the topic) --[[User:Nanderman|The Extremist]] 13:36, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

== Merge request ==
I've acted on the pending merge request to the C++ Programming book and noticed that some of the content was duplicated, I have extracted all the C++ source examples and since there is still much useful content to RfD or complete a merge of the edit history I will re-tag it as a merge to the Java book (since most of the content may already be present or be useful there). If the request is opposed or after the Java content is removed/merged, please re-tag the remaining to be merged into the [[Computer Programming]]...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:56, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
:I searched for the word &quot;Design patterns&quot; and found out that the subject is scattered all over the computer language books, which results in information duplication, making the access to all the knowledge about a design pattern subject at one place impossible. As a matter of fact, design patters can and ''should'' be used to implement code in specific languages, but the subject is high level compared to language details. I think that there should be a &quot;software architecture book&quot; with design pattern explained there. The merge place could be at [[Introduction to Software Engineering/Architecture/Design Patterns]] or here - that doesn't matter.

:I do not fully understand the &quot;Wiki-speak&quot;, but merging these examples to specific language books would be incorrect. I agree with [[User:Sae1962|Sae1962]], for this subject, the correct place for the code is under [[Computer_Science_Design_Patterns]]/whatever-pattern-name. Then have a link from each relevant language specific book to [[Computer_Science_Design_Patterns]]. I understand this would be an exception to the general rule of where examples should be collected, but this is what I would expect, and I believe my peers will expect the same. 
:A second point, when the C++ example was moved to the C++ book was a link created? I cannot find one, it may be just an oversight, but I could not navigate from [[Visitor pattern]] to the example I wanted. This is what has made me sign-up as a contributor! -- [[User:Rfrankla|Rfrankla]] ([[User talk:Rfrankla|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rfrankla|contribs]]) 12:43, 21 April 2014 (UTC)

::I see no point in continuing the debate about merging since the work has been reformatted a lot from the source initial proposed for merge in 2011 that it makes no sense in 2014, I would have hoped someone had closed it a long time ago (after 7 days of no opposition a proposal should be considered dead unless someone wishes to pursue the matter further).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:23, 16 July 2014 (UTC)

== Design Patterns aren't code reuse ==

The opening sentence says design patterns are &quot;convenient ways of reusing your code&quot;. Aren't design patterns design reuse rather than code reuse? Maybe it's better to say design patterns offer general solutions to reoccurring design problems.

# Spread the substance on the breading mix in the form of burger patties.
# Sprinkle the remaining breading mix on the patties.
# Push the patties carefully on a spatula and fry them in a hot, oiled pan. If you use too much oil the patties will be soaked in fat, if you use too little the breading mix will not be fried. It's probably best to add a little bit of oil and then shuffle the patties around in the pan. The patties very quickly become robust enough so you can easily pick them up and turn them with a spatula to see if the other side had enough oil.
# You may want to
#* shake off loose breading mix over the plate, so as not to put loose breading mix into the pan. 
#* topple the patties into the pan.
#* flatten the patties a bit with the spatula, so the breading mix on the underside touches the oiled pan everywhere.

==Quotes Concerning The Holy Spirit==
:''As though he had said, Think not, my dear disciples, that I leave you out of anger: no, it is for your sakes, for your profit, that I go away: for if I go not away, if I die not upon the cross for your sins, and rise again for your justification, and ascend into heaven to make intercession, and plead my merits before my Father's throne; the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, will not, cannot come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And that they might know what he was to do, &quot;When he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment (John 16: 8).&quot; The person referred to in the words of the text, is plainly the Comforter, the Holy Ghost; and the promise was first made to our Lord's apostles. But though it was primarily made to them, and was literally and remarkably fulfilled at the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost came down as a mighty rushing wind, and also when three thousand were pricked to the heart by Peter's preaching; yet, as the Apostles were the representatives of the whole body of believers, we must infer, that this promise must be looked upon as spoken to us, and to our children, and to as many as the Lord our God shall call.''
::::::::::::::::::&amp;#8722; George Whitefield, Sermon 40.

==The Person of The Holy Spirit==
The Bible relates many attributes of the Holy Spirit.
* The Spirit is God. (Acts 5: 3-5)
* The Spirit is all knowing. (1 Cor 2: 10-11)
* The Spirit is eternal. (Heb. 9: 14)
* The Spirit is manifest by the sound of a blast of wind. (Acts 2: 2)
* The Spirit is accompanied by the appearance of tongues of fire:
::As poured out on the first church at Pentecost. (Acts 2: 3)
* The Spirit is assigned equal status with the Father and the Son:
::In the Great Commission (Matt. 28: 19)
::In blessings (2 Cor. 13: 14)
::In divine oneness. (1 John 5: 7)
* The Spirit was active in the life of Jesus:
::In His birth (Luke 1: 35)
::In His ministry (Luke 4: 18, Acts 10: 38)
::In directing Him (Matt. 4: 1)
::In His crucifixion (Heb. 9: 14)
::In the resurrection. (Rom. 8: 11)
*The Spirit gave specific instructions to the early Church:
::To ordain Barnabas and Saul (Acts 13: 2)
::Forbade Paul to go to Asia (Acts 16: 6)
::Foretold what would happen to Paul (Acts 20: 23, 21: 11)
::In letters to the seven churches in Asia. (Rev. 1, 2, 3)

==The Work Of The Holy Spirit==

The Holy Spirit was given to move on the unbeliever and to comfort the believer.

*The Holy Spirit works with the unbeliever:
::Regenerates the sinner. (John 3: 5)
::The Spirit brings conviction to the souls of those lost in sin. (John 16: 9)
::Convinces men and women that Jesus is the Son of God and can be their Savior. (John 16: 10)
::Shows men and women that the power of Satan is broken by Jesus in His death on the cross. (John 16: 11)

*The Holy Spirit works with the believer:
::Comforts and assures believers of their salvation. (Rom. 8: 16)
::Teaches and leads into all truth. (John 16: 13, 1 John 2: 27)
::Empowers believers to witness. (Acts 1: 8)
::Fills the believer’s mouth with Spirit-filled words in the time of need. (Luke 12: 12)
::Gives the  believer direction. (Rom. 8: 14)
::Helps the believer live above lusts of the lower nature. (Gal. 5: 16)
::Seals the believer with the promise that God is in control of the Spirit-filled life. (Eph. 1: 13,14)
::Gives and administers gifts to the Church. (1 Cor. 12: 7)
::The Spirit affirms that Jesus is the LORD God. (1 Cor. 12: 3)
::The Spirit joins with the Church in inviting the lost and disconsolate to Jesus Christ. (Rev. 22: 17)

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{C sharp/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
'''[[w:C_Sharp_(programming_language)|C#]]''' (pronounced &quot;See Sharp&quot;) is a multi-purpose computer [[w:programming language|programming language]] suitable for all development needs.

==Introduction==
Although C# is derived from the [[w:C programming language|C programming language]], it has features such as [[w:Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] that allow beginners to become proficient in C# more quickly than in [[Programming:C|C]] or [[Programming:C plus plus|C++]]. Similar to [[w:Java programming language|Java]], it is [[w:object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], comes with an extensive ''class library'', and supports exception handling, multiple types of [[w:polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], and separation of interfaces from implementations. Those features, combined with its powerful development tools, multi-platform support, and ''generics'', make C# a good choice for many types of software development projects: [[w:Rapid application development|rapid application development]] projects, projects implemented by individuals or large or small teams, Internet applications, and projects with strict reliability requirements. Testing frameworks such as [[w:NUnit|NUnit]] make C# amenable to [[w:test-driven development|test-driven development]] and thus a good language for use with [[w:Extreme Programming|Extreme Programming]] (XP). Its [[w:Strongly-typed programming language|strong typing]] helps to prevent many programming errors that are common in weakly typed languages. Because of these similarities to other languages, it is possible to introduce C# as a language with features of C++ having the programming style of Java and the rapid application model of BASIC.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| url        = http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/4300/Quick-C}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A large part of the power of C# (as with other .NET languages), comes with the common .NET Framework API, which provides a large set of classes, including ones for encryption, TCP/IP socket programming, and graphics. Developers can thus write part of an application in C# and another part in another .NET language (e.g. VB.NET), keeping the tools, library, and object-oriented development model while only having to learn the new language syntax.

Because of the similarities between C# and the C family of languages, as well as [[w:Java programming language|Java]], a developer with a background in object-oriented languages like C++ may find C# structure and syntax intuitive.

==Standard==
{{Wikipedia|C Sharp (programming language)}}
[[w:Microsoft|Microsoft]], with [[w:Anders Hejlsberg|Anders Hejlsberg]] as Chief Engineer, created C# as part of their [[w:Microsoft .Net|.NET]] initiative and subsequently opened its [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm specification] via the [[w:ECMA International|ECMA]]. Thus, the language is open to implementation by other parties. Other implementations include [[w:Mono development platform|Mono]] and [[w:DotGNU|DotGNU]].

C# and other .NET languages rely on an implementation of the [[w:virtual machine|virtual machine]] specified in the [[w:Common Language Infrastructure|Common Language Infrastructure]], like Microsoft's ''[[w:Common Language Runtime|Common Language Runtime]]'' (CLR). That virtual machine manages memory, handles object references, and performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compiling of [[w:Common Intermediate Language|Common Intermediate Language]] code. The virtual machine makes C# programs safer than those that must manage their own memory and is one of the reasons .NET language code is referred to as ''managed code''. More like Java than C and C++, C# discourages explicit use of pointers, which could otherwise allow software bugs to corrupt system memory and force the operating system to halt the program forcibly with nondescript error messages.

== History == 

Microsoft's original plan was to create a rival to Java, named J++, but this was abandoned to create C#, codenamed &quot;Cool&quot;. 

Microsoft submitted C# to the ECMA standards group mid-2000.

C# 2.0 was released in late-2005 as part of Microsoft's development suite, Visual Studio 2005. The 2.0 version of C# includes such new features as generics, partial classes, and iterators.&lt;ref&gt;

Hello Athgorn... have you noticed that:

ie:
[[Programming:C plus plus/Source File|Next Section: Source File Organization]]

similar sections on your last edits are breaking the single page version of the book, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:C_plus_plus:All_Chapters  ?

Can you fix it or is there a way of providing the same functionality without altering the All Chapters structure ?

Txs... I'll reply to you comments on the CPP talk page later in the day, txs for the help...
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:17, 22 December 2005 (UTC)

Ok, I've removed the changes that created problems to the All_Chapters version, a solution that could use the same idea can probably be found in using a template or something on those lines, for example the go back part only is shown on the by chapter navigation, wikibooks (wikimedia) hides that information on the full version of the book...&lt;br&gt;
If you have the time and disposition that would be a great idea so to facilitate navigation but by using a similar solution one should keep the order of the chapter virtual so future re-orders doesn't force an edit of all the parts (this bit can difficult it not impossible)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:36, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Athgorn. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Athgorn~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Help:Development stages|Development stages]] is a great idea, but it is patent that in its current implementation the status of a book is replicated in several places, at least in the Main Page templates and on the Bookshelves. If this status were centralized we could remove this redundancy improving the maintainability of Wikibooks. Once this is done, we could start displaying the development status of a book every where we want.

This problem has already been resolved in the Spanish Wikibooks (aka Wikilibros) where we have two templates, [[:es:Template:Libro2]] and [[:es:Template:Libro]], which are used to link to a book and display to its right the development icon. This templates as you can see, uses transclusion for centralizing the development status of each book.

I have created this template for implementing this feature here in English Wikibooks: [[Template:Book link]]. There is a default parameter for the link text, by the default is the book name, but can be set to a different value.

I have implemented a difference with the current system used in Wikilibros, the page centralizing the development status is not in the main namespace, but in the template one. I think this solution is better for avoiding conflicts with chapters named '''Sample Book/Development''' as might happen in Wikilibros.

I have made some tests for [[Ada Programming]].
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{book link|Ada Programming}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{book link|Ada Programming}}
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{book link|Ada Programming|Ada}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{book link|Ada Programming|Ada}}</text>

[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Calculus/Vectors Vectors], Chapter 1.1 - 1.7

==Scalars and Vectors and force==

===Scalar===

A scalar is a quantity possessing only a magnitude.  Examples include mass, volume, and length.  In this book, scalars are represented by letters in italic type: &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  Scalar quantities may be manipulated following the rules of simple algebra.

===Vector===

A vector is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction.  Examples include velocity, position, and force.  In this book, vectors are represented by letters with arrows over them: &lt;math&gt;\vec A&lt;/math&gt;.  Vector quantities are manipulated using vector mathematics, which is described in some detail in the following section.

==Examples of Vector vs. Scalar Quantities==

===Velocity vs. Speed===

Consider a car traveling South at a speed of 110 km per hour.  

We can describe the motion of the car as a velocity with a magnitude of 110 km per hour and a direction of south.  The velocity is a vector because it indicates magnitude and direction.

The motion of the car could also be described as a scalar by saying the speed is 110km per hour and ignoring the direction.  Speed is a scalar because it consists of only a magnitude.

==Force==

An applied force is a vector quantity having both a magnitude and a direction.  

Consider a hot air balloon suspended over a farmer's field at a constant altitude.  The bouyant force on the ballon pushes the balloon up.  At the same time, gravity exerts a force on the balloon pulling the balloon down. 

The bouyant force and the force due to gravity act in opposite directions.  If they have the same magnitude, the balloon will remain suspended at the same altitude.  If the bouyant force is greater than the force due to gravity, the balloon will rise.  If the force due to gravity is greater than the bouyant force, than the balloon will fall.

==Vector Representation (Two Dimensions)==

Forces, and any other vector, may be represented in a number of ways.

===Graphically===

A vector may be represented graphically by an arrow.  The magnitude of the vector corresponds to the length of the arrow, and the direction of the vector corresponds to the angle between the arrow and a coordinate axis.  The sense of the direction is indicated by the arrowhead. But when a vector changes direction the unit will change 10x

===Polar Notation===

In polar notation, the vector is represented by the magnitude of the vector, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and its angle from the coordinate axis, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in the form:

&lt;math&gt;\vec A=r\angle\theta&lt;/math&gt; 

or 

&lt;math&gt;\vec A=(r, \theta)&lt;/math&gt;

===Component Notation===

In component notation, a vector is represented by the magnitude of the components of the vector along the coordinate axes.  

====Scalar Notation====

The components of the vector are represented as scalar values which are positive if their sense is in the same direction as the coordinate axis, and negative if their sense is opposite of the coordinate axis.  For a vector with a positive ''x''-component and a negative ''y''-component:

&lt;math&gt;\vec A = A_x + (-A_y) = A_x - A_y&lt;/math&gt;

====Cartesian Notation====

The components of the vector are represented as positive scalar values multiplied by cartesian unit vectors.  Cartesian unit vectors are vectors with a magnitude of one that represent the direction of the coordinate axes.  The unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{i}&lt;/math&gt; represents the ''x''-axis, and the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{j}&lt;/math&gt; represents the ''y''-axis.  The vectors sense is indicated by the sign of the unit vector.  For a vector with a positive ''x''-component and a negative ''y''-component:

&lt;math&gt;\vec A = A_x\hat{i} + A_y(-\hat{j}) = A_x\hat{i} - A_y\hat{j}&lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt;\vec A = \langle A_x, -A_y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

==Forces as Vectors==

In engineering statics, we often convert forces into to component notation.  Replacing a force with its components makes it easier to compute the resultant of a group of forces acting on a body.  Conversion of a force from polar to component notation is accomplished by the following transformations:


For force &lt;math&gt;\vec F = F\angle\alpha = F_x + F_y&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;F_x \ = F \cos \alpha&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_y \ = F \sin \alpha&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;F \ = \sqrt{F_x^2+F_y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\alpha \ = \arctan \frac{F_y}{F_x}&lt;/math&gt;


===Example 1===


[[image:StaticsEx130.svg|thumb|The graph to the left shows the 30 degree force, the plot to the right shows how the 30 degree force can be separated into X and Y components]]

Consider a force, &lt;math&gt;\vec F&lt;/math&gt;, with a magnitude, &lt;math&gt; F&lt;/math&gt;, of 100 N acting in the ''x-y'' plane.  This force acts at an angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, of 30 degrees to ''x''-axis.  What is this force in component notation?

We can replace this force with a pair of forces acting along the ''x''-axis and the ''y''-axis as follows.

&lt;math&gt;F_x = F \cos \alpha = 100 cos(30) \ = 86.6 N&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F_y = F \sin \alpha = 100 sin(30) \ = 50.0 N&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 2===

Two forces acting in the ''x-y'' plane are acting on a point.  The first force is 100 N at an angle of 0 degrees.  The second force is 50 N acting at an angle of 60 degrees.  What is the resultant?



First, resolve the forces into their ''x'' and ''y'' components.
 
&lt;math&gt; F_{1x} = F_1 \cos (A) \ = 100 cos(0) = 100 &lt;/math&gt;
 
&lt;math&gt; F_{1y} = F_1 \sin (A) \ = 100 sin(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
 
&lt;math&gt; F_{2x} = F_2 \cos (B) \ = 50 cos(60) = 25 &lt;/math&gt;
 
&lt;math&gt; F_{2y} = F_2 \sin (B) \ = 50 sin(60) = 43.3&lt;/math&gt;

 
Sum all the forces in the ''x''-direction.
 
&lt;math&gt; F_x = F_{1x} + F_{2x} \ = 100 + 25 = 125 &lt;/math&gt;

 
Sum all the forces in the ''y''-direction.
 
&lt;math&gt; F_y = F_{1y} + F_{2y} \ = 0 + 43.3 = 43.3 &lt;/math&gt;

 
Finally, convert the resultant components back into polar notation.
 
&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{ \left ( \vert F_x \vert ^2 + \vert F_y \vert ^2 \right )} = 132.3 &lt;/math&gt;
 
&lt;math&gt; \theta\ = \arctan \left ( \frac{F_y}{F_x} \right ) = 19.1^\circ &lt;/math&gt;

 
The resultant force is 132.3 N at an angle of 19.1 degrees.

== Overview ==

'''''Ronan''''' is a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaur]] living in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. He has a slow, doleful voice.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is serving his detention in the Forbidden Forest, he, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] hear something moving. Challenged, the something moving turns out to be Ronan, a Centaur, who discusses astronomy (&quot;Mars is very bright tonight&quot;).

Later, when Harry has encountered the being that is killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|Unicorns]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]], another Centaur, rescues him, and offers to carry him back to Hagrid. As he is doing so, Ronan (along with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bane|Bane]], another centaur), confront Firenze. Bane is infuriated that Firenze is acting as a beast of burden, while Ronan says dolefully that he is sure Firenze is doing what he thinks best.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Ronan is one of the centaurs who confront [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] in the Forbidden Forest when Hermione is leading her (and Harry) to the supposed weapon they claim to have been working on. After Umbridge is spirited away, and the others are trying to decide what to do with Harry and Hermione, Ronan reminds the others that they do not attack foals.

== Overview ==

'''''Felix Felicis''''' is a potion that makes its drinker &quot;lucky&quot; or brings more good fortune than usual.  It is the color of molten gold.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Felix Felicis is a very complicated potion to brew, normally taking six months or more. Somehow, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] has some available for the first N.E.W.T.-level [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions class]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|sixth year]], despite his having been hired less than two months before school started, and having arrived at Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express less than a week before. The use of this potion is forbidden before Quidditch matches, academic tests, or any other kind of competition, because it constitutes an unfair advantage. Professor Slughorn offers a small amount of this potion as a prize to whoever brews the best potion in his first class; Harry wins this by following the marginal instructions in his second-hand Potions book.

Harry pretends to put some of this potion in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s pumpkin juice at breakfast before the first Quidditch match of Harry's sixth year; the confidence this gives Ron is enough to allow him to goalkeep well, where he had been suffering a bit of a crisis of confidence earlier.

Harry uses the potion on himself when he is attempting to retrieve a memory from Professor Slughorn at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]]'s request. The potion makes him act in a way that would seem to an impartial observer to be irrational; the end result, however, is that he succeeds in getting the memory, which Slughorn has been withholding. A side effect is that he manages to break up the relationships between Ron and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]], much to Ron's benefit, and between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dean Thomas|Dean Thomas]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]], much to his own benefit.

The remainder of the potion is shared between members of Dumbledore's Army, who are acting to defend Hogwarts in the battle at the end of book 6. The potion does seem to prevent their receiving any injury.

== Analysis ==

The mechanism at work with Felix Felicis is never explained, though it is perhaps reasonable to consider it an extension of the old concept of &quot;making one's own luck.&quot;  When Harry uses this potion he experiences a feeling of unlimited possibility.  Under its influence Harry was nudged and guided to make certain inexplicable decisions that eventually lead to his success.  Only a step or two at a time was made apparent, characterized more as whims rather than logical instructions; and Harry rightly referred to these as decisions made by the potion, rather than by himself.

There is an apparent belief on the part of Muggles that potions, like medicines, can only affect the person who takes them; while there is, quite possibly, some truth to this, Felix Felicis seems initially to act counter to this, taking Harry to places where he would never go of his own accord, and apparently impelling people to meet with Harry at Harry's pleasure. On close examination, however, we can see that Harry is, in fact, simply supernaturally good at picking up outside cues, and acting on them, while under the influence of Felix Felicis. Harry knows that it is twilight, and probably subconsciously knows of the phases of the moon, and so may guess, without realizing it, that Slughorn will be at the greenhouses collecting potion ingredients just then; he may also have somehow perceived Slughorn from his dormitory window. That one apparent coincidence, Harry's choosing to visit Hagrid by way of the greenhouses and somehow managing to meet Slughorn there, would seem to be the only inexplicable event in Harry's travels that evening. All else that befalls Harry can easily be seen as originating from within Harry himself. It is worth noting that Harry had earlier considered using Felix Felicis to try and get Ginny Weasley as his girlfriend and find a better match for Ron than Lavender Brown, so it is unsurprising that, consciously or otherwise, he engineered the breakup of Ginny and Dean, and of Lavender and Ron, while under the influence of Felix Felicis.

== Overview ==

A '''''Love Potion''''' is a potion that makes the drinker &quot;fall in love&quot;. Generally these potions are somehow &quot;keyed&quot; to an individual; the person who imbibes the potion will fall in love with a specific individual, usually the one who prepared (or at least performed the final steps in preparing) the potion.

== Extended Description == 

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 9|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] states that you cannot truly create ''actual'' love, the only thing the potion brings is obsession or infatuation. Apparently, love potions are fairly common; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], for instance, are apparently doing a pretty brisk business selling them to the girls at Hogwarts.

== Analysis ==

Love potions do not figure particularly prominently in the story until ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''. Up until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|fourth year]], Harry and his classmates are too young to be overly concerned about such things. The sole mention comes from outside: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]], in writing about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|Witch Weekly]]'' during Harry's fourth year, quotes [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pansy Parkinson|Pansy Parkinson]] as suggesting that Hermione may be using love potion to keep both Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] on a string.

The conflict between the Champions in the fourth book, and the Ministry campaign against Harry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|his fifth year]], make him not a particularly desirable &quot;catch&quot;, so love potions are not something that anyone in the story has need of. By the beginning of Harry's sixth year, though, with the Ministry electing to blow up Harry's significance and make him &quot;The Chosen One&quot;, several girls, most noticeably [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Romilda Vane|Romilda Vane]], are scheming and conniving to get hooked up with him; and love potions end up being a big part of that. The first solid mention of a love potion is the ''Amortentia potion'', shown by Professor Slughorn by way of example in his first [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] class, and identified by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]].

In the days preceding Professor Slughorn's Christmas party, Hermione hears several girls scheming about ways to slip Harry a love potion, and warns him. As a result of this, he turns down an offer from Romilda Vane to share a Gillywater, but does accept a box of chocolate cauldrons with Firewhisky centres, which he carefully sets aside, expecting them to be spiked with more than alcohol. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] discovers them on his birthday, some months later, and assumes that they are a birthday present for him; he, of course, promptly becomes infatuated with Romilda, completely forgetting about his current entanglement with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender]]. Professor Slughorn is able to cure him of this infatuation in short order.

One other use of Love Potion mentioned in this same book is the use of it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle Sr.|Tom Riddle]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Voldemort's mother]]. After using the potion for a while, she incorrectly believes that Riddle Sr. is truly in love with her, and discontinues the potion; he, feeling betrayed, abandons the now-pregnant Merope and returns to his family home.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
# We never see a Love Potion brewed in the series. What would be some possible ingredients?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The two times we see Love Potions being used, they are very specific in their effects: the potion used to spike the Chocolate Cauldrons, as mentioned, gave Ron an instant infatuation with Romilda Vane, and the potion we believe Merope Gaunt used on Tom Riddle Sr. similarly had Merope as the object of desire. This would seem to be incompatible with the Twins selling love potions by owl post; how could the Twins know who the love potion was supposed to be causing infatuation for? This begins to make a little more sense when we think back on the brewing of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]]: the potion was not complete until some hair (or presumably fingernails, toenails, or other &quot;shed&quot; matter) was added to it. What the Twins presumably shipped would be incomplete; the recipient would have to then finish it by adding something to identify the target of affection. So for instance Romilda could have received potion from the Weasleys, added a bit of her own hair to it to aim it at herself, and then used it to spike the Gillywater that she offered Harry, and the Chocolate Cauldrons that she gave him.

Alternately, when ordering a love potion, the order form may require you to include a lock of hair. But that could cause serious headaches for the Twins if hairs got mixed up. We can imagine Romilda's fury if the potion she had ordered made Harry infatuated with, say, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lavender Brown|Lavender Brown]]... We won't speculate on the sort of practical jokes that could be caused by creating a love potion that would cause two very inappropriate people to become infatuated with each other, except to suggest that the only reason the Twins aren't seen to be doing this is likely because this is a book series meant for children.

The Amortentia potion that we see in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' is presumably unfinished, needing only a lock of hair, or equivalent, to make it effective.

== Overview ==

The '''''Pensieve''''' is primarily a device for storing memories outside of one's own head.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Pensieve has multiple functions.

At times, when one's head is so full of thoughts that one cannot hear oneself think, it is useful to be able to take some of those thoughts and literally set them aside. The practiced Wizard can extract a thought from his head and store it in a phial or in the Pensieve for another time. If it is in the Pensieve, it is possible to stir the thoughts stored there together and look for patterns. It appears that the wizard has the choice of extracting an entire memory, leaving no trace of it in his head, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] does in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], or extracting a copy of a memory, retaining the original, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] does in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. It is also apparently possible to edit these extracted memories, though it is a difficult task and one which is often not done well.

If one places one's head within the Pensieve, one becomes immersed in a memory that is stored in the Pensieve, and is able to relive it as if one was living that time over again. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] experienced [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore's]] memories of the Wizengamot trials of several [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] this way in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], and Professor Snape's memories of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/James Potter|Harry's father]] in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''.

A thought or memory stored in the Pensieve can, with proper stimulus, appear to nearby viewers as if standing on the surface of the basin. Professor Dumbledore used this technique to show Harry the prophecy that had been made about him, in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', and it is used in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' when full immersion in memory was not needed.

It is also possible to take another person's memories, place them in the Pensieve, and then enter them to relive them as if one were the person whose memories you have just added to the Pensieve. Harry and Professor Dumbledore do this a number of times in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' in order to determine the salient points of the early history of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle]], or as he later styled himself, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]].

== Analysis ==

Most interestingly, the memories viewed by the person watching in the Pensieve are more complete than the person's own observations. For instance, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bob Ogden|Bob Ogden]] visits the Gaunt family. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin]] speaks to him only in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|Parseltongue]], which Ogden does not know and so would not be able to remember properly; yet Harry, reliving Ogden's memories, not only understands what the Gaunts are saying in Parseltongue, he is able to perceive things happening outside Ogden's range of vision.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', a number of times we are privileged to see the memories of wizards long dead – [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin Gaunt]] and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/House Elf|house-elf]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hokey|Hokey]], to give two examples. From this, we can be certain that extracted memories, if preserved in vials, live on past the death of their owners. Dumbledore's Pensieve, whenever we see it, is swimming with memories that Dumbledore has set aside; we never do find out if Dumbledore's memories in the Pensieve survive his death. If they did survive, it would seem extremely likely that Harry would have need to consult these memories in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], but the situation does not arise. He does use the Pensieve, however, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|to review]] the memories of another dead wizard, namely Snape.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Newton's First Law==
Newton's first law states that an object that remains in uniform motion will remain in uniform motion unless it is acted upon by an external force.  This also includes that an object at rest will remain at rest unless it is acted upon by an external force. When more than one force acts upon an object, the vector sum of these forces is the '''resultant force'''.

When the resultant force on an object is zero, it will remain at rest if it is at rest, or continue to move in a straight line at a constant velocity if it is in motion.  There is no change in either the magnitude or direction of its velocity.  That is, there is zero acceleration. This concept can also be applied to motion in any selected direction.

Consider an object moving along the x-axis.  If no net force is applied to the object along the x-axis, it will continue to move along the x-axis at a constant velocity with no acceleration.We can extend this to the y- and z- axes.

In any system, unless the applied forces cancel each other out, that is, the resultant force is zero, there will be acceleration in the direction of the resultant force.
==Force Equilibrium==
In static systems, where motion does not occur, the sum of the forces in all directions must always equal zero (otherwise, it's a dynamics problem).  This concept can be represented mathematically with the following equations.

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum F_z = 0&lt;/math&gt;


==Rotational Equilibrium==
The concept also applies to rotational motion.

If the resultant moment about an axis is zero, the object will have no rotational acceleration about the axis.  If the object is not spinning, it will not start to spin.  If the object is spinning, it will continue to spin at the same constant angular velocity.  Again, we can extend this to moments about the y-axis and the z-axis.  This is represented mathematically with the following.

&lt;math&gt;\sum M_x = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum M_y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum M_z = 0&lt;/math&gt;

==What happens if the sum of forces or moments is not zero?==
If the object has a net moment not equal to zero, it will spin about whichever axes are not zero.  If the object is acted upon by a net force not equal to zero, it will accelerate in whatever direction the net force is.  Once the object moves it cannot be analyzed with statics, instead the rules of dynamics take control.  The acceleration of the object is governed by Newton's second law, 

&lt;math&gt;\sum F = m \cdot a &lt;/math&gt;

You will never need this equation in Statics.

== Recategorised, note on naming and TOC ==

Hi,

I recategorised the pages of this book from the (very large) [[:Category:Engineering]] to [[:Category:Statics]], which is now a subcategory of Engineering.

Just a note: since you're using colon naming, it's a good idea to make sure you put the TOC template on all pages (I didn't notice you had it on some pages until 1/2 way through). Colons are supposed to be disallowed by the current naming ploicy, but I plan to bring that to debate: see [[Wikibooks talk:Naming policy]] for details. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:11, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

== Expanding Book ==

Hi,
I was interested in working on expanding and formating this wikibook considerably in the near future.  I was wondering if there were any objections, thoughts, or comments on the matter.

== Why this? Why here? ==

There may be something on Meta like this as well.  Who cares?  I'm doing this mainly for new admins on Wikibooks, but I would like to make this generic for all Wikimedia admins as well.  Feel free to jump in and help out with this.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:21, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

:Where is it... [[m:Help:Contents]]... [[m:Help:System admin]]... no, that is for users who edit php files... [[m:Help:Editor]]... [[m:Help:Reverting]]... &quot;Admin-only &quot;rollback&quot; link&quot;... I guess that there is no separate section of Meta for admins/sysops.

:&lt;small&gt;&lt;complain&gt;The current [[m:Help:Contents|MediaWiki Handbook]] is a mess. Officially, this book is one-to-one with the &quot;Help:&quot; namespace at Meta, and each page can be copied to each Wikimedia project, but when I was copying [[Help:Introduction]] earlier today, I had several problems with broken and obsolete links on [[m:Help:Introduction]] which I tried to fix. Not only is there an entire set of deprecated pages under [[m:Documentation]], but several pages (linked from [[m:Help:Hacker]] for example) are not in the &quot;Help:&quot; namespace. Further there were some red links that I changed to point to English Wikipedia; I also found stubs of encyclopedia articles at Meta. As for the content, some modules are outdated; the other modules document every obscure feature of MediaWiki 1.6devel without explaining them well.&lt;/complain&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:A book that explains how to be an admin/sysop, and without all those confusing templates at Meta, is a good idea. I will not contribute much, but if the book becomes more generic (to include [[UseMod:UseModWiki|UseModWiki]] for example), then I might contribute, or maybe I will contribute to [[Wiki Science]]. Meanwhile, I might also try to fix the MediaWiki Handbook. Actually, I am not sure what I plan to do. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:22, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

== Meta Source Material ==

This is another area where perhaps having a separate Wikibook on the subject is going to help clear up a mess on Meta as well.  The key sources for assisting Admins (sysop status) on MediaWiki projects is not [[m:Help:System admin]] but rather [[m:Help:Moderator]], as what on Wikimedia projects we call Admins are really moderators from the double speak that takes place on the meta pages.  What the MediaWiki handbook calls administrators is really developers, or people who have direct access to the computers that are running MediaWiki software.  Admins on Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects don't have that level of access (unless they are working to become a developer).  There are some gems in some other pages of the MediaWiki handbook that may be useful for admins, but it takes time to sort through all of the extra material to find it, as the MediaWiki handbook in those sections is geared more toward the developers and people running their own MediaWiki server.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:40, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

==Rename to MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook?==
I think the book should be renamed. Many non-Foundation sites use MediaWiki now and a good portion of the info (deleting, banning, etc. etc.) would be just as applicable to them as to us. Of course there could still be Foundation-exclusive pages like explaining Vfd and whatnot. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:51, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

:I'm not tied to this particular name myself.  There are some unique aspects of the Wikimedia culture that do need explaining to the non-initiated, but most of that can be translated to other projects as well.  It is also something that other projects could learn from as well, especially when dealing with larger projects.  Attempting to be a moderating force in a collaborative writing environment is an interesting community role to play, and where the true strength of being an admin really comes into play.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:58, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

== Moving this book to the Help namespace ==

This was a stealth move when a bunch of other stuff was happening.  I don't think this belongs in the help namespace, although that can be up to debate.  I originally wrote this as a '''''book''''' that would be a conventional Wikibook, even though the emphasis is indeed to be of assistance to sysops of MediaWiki projects.

Given no major objection for a couple of weeks, I'm going to revert the book name back to the main namespace and out of the help namespace.  This is a conventional Wikibook, and I hope that people contribute to it as such.  It was never my intention to make this a Wikibooks-specific manual.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:47, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

== How to differentiate each target audience for each MediaWiki reference manual:&lt;br&gt;Developer, Sysop, Admin, Editor, User ==

''Peter Blaise says:'' I think there is poor identification and differentiation of who uses and who works in, on, around, and under a wiki.  Rather than just duplicating existing resources, I suggest we brainstorm and come up with something new.  I suggest a functional analysis - how each user / worker functions, what they do, and how they do it.  Here are a few overlapping levels of users / workers as I experience Mediawiki installations, in order here from top (customer / end user) down to the penultimate service provider, the original coder.  I find that I'm dividing my time and paying attention to three areas in my Mediawiki installations:

:; Content - User, Editor, Admin.
:: Here I see Users, Editors and Admins dealing with Articles, Discussion / Talk pages, and Categories.
::: Read and print content.
::: Contribute content.
::: Edit and manage content.
::: Manage Users, Editors, Admins.
::: Browser-level access to site controls.

:; Function - Admin, Sysop.
:: Here I see Admins and Sysops dealing with all the on-screen controls and what those controls do, and the underlying programs.
::: All of the above.
::: Access under the web browser.
::: Install, configure, update.
::: Operating System level tasks.

:; Structure - Sysop, Developer.
:: Here I see Admins, Sysops and Developers going behind the scenes, underneath the user interface, installing, configuring, updating, using the Operating System and other tools, and creating, finding, and installing enhancements.
::: Creates and modifies core software and extensions.
::: programmer
::: needs overview and details of programming.
::: installs, configures, 
::: needs software choices and code information, 
::: has access to &quot;layers&quot; below HTML, such as operating system and code edits.

I have no problem with one manual for all three - there just needs to be three levels of depth.  Writing three or more separate manuals seems silly to me since each subsequent level of depth needs the previous level of information.  I'll create a simple example:

I can't imagine a Developer wanting a reference manual showing &quot;navigation&quot; menu programming controls without also at least explaining what the &quot;navigation&quot; menu is and how it functions, as well as how to modify it with built-in controls, without the need for programming unless they want to go beyond that.  Also, as an &quot;Function and Structure&quot; Admin, I appreciate more than just changing the &quot;navigation&quot; menu with available tools, but also customizing it or adding programming-like items to it, as well as understanding where I may need to go if I want more, including a tease or invitation to &quot;do it yourself&quot; and dabble in Development.  

In other words, I see no benefit to separate manuals, and I see all the benefits to having one, complete, all-inclusive Mediawiki reference manual.  The challenge may be to easily make the depth of displayed information tunable so I can toggle or nicely enter / exit successive depths if I'm curious, and come back without getting lost.

Otherwise, I might as well just go to Google each time I need to look something up and let Google dynamically assemble my Mediawiki manual each day for me whenever I'm ready for more.

Does this make sense to anyone else?  How could we accomplish this?  Is there, or can we make, MediaWiki extensions that help structure a reference manual on a wiki - table of contents, page navigation controls back and forth with bookmarks to return to the same page and post it notes to highlight our discoveries, and an encyclopedic index to help us look up definitions, not just search-results listing every time the word is used?  I look at [[Special:Version]] and I see no &quot;book&quot; publishing extensions here yet.  Why is that?  [[User:Peterblaise|peterblaise]] 15:33, 21 September 2007 (UTC)

:This is exactly how we should be dividing these books up. The other consideration is whether the book is written to be specific to Wikibooks, MediaWiki wikis in general, Wikipedia, Wikimedia projects in general etc. I've left some comments on various talk pages in this set of texts about some small-scale re-organization, but more is needed. I have some notes written down - I'll perhaps put them up somewhere to better coordinate things. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:48, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

== Deleting a User ==

Hello...&lt;br&gt;
Can anybody tell me please, how i can DELETE an allready registered User? 

Thanx for your help&lt;br&gt;

You can't. The technical reason behind this is that then revisions attributed to that user would break. You can use an extension to re-attribute changes to a new user, though.
:You actually can, but it's a very bad idea. [[mw:Extension:RenameUser]] is a safer alternative. You can try [[mw:Extension:DeleteAndMerge]] if you're adventurous. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:46, 29 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Original comment ==
This book seems pretty dead, which is unfortunate.  I fixed some spelling errors anonymously, before realizing the lack of content.  I have now created an account and intend on add some content myself; I've done some N+ studying and saved my notes.  I don't actually have the certification yet, because I haven't finished everything, so I can't promise a completed text for a while. ;)  -WMD (2:20am EST, 12/22)

== Second comment ==
I would have to vote against combining this page with the Network Plus Certification book.  That book has significantly more detail than is necessary for a cram. [[User:Bjadter|Bjadter]] ([[User talk:Bjadter|talk]]) 22:59, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

== Additional Resources ==
I added titles to each of the comments, in order to cause a nice Table Of Contents on this discussion page.
I don't understand Bjadter's comment (the second comment).  This page is considered to be part of the Network Plus certification Wikibook.  What combining would be needed?  And who is saying that cramming is desired?
Anyway, if anyone wants another resource, I've made one at [http://cyberpillar.com/dirsver/1/mainsite/techns/induscer/comptia/netwkpls/n10005/ctianpl5.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;[CyberPillar&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;[ guide to CompTIA Network+ N10-005].
and I would be happy to discuss plans to improve that guide or this one.  I presume that the comment, which I labelled as &quot;Original comment&quot;, predates the second comment which appears to be from the year 2008.
Also, There are other resources that I think could be helpful, like [http://cyberpillar.com/dirsver/1/mainsite/techns/basics/netbasic/subnet/vlsmchrt/vlsmchrt.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;[CyberPillar&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;[\s VLSM chart].

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would posit that some enantiomers are not configurational isomers because they can be interconverted via bond rotation. BINAP and BINOL ligands, for example, can be converted from the R to the S enantiomer by rotation about the biphenyl bond. Remember that enantiomers are defined by a mirror-image relationship, and not a stereocenter-dependent relationship!--[[User:Lineweaver|Lineweaver]] 08:05, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{C sharp/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

As in other object-oriented programming languages, the functionality of a C# program is implemented in 
one or more '''classes'''. The ''methods'' and ''properties'' of a class contain the code that defines how the class behaves.

C# classes support [[w:en:information hiding|information hiding]] by [[C Sharp Programming/Encapsulation|encapsulating]] functionality in properties and methods and by enabling several types of [[w:en:polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]], including ''subtyping polymorphism'' via [[../Inheritance|inheritance]] and ''parametric polymorphism'' via [[w:en:generic programming|generics]].

Several types of C# classes can be defined, including ''instance'' classes (''standard'' classes that can be instantiated), ''static'' classes, and ''structures''.
 
Classes are defined using the keyword {{C sharp|class}} followed by an identifier to name the class. Instances of the class can then be created with the {{C sharp|new}} keyword followed by the name of the class.

The code below defines a class called {{C sharp|Employee}} with properties {{C sharp|Name}} and {{C sharp|Age}} and with empty methods {{C sharp|GetPayCheck()}} and {{C sharp|Work()}}. It also defines a {{C sharp|Sample}} class that instantiates and uses the {{C sharp|Employee}} class:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class Employee
{
    private int _Age;
    private string _Name;

    public int Age
    {
        get { return _Age; }
        set { _Age = value; }
    }

    public string Name
    {
        get { return _Name; }
        set { _Name = value; }
    }

    public void GetPayCheck()
    {
    }

    public void Work()
    {
    }
}

public class Sample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Employee marissa = new Employee();

        marissa.Work();
        marissa.GetPayCheck();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Methods==
C# ''methods'' are class members containing code. They may have a return value and a list of [[C Sharp Programming/Variables#Parameter|parameters]], as well as a ''generic'' type declaration. Like fields, methods can be ''static'' (associated with and accessed through the class) or ''instance'' (associated with and accessed through an object instance of the class
methods as well as a ''generic'' type declaration.

==Constructors of classes==
A class's ''constructors'' control its initialization. A constructor's code executes to initialize an instance of the class when a program requests a new object of the class's type. Constructors often set properties of their classes, but they are not restricted to doing so.

Like other methods, a constructor can have ''parameters''. To create an object using a constructor with parameters, the {{C sharp|new}} command accepts parameters. The code below defines and then instantiates multiple objects of the {{C sharp|Employee}} class, once using the constructor without parameters and once using the version with a parameter:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class Employee
{
    public Employee()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Constructed without parameters&quot;);
    }

    public Employee(string strText)
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(strText);
    }
}

public class Sample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Start&quot;);
        Employee Alfred = new Employee();
        Employee Billy  = new Employee(&quot;Parameter for construction&quot;);
        System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;End&quot;);
    }

&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
 Start
 Constructed without parameters
 Parameter for construction
 End

Constructors can call each other:

&lt;source lang=&quot;CSharp&quot;&gt;
public class Employee
{
    public Employee(string strText, int iNumber)
    {
        ...
    }
    
    public Employee(string strText)
        : this(strText, 1234) // calls the above constructor with user-specified text and the default number
    { }
    
    public Employee()
        : this(&quot;default text&quot;) // calls the above constructor with the default text
    { }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Finalizers (Destructors)== 
The opposite of constructors, ''finalizers'' define the final behavior of an object and execute when the object is no longer in use. Although they are often used in C++ to free resources reserved by an object, they are less frequently used in C# due to the .NET Framework Garbage Collector. An object's finalizer, which takes no parameters, is called sometime after an object is no longer referenced, but the complexities of garbage collection make the specific timing of finalizers uncertain.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class Employee
{
    public Employee(string strText)
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(strText);
    }

    ~Employee()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Finalized!&quot;);
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        Employee marissa = new Employee(&quot;Constructed!&quot;);

        marissa = null;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
 Constructed!
 Finalized!

==Properties==
C# ''properties'' are class members that expose functionality of methods using the syntax of ''fields''. They simplify the syntax of calling traditional ''get'' and ''set'' methods (a.k.a. ''accessor'' methods). Like methods, they can be ''static'' or ''instance''.

Properties are defined in the following way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class MyClass
{
    private int m_iField = 3; // Sets integerField with a default value of 3

    public int IntegerField
    {
        get
        {
            return m_iField;  // get returns the field you specify when this property is assigned
        }
        set
        {
            m_iField = value; // set assigns the value assigned to the property of the field you specify
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

An even shorter way for getter/setter methods are accessors that do both in one line:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
class Culture
{
    public int TalkedCountries { get; set; }
    public string Language { get; set; }
}

class InterculturalDialogue
{
    Culture culture;

    culture.Language = &quot;Italian&quot;;  // ==&gt; culture.SetLanguage(&quot;Italian&quot;);

    string strThisLanguage = culture.Language; // ==&gt; ... = culture.GetLanguage();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The code is equivalent to a GetLanguage and SetLanguage method definition, but without having to define these methods. The user can directly access the member, if it is not private, of course.

The C# keyword {{C sharp/kw|value}} contains the value assigned to the property. After a property is defined it can be used like a variable. If you were to write some additional code in the get and set portions of the property it would work like a method and allow you to manipulate the data before it is read or written to the variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class MyProgram
{
    MyClass myClass = new MyClass;

    Console.WriteLine(myClass.IntegerField); // Writes 3 to the command line.
    myClass.IntegerField = 7; // Indirectly assigns 7 to the field myClass.m_iField     
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Using properties in this way provides a clean, easy to use mechanism for protecting data.

==Indexers==
C# ''indexers'' are class members that define the behavior of the ''array access'' operation (e.g. {{C sharp|list[0]}} to access the first element of {{C sharp|list}} even when {{C sharp|list}} is not an array).

To create an indexer, use the '''this''' keyword as in the following example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public string this[string strKey]
{
    get { return coll[strKey]; }
    set { coll[strKey] = value; }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code will create a string indexer that returns a string value. For example, if the class was {{C sharp|EmployeeCollection}}, you could write code similar to the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
EmployeeCollection e = new EmployeeCollection();
.
.
.
string s = e[&quot;Jones&quot;];
e[&quot;Smith&quot;] = &quot;xxx&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Events==
C# ''events'' are class members that expose notifications to clients of the class. Events are only fired and never assigned.

&lt;source lang=&quot;CSharp&quot;&gt;
using System;

// Note: You need to know some about delegate, properties and methods to understand this sample
namespace EventSample
{
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// This delegate defines the signature of the appropriate method
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public delegate void ContractHandler(Employee sender);

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    ///     Employee class
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public class Employee
    {
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        ///     Field for the info whether or not the Employee is engaged
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        private bool bIsEngaged = false;
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        ///     Age of the employee

==Operator overloading==
C# {{C sharp|operator}} definitions are class members that define or redefine the behavior of basic C# operators (called implicitly or explicitly) on instances of the class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;CSharp&quot;&gt;
public class Complex
{
    private double m_dReal, m_dImaginary;
    
    public double Real
    {
        get { return m_dReal; }
        set { m_dReal = value; }
    }
    
    public double Imaginary
    {
        get { return m_dImaginary; }
        set { m_dImaginary = value; }
    }
    
    // binary operator overloading
    public static Complex operator +(Complex c1, Complex c2)
    {
        return new Complex() { Real = c1.Real + c2.Real, Imaginary = c1.Imaginary + c2.Imaginary };
    }
    
    // unary operator overloading
    public static Complex operator -(Complex c)
    {
        return new Complex() { Real = -c.Real, Imaginary = -c.Imaginary };
    }
    
    // cast operator overloading (both implicit and explicit)
    public static implicit operator double(Complex c)
    {
        // return the modulus - sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
        return Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(c.Real, 2) + Math.Pow(c.Imaginary, 2));
    }
    
    public static explicit operator string(Complex c)
    {
        // we should be overloading the ToString() method, but this is just a demonstration
        return c.Real.ToString() + &quot; + &quot; + c.Imaginary.ToString() + &quot;i&quot;;
    }
}

public class StaticDemo
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Complex number1 = new Complex() { Real = 1, Imaginary = 2 };
        Complex number2 = new Complex() { Real = 4, Imaginary = 10 };
        Complex number3 = number1 + number2; // number3 now has Real = 5, Imaginary = 12
        
        number3 = -number3; // number3 now has Real = -5, Imaginary = -12
        double testNumber = number3; // testNumber will be set to the absolute value of number3
        Console.WriteLine((string)number3); // This will print &quot;-5 + -12i&quot;.
        // The cast to string was needed because that was an explicit cast operator.
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Structures==
''Structures'', or ''structs'', are defined with the {{C sharp|struct}} keyword followed by an ''identifier'' to name the structure. They are similar to classes, but have subtle differences. ''Structs'' are used as lightweight versions of classes that can help reduce memory management efforts when working with small data structures. In most situations, however, using a standard ''class'' is a better choice.

The principal difference between ''structs'' and ''classes'' is that ''instances'' of ''structs'' are ''values'' whereas ''instances'' of ''classes'' are ''references''. Thus when you pass a ''struct'' to a function by value you get a copy of the object so changes to it are not reflected in the original because there are now two distinct objects but if you pass an instance of a class by reference then there is only one instance.

The {{C sharp|Employee}} structure below declares a {{C sharp|public}} and a {{C sharp|private}} field. Access to the {{C sharp|private}} field is granted through the {{C sharp|public}} [[C Sharp Programming/Encapsulation|property]] {{C sharp|Name}}:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
struct Employee
{
    public int m_iAge;
    private string m_strName;

    public string Name
    {
        get { return m_strName; }
        set { m_strName = value; }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Since C# 2.0, is possible to have [[C_Sharp_Programming/Variables#Arrays|arrays]] inside structures, but only in unsafe contexts:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
struct data
{
    int header;
    fixed int values[10];
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The array is accessed using pointer arithmetic. Values are treat arrayed values as if they were C-style arrays using indexing, etc.

===Structure constructors===
Structures need constructors - or better to say initialisers, as they do not construct but just initialise the memory&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| accessdate = 2012-04-12
| author     = Greg Beech
| date       = 2008-06-16
| location   = http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/
| page       = 
| publisher  = MSDN
| title      = Structure constructors
| quote      = Because structures are simply an inline area of memory, they cannot be null, and so the CLR has to be able to ensure that the area of memory is totally initialized rather than being partly garbage. For this reason, you'll often hear the 'constructors' on structures called (arguably more correctly) 'initializers' because the don't construct an object they just initialize an area of memory.
| url        = http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/eu/csharplanguage/thread/40085588-ccb0-42bf-8492-fa48f072b877}}
&lt;/ref&gt; - so that their contents are not left uninitialised. Therefore, constructors without parametres are not allowed.

Structure variables can be assigned one to another if and only if the structure variable on the right side of the assignment are all initialised.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| publisher  = Google Books
| title      = Microsoft® Visual C#® 2005 Step by Step / Copying Structure Variables
| quote      = You're allowed to initialize or assign one ''struct'' variable to another ''struct'' variable, but only if the ''struct'' variable on the right side is completely initalized (that is, if all its fields are initialized).

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
struct Timestamp
{
    private ushort m_usYear;
    private ushort m_usMonth;
    private ushort m_usDayOfMonth;
    private ushort m_usHour;
    private ushort m_usMinute;
    private ushort m_usSecond;

    public Timestamp(ushort usYear,
        ushort usMonth,
        ushort usDay,
        ushort usHour,
        ushort usMinute,
        ushort usSecond)
    {
        m_usYear = usYear - 1900;
        m_usMonth = usMonth;
        m_usDay = usDay;
        m_usHour = usHour;
        m_usMinute = usMinute;
        m_usSecond = usSecond;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Static classes==
''Static classes'' are commonly used to implement a [[Computer Science Design Patterns#Singleton|Singleton Pattern]]. All of the methods, properties, and fields of a {{C sharp|static}} class are also {{C sharp|static}} (like the {{C sharp|WriteLine()}} method of the {{C sharp|System.Console}} class) and can thus be used without instantiating the {{C sharp|static}} class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public static class Writer
{
    public static void Write()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Text&quot;);
    }
}

public class Sample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Writer.Write();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Issues under discussion ==

=== Goals of book ===

The primary purpose of the book is to develop proficiency in the Japanese language, specifically:

*speaking
*listening
*reading
*writing
*cultural accustomization

This book is written for the student who either lives in Japan, or plans to do so at some point in the not too distant future. Nevertheless, the lessons and study methods are specifically designed to be effective for someone studying outside Japan, and a number of resources will be provided which will allow the student to maximize Japanese exposure at a minimal cost.

The goals for each section are broken down into both long-term goals (a level of proficiency approximating fluency) for each category as well as narrower, specific goals for each level. Currently only the basic goals have any sort of discussion backing.

==== Speaking ====
The ultimate goal of the course is to have the student conversing fluently in Japanese on any subject they are interested in. Each lesson will introduce a number of functions and tasks and provide sample dialogue, as well as vocabulary, grammar, sentence patterns, and cultural information pertaining to each. Finally, links, suggestions, and resources will be provided to allow students to practice speaking to natives in the real world.

*'''basic''': the goal of the basic course is to have the student able to appropriately perform basic conversational ''functions'' in Japanese (such as making requests or expressing refusal), as well as to accomplish ''tasks'' common to foreigners residing in Japan (such as making friends or going shopping).

==== Listening ====
Because speaking and listening are related functions, the functions and tasks above will also include practice which will aid the student in listening to Japanese. Additionally, resource links will be provided which will allow the student to practice their listening skills in the real world.

*'''basic''': the student's listening skill will be adequate to perform the tasks and functions listed in the [[Japanese/Discussion#Speaking|speaking goals]]. The student will be able to understand the gist of simple but natural Japanese.

==== Reading ====
Japanese is a particularly challenging language because of its extensive and often ambiguous use of kanji (Chinese characters). The lessons will contain snippets of authentic sources (literature, news articles, etc.) for reading purposes,  which will allow the student to not only practice identifying kanji in a natural context, but also allow for practice and discussion of grammar, usage, and discourse patterns common in the written language. To support this goal, written grammar will be explained and kanji will be taught progressively, with practice questions provided to allow students to sharpen their skills. Resources and complete external sources (literature, etc.) at the appropriate level will be provided to allow students to practice reading authentic written Japanese.

*'''basic''': the student will be able to read at a second-grade level, although the student's vocabulary will still be insufficient to read many authentic Japanese sources unaided. The student will be able to read kana and the first- and second-grade kanji (approximately 80-100 characters). Kana will be taught initially and then kanji will be introduced progressively.

*'''intermediate''': the student will develop an appreciation for discourse and stylistic conventions (e.g., newspaper Japanese).

==== Writing ====
Writing is arguably the most challenging aspect of Japanese as conversational slip-ups are often overlooked, but written language is more heavily scrutinized. Students will be provided with practice and resources which will allow them to write notes, e-mails, and short letters.

*'''basic''': the student will be able to write kana and the first- and second-grade kanji (80-100 characters). Focus will be put on short writing forms (notes, short expositions, etc.).

*'''intermediate''': the student's writing capabilities will be expanded to include essays, research papers, and creative writing.

==== Culture ====
At each level of the course, the student will have an understanding of Japanese culture sufficient to appropriately use the language learned. Cultural information will be included as part of the lesson, not as a sidebar, inasmuch as it is relevant to the way language is used. This is particularly important when learning polite and honorific speech. Other cultural information may also be introduced, and the use of authentic sources is encouraged when possible.

*'''basic''': the student will be introduced to the different in politeness levels as it relates to conjugations of verbs and adjectives. Additionally, they will understand the cultural meaning behind common Japanese rituals such as exchanging meishi, avoiding direct &quot;no&quot; responses in polite conversation, and other situations that are likely to come up in day-to-day life.

==== Underlying Fundamentals ====
To support the above goals, we will supplement the lessons with explanations of vocabulary, grammar, and kanji. These will be taught in a progressive and comprehensive fashion. Although this book is not intended to be a dictionary, grammar reference, or character book, it can and should be used along with such books to provide practice and usage examples of those concepts in a progressive fashion. All vocabulary, grammar principles, and kanji used in lessons will be explained; later lessons will build on what has been learned in previous lessons.

*'''basic''' the sudent should have a solid understanding of basic grammar, a moderate vocabularly base, and the ability to understand and communicate with approximately a hundred kanji. The student's understanding of the fundamentals will be sufficient to pass Level 4 of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.

*'''advanced''': the student should be able to function smoothly in Japan's academic, business, and other environments, pass certification tests such as the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, and have a solid linguistic foundation in the structure of the Japanese language.

==== Textbook Standards ====

Wikibooks suggests that we adopt an external set of standards to which our book should conform. This will add credibility and usability of the textbook. The following link is an example of such a set of standards.
*[http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/pn/fd/documents/foreign-language.pdf State of California Foreign Language Teaching Standards]
:In terms of this set of standards, I would suggest the competencies described in Stages I and II be the goal of the Beginner course, Stage III for Intermediate, Stage IV for Advanced, and Stage V for Expert.

:I merged the previous ''Goals of the Basic Course'' section with the above. There was a lot of content overlap previously that I've tried to alleviate.  I don't think the new organization is any more difficult to read or understand. --[[User:Telamon|Telamon]] 02:30, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

=== Lessons arrangement ===
::We have four sections. Lessons, Vocabulary, Phrases and Grammar. Each of these sections appear on the '''main page''' instead of the '''appendix'''. Lessons are '''not numbered''' so that anyone can add a lesson of whatever difficulty. The lessons link to the Vocab and Grammar pages that the specific lesson uses, so that the person can read the grammar and vocab, THEN do the lesson to see how it comes together.

::I think we can put the JLPT stuff in an apendix page. I want vocab and gramar on the '''main page''' so that it's easily referenced. We keep this book as '''shallowly linked''' as possible. With that I mean, no vocab page in the apendix. The vocab page is a section on the front page. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 12:37, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

how about organization of a specific lesson?  I was typing up one, and thought up this style -
#'''overview/summary''' - introduction
#'''structures''' - key phrases/points to be discussed
#'''examples''' - bunch of examples of sentences using the structures with English equivalents
#'''explanation''' - English dissection of the structures
#'''practice''' - problems the reader can try out (no English here)
#'''answers''' - answers to the problems -- whited out such that the reader must highlight them to view (w/ English)

not sure if examples should be before explanations or not.  that's sort of how children learn, but maybe it's not the best method adults .. examples after explanations?  of course the explanation section would have its own short set of examples as well as it's explaining various points

thoughts?

-- [[User:Antimobius|Antimobius]] 13:22, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I think we should all read up a bit on language study techniques. But &quot;Examples before explanation&quot; works really well. You should think in terms of &quot;dialogue&quot; not just &quot;examples&quot;. Also, where do you put the vocabulary, or do you just link to appendix for vocab and grammar? [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 10:29, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:definitely.  maybe looking at some ESL pages wouldn't be a bad idea, either .. as for the vocab, I hadn't actually thought about that.  I think it'd be good to have the vocab immediately available on the page, then refer the reader to the any relevant appendices
:-- [[User:Antimobius|Antimobius]] 15:45, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I guess the vocab depends on how much we want to force them to learn. I guess we can put the dialogue vocab on the page, with links to similar vocab collections. For example, we use the word &quot;today&quot;, put that on the page, and link to &quot;time and day words&quot;. 

Okay, I looked around for some language study links, and I've added the good ones to the mailinglist bookmarks. You can find them here:
[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/japanese_wiki/links/Language_teaching____001100849024/ Mailinglist Language Study Bookmarks] I hope you find them interesting. I've only had time to skim them, but I'll read them when I get time. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 07:44, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

=== Pitch Accent ===

:As for pitch accent, I personally think that it would be nice if we put in pitch accents for all of our new vocabulary. That would certainly give us an edge over most textbooks out there. :) -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 16:32, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: How will you apply the pitch marks? o-'''t&amp;#333;'''san (although my dictionary uses ''o-tóusàn''). &amp;mdash; [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 18:46, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::: o-'''t&amp;#333;'''san looks good to me. Similarly we can have:

:::* watashi
:::* '''ka'''zoku
:::* ko'''ko'''ro
:::* oto'''ko'''

::: -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 21:07, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

another way pitch could be approximated that I've seen is something like this -
:話す・は「な」す
meaning, the pitch is raised on the な and immediately lowers.  however, a word's pitch can affect subsequent particles/words as well.  I guess that could be shown by 「」 marks after or before the word, but that may be getting a bit overly complicated.  if we show pitch at all, the one of the above methods may be a good enough approximation.  it may not be 100% accurate in all cases, but it's better than not having any pitch information at all, for sure

* [http://www.epochrypha.com/japanese/#links this guy] has a pretty long list of vocabulary words marked using this system that's compatible with JWPce

(as a side note, 私 has pitch -- the た is higher) -- [[User:Antimobius|Antimobius]] 10:24, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:That's why it's indicated that way, with no markings... basically watashi is unmarked because there is no &quot;last high pitch&quot; syllable.

:If you marked high pitches instead, then you'd have:

:::* wa'''tashi'''
:::* '''ka'''zoku
:::* ko'''ko'''ro
:::* o'''toko'''

:But we won't be able to tell the difference between watashi and otoko. -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 06:50, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::Nonono, you guys got it all WRONG. When indicating pitch accent, one indicated the high to low TONE FALL. Depending on which syllable the tone fall is, the pitch can easily be figured out. The difference between a word that drops it's tone after the last syllable, or one that doesn't is clear.

::Example (drop indicated with \ and tone indicated by boldness):
:: '''wa'''\-ta-shi wa    fall on first syllable
:: wa-'''ta-shi'''\ wa    fall on last syllable
:: wa-'''ta-shi wa'''     No drop

:: For the first few times we can indicate '''tone''' with color if needs be, but what we should really do from the beginning is to indicate the '''tone fall''' in some manner. If you don't understand my explanation, then read this link, from section 1.2.4 http://www.sf.airnet.ne.jp/~ts/japanese/phoneme.html [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 09:54, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::''Isn't that what I just said?!'' I said that there is no last high pitch on &quot;watashi&quot;. Which means that there is no tone drop on &quot;watashi&quot;. Which is why it's not indicated. What else could I possibly have meant?! -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 16:10, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::::so if we show pitch drop and pitch rise (say, in different colors/whatever), it would be kosher, eh?  how would someone know that the pitch drops on the わ in わたし and rises on た if it just appears to be mono-pitched?  and how do we denote words whose pitch bleeds to the next word from the last mora, vs. words that drop pitch on the last mora?
::::-- [[User:Antimobius|Antimobius]] 11:52, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::Using the numbering scheme, it indicates where the last high pitch (or, if you like, the pitch drop) is. The scheme is already explained in the pronunciation page. It would mean a bit of memorization for the learner, but nothing too difficult.

:::The &quot;wa&quot; in &quot;watashi&quot; isn't a fall in pitch, by the way. There's a rise in pitch between &quot;wa&quot; and &quot;ta&quot;. And by indicating &quot;watashi&quot; with a zero, or with no bolded mora, we show that there is never any fall in pitch, which means that the word predictably bleeds its pitch onto the particle that follows. On the other hand, &quot;oto'''ko'''&quot;, which can either be indicated with a bold on &quot;ko&quot; or a numeral &quot;3&quot;, shows that there is a pitch drop after &quot;ko&quot;, which means any particle that comes after is low. The rise from &quot;o&quot; to &quot;to&quot; is not indicated because it can be predicted, same goes for the rise from &quot;wa&quot; to &quot;ta&quot; in &quot;watashi&quot;. -- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 14:46, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Okay, what you are saying makes sense. I agree we should indicate the last high tone, rather than show what the tone of ''each'' syllable is. Bolding the last high tone could work, but I'm not sure how it would look in hiragana. I think a down slash like I used could also work. It would emphasize that the tone drop happens AFTER a mora not ON a mora.

Okay bolding does not work well on some hiragana. Here are examples:

* おと'''こ'''
* '''か'''ぞく
* こ'''こ'''ろ

I suggest this:

* おとこ\
* か\ぞく
* ここ\ろ

It's not too pretty, but it will work. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 11:09, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Kana stroke order ==

Thanks to Mkn for the hard work that you put in here. :D I think though that you need a few extra steps... for example, for hiragana &quot;su&quot;, I'm almost certain that someone is look at the diagram, and then decide to draw the downstroke through and add the circle after (GARRGH!), and for hiragana &quot;e&quot;, I
think people are going to be really puzzled about how to do the second stroke.

Also, how about more crosslinking with [[East Asian Calligraphy|CJK]]? [[East Asian Calligraphy|CJK]] is going to cover all the groundworks of actually writing nice (how to make the dot, how to make the horizontal stroke, how to make a square, how to make a &quot;hito/jin&quot; shape, etc...).

-- [[User:Ran|Ran]] 03:54, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I dunno, the only way to accomplish what I think you want is to make animated gif images. I would be happy with small arrows just showing where each stroke starts, or an arrow head on the end of a stroke. It's up to Mkn I guess. I've got no graphics programs or skills. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 06:40, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Believe me I have thought about using arrows, but it's difficult to make it look professional when using MS Paint so I didn't include it. I welcome anyone who's good with GIMP, Photoshop, etc to add the arrows.

I used a trial software of [http://www.creabit.com/gif/ AdGif] before and it's great but the only problem is the trial version adds a watermark. See the attached example:

[[Image:hira_a.gif]]

If anyone knows of a freeware gif animator, please let me know.

Alternatively, we can just add a description of how to write the strokes. With this description, we can mention common mistakes to avoid. An example is ホ is not written like 木
-- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 15:26, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:not sure about freeware, but I have access to ImageReady, Adobe's gif animator.  let me know if that helps.  I am fairly certain it doesn't insert a watermark =)
:-- [[User:Antimobius|Antimobius]] 17:23, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: Oh Antimobius, lol, I was about to delete my comment. I feel really baka these days writing comments. It doesn't do anything. Like the saying goes: &quot;actions speak louder than words&quot;. I found [http://www.gifworks.com http://www.gifworks.com]. It's free online gif compiler. I think I already deleted the PNG files I used to make that animation above, ZANNEN NA!! -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 17:58, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Use the GIMP-GAP. It always worked for me. --[[User:Akir|Akir]]

== Soundfiles on Kana ==

Tomos has been so kind as to offer to record soundfiles for us. I asked him to record clips for the kana so far, but he is eager to do aditional recording as well. Put on your thinking caps for good ways to apply this valuable new resource we have. Check the mailinglist for the details of his offer. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 06:56, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Conventions ==
A big problem with writing a Japanese textbook (as opposed to a Spanish one) is that there are so many ways to explain and talk about Japanese that as of yet there is not one widely accepted standard for issues like romanization, verb conjugation, nomenclature, etc. Indeed, each new up-an-coming Japanese linguist tries to do it in a different way. If we go with the native Japanese way of explaining things, it may get unnecessarily complex and counter-intuitive to the foreign learner, but if we do anything else we'll have to pick and choose what we deem to be the msot effective / consistent / correct way to teach.

Conventions already decided:
*[[Japanese/Contributor's_Guide#Romanization|romanization]]

Some conventions still to be decided:
*nomenclature for parts of speech
*how to teach particles, particularly ''wa'', ''ga''
*how to teach pronouns (do we even call them pronouns?)
*how to teach inflection of ''doushi'', ''keiyoushi'', and ''keiyoudoushi''

:My textbook files あなた under &quot;pronouns&quot; and この/あそこ under &quot;demonstrative words&quot;. I'm not even sure if the latter is a part of speech, but there it is all the same. --[[User:Telamon|Telamon]] 05:52, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

::What I mean with pronouns is that it can be argued (very well) that Japanese has no pronouns in the sense that Western languages do. In fact, Japanese ''daimeishi'' are indistinguishable from nouns from a purely syntactic point of view. But since Japanese do recognize ''daimeishi'' and apply that name to our pronouns when studying English, the blanket statement &quot;there are no pronouns in Japanese&quot; is contestible. I guess what I'm getting at is, we don't want students translating &quot;I lent my book to my friend&quot; as ''watashi wa watashi no hon wo watashi no tomodachi ni kashite ageta'', so in that sense, it is useful to state that there are no &quot;true pronouns&quot; in Japanese, that pronouns in English usually translate as nothing in Japanese, and that Japanese ''daimeishi'' should be used only as a last resort in situations where clarification is impossible from context. As to &quot;demonstrative words,&quot; I think they follow roughly the same set of rules, e.g. translate them into nothing unless that destroys the sentence. For example, ''kore wa pen desu'' does not sound natural unless you are trying to emphasize the pen, e.g. &quot;No, no, no, this is a ''''pen'''', not a mechanical pencil.&quot; ----[[User:Aaronsama|Aaronsama]] 17:41, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Annexes: Generic types ==

=== Introduction ===
In order to understand Generics, we should first look why we would want to use them. This is best explained with a simple example. Let's say we want to create a collection of clients, this is something that we do often. We take a simple Client class that has a name and an account number. Often an ArrayList will be used to store multiple clients in memory like this:

   /// &lt;summary&gt;
   /// Representation of a client
   /// &lt;/summary&gt;
   public class Client
   {
       private string _name;
       private string _accountNumber;
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Gets or sets the account number.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;value&gt;The account number.&lt;/value&gt;
       public string AccountNumber
       {
           get { return _accountNumber; }
           set { _accountNumber = value; }
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Gets or sets the name.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;value&gt;The name.&lt;/value&gt;
       public string Name
       {
           get { return _name; }
           set { _name = value; }
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Initializes a new instance of the &lt;see cref=&quot;T:Client&quot;/&gt; class.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;The name.&lt;/param&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;accountNumber&quot;&gt;The account number.&lt;/param&gt;
       public Client(string name, string accountNumber)
       {
           _name = name;
           _accountNumber = accountNumber;
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// The Main entry point of the console application
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;args&quot;&gt;The command line arguments&lt;/param&gt;
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           ArrayList clients = new ArrayList();
           clients.Add(new Client(&quot;Marco&quot;, &quot;332-3355&quot;));
           clients.Add(new Client(&quot;Martinus&quot;, &quot;453-5662&quot;));
           foreach (Client client in clients)
           {
               Console.WriteLine(&quot;The account {0} belongs to {1}&quot;, client.AccountNumber, client.Name);
           }
           Console.ReadLine();
       }
   }

This probably looks familiar for most of the readers, but by using an ArrayList we are not type safe, which is in my opinion is bad. Also we need to cast (and uncast) the object when we want to do something cool with it. With value types there is an other issue, we constantly Box and unbox the objects in the list.

A better way store the clients would be to use typed collections, this will solve the problem with type safety and we don’t have to cast the retrieved object every time we use it. A good way to do this is by inheriting an object form the CollectionBase class and looks like this:
   /// &lt;summary&gt;
   /// Representation of a client
   /// &lt;/summary&gt;
   public class Client
   {
       private string _name;
       private string _accountNumber;
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Gets or sets the account number.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;value&gt;The account number.&lt;/value&gt;
       public string AccountNumber
       {
           get { return _accountNumber; }
           set { _accountNumber = value; }
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Gets or sets the name.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;value&gt;The name.&lt;/value&gt;
       public string Name
       {
           get { return _name; }
           set { _name = value; }
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Initializes a new instance of the &lt;see cref=&quot;T:Client&quot;/&gt; class.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;The name.&lt;/param&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;accountNumber&quot;&gt;The account number.&lt;/param&gt;
       public Client(string name, string accountNumber)
       {
           _name = name;
           _accountNumber = accountNumber;
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// The Main entry point of the console application
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;args&quot;&gt;The command line arguments&lt;/param&gt;
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           ClientList clients = new ClientList();
           clients.Add(new Client(&quot;Marco&quot;, &quot;332-3355&quot;));
           clients.Add(new Client(&quot;Martinus&quot;, &quot;453-5662&quot;));
           foreach (Client client in clients)
           {
               Console.WriteLine(&quot;The account {0} belongs to {1}&quot;, client.AccountNumber, client.Name);
           }
           Console.ReadLine();
       }
   }
            
   /// &lt;summary&gt;
   /// A list of clients
   /// &lt;/summary&gt;
   public class ClientList : CollectionBase
   {
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Adds the specified client to the list.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;client&quot;&gt;The client.&lt;/param&gt;
       /// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
       public int Add(Client client)
       {
           return List.Add(client);
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Gets or sets the &lt;see cref=&quot;T:Client&quot;/&gt; at the specified index.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;value&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
       public Client this[int index]
       {
           get
           {
               return (Client)List[index];
           }
           set
           {
               List[index] = value;
           }
       }
   }


This looks a lot better than when we where using the ArrayList in the first example and is in general a good way to go. But what if your application grows, and we get more types that we want to store in collections like an Account, or a bank. With the 1.1 framework we had to create a new collection class for every type of object that we used, or fall back to the ugly ArrayList method. However with the new 2.0 framework MS has added Generics. This makes it possible to create classes and methods that use type parameters. This allows developers to create classes and methods that defer the specifications of certain types until the class is defined and instantiated in the code. By using the generic type parameters developers can write classes that others can use without incurring the risks involved with un-typed classes like ArrayList and reduces the work developers have to do compared to creating typed collections. So lets look at how the code looks when we are using the Generic List&lt;T&gt; class from the framework.

   /// &lt;summary&gt;
   /// Representation of a client
   /// &lt;/summary&gt;
   public class Client
   {
       private string _name;
       private string _accountNumber;
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Gets or sets the account number.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;value&gt;The account number.&lt;/value&gt;
       public string AccountNumber
       {
           get { return _accountNumber; }
           set { _accountNumber = value; }
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Gets or sets the name.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;value&gt;The name.&lt;/value&gt;
       public string Name
       {
           get { return _name; }
           set { _name = value; }
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Initializes a new instance of the &lt;see cref=&quot;T:Client&quot;/&gt; class.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;The name.&lt;/param&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;accountNumber&quot;&gt;The account number.&lt;/param&gt;
       public Client(string name, string accountNumber)
       {
           _name = name;
           _accountNumber = accountNumber;
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// The Main entry point of the console application
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;args&quot;&gt;The command line arguments&lt;/param&gt;
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           List&lt;Client&gt; clients = new List&lt;Client&gt;();
           clients.Add(new Client(&quot;Marco&quot;, &quot;332-3355&quot;));
           clients.Add(new Client(&quot;Martinus&quot;, &quot;453-5662&quot;));
           foreach (Client client in clients)
           {
               Console.WriteLine(&quot;The account {0} belongs to {1}&quot;, client.AccountNumber, client.Name);
           }
           Console.ReadLine();
       }
   }

Thanks to Generics we have created a type-safe collection as easy as we would normally instantiate an ArrayList without writing our own typed collection.
Now that we have had a brief look at how we can use Generics to reduce the amount of code we need to write, while still using typed collections let's see how we could create our custom Generic Class. To demonstrate this I have created an example Class which inherits from the DictionaryBase class. This implementation of the dictionary class will accept a GUID as the key and has a Type parameter as the value type. If you are a bit like me you will use GUIDS to identify your records in a database so using this as the key in a Typed collection was something I liked to do a lot. So now I’ve got a cool dictionary that I can use with all my objects I created when retrieving data from my database, and I will give you the code:

   /// &lt;summary&gt;
   /// Representation of a client
   /// &lt;/summary&gt;
   public class Client
   {
       private string _name;
       private string _accountNumber;
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Gets or sets the account number.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;value&gt;The account number.&lt;/value&gt;
       public string AccountNumber
       {
           get { return _accountNumber; }
           set { _accountNumber = value; }
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Gets or sets the name.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;value&gt;The name.&lt;/value&gt;
       public string Name
       {
           get { return _name; }
           set { _name = value; }
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// Initializes a new instance of the &lt;see cref=&quot;T:Client&quot;/&gt; class.
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;The name.&lt;/param&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;accountNumber&quot;&gt;The account number.&lt;/param&gt;
       public Client(string name, string accountNumber)
       {
           _name = name;
           _accountNumber = accountNumber;
       }
        
       /// &lt;summary&gt;
       /// The Main entry point of the console application
       /// &lt;/summary&gt;
       /// &lt;param name=&quot;args&quot;&gt;The command line arguments&lt;/param&gt;
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           GuidDictonary&lt;Client&gt; clients = new GuidDictonary&lt;Client&gt;();
           Guid clientID1 = Guid.NewGuid();
           Guid clientID2 = Guid.NewGuid();
           clients.Add(clientID1, new Client(&quot;Marco&quot;, &quot;332-3355&quot;));
           clients.Add(clientID2, new Client(&quot;Martinus&quot;, &quot;453-5662&quot;));
           Console.WriteLine(&quot;The account {0} belongs to {1}&quot;, clients[clientID1].AccountNumber, clients[clientID1].Name);
           Console.WriteLine(&quot;The account {0} belongs to {1}&quot;, clients[clientID2].AccountNumber, clients[clientID2].Name);
           Console.ReadLine();
       }
   }
        
   public class GuidDictonary&lt;T&gt; : DictionaryBase
   {
       public void Add(Guid id, T item)
       {
           Dictionary.Add(id, item);
       }
        
       public T this[Guid id]
       {
           get
           {
               return (T)Dictionary[id];
           }
           set
           {
               Dictionary[id] = value;
           }
       }
   }
Well it's probably not as wonderful as you expected, a lot of methods the standard dictionary has aren’t even implemented, but hey I have to leave some fun things to do for you the reader.

So what exactly did we do in the above code? We have created a Dictonary that is indexed by a Guid and uses a type parameter to limit our add method and our indexer. Now when we create a new instance of the class and specify the type parameter we have a type-safe dictionary which can be used to store and retrieve the type of objects by the given Guid.

The T in the declaration is only a name for the thing, we could as easily use the following: VeryLongNameForTheTypeParameter instead of T.
Ok so we have seen how to use the type parameter to create a generic class. But before we move on to the next part lets look at the System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary&lt;&gt;. This class must be instantiated by providing 2 type parameters named TKey and TValue. This shows us that we can use more than one type parameter in our definition, and also shows that it was a waste of time to build my own dictionary class I could as easily used the generic dictionary like this: Dictionary&lt;Guid, Client&gt; and be over with it.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called CaladSigilon. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name CaladSigilon~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

* [[Japanese/Lessons/I-adjectives]]}}

There are two types of adjectives in modern Japanese: な- and い-adjectives. Both are descriptive and modify nouns. They describe nouns and form predicates differently.

The な-adjectives (形容動詞, けいようどうし) conjugate with nouns by appending &quot;〜な&quot; before the following noun.

When used as predicates, な-adjectives behave just like nouns:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
| だ
|}

Examples:
{| {{Japanese example}}
| {{furi|奇麗|きれい}}です。 || (She) is pretty. (formal)
|-
| {{furi|有名|ゆうめい}}です。 || (It) is famous. (formal)
|-
| {{furi|簡単|かんたん}}です。 || (This) is simple. (formal)

Note that the pronouns are usually dropped when they can be inferred from context. The pronouns in the English version are examples only to make better formed English sentences. For example, &quot;{{furi|元気|げんき}}だ&quot; can mean any of: &quot;I'm well,&quot; &quot;He's well,&quot; &quot;They're well,&quot; etc.

=== な-Adjectives noun modifiers ===
When preceding a modified noun, な-adjectives take a &quot;な&quot; before the noun:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| rowspan=2 | &lt;な-adjective&gt; な &lt;noun&gt; || です
|-
| だ
|}

Examples:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! English || Adjective || noun || sentence
|-
| a healthy person || {{furi|元気|げんき}} || {{furi|人|ひと}}
| {{furi|元気|げんき}}な{{furi|人|ひと}}です。
|-
| a famous doctor  || {{furi|有名|ゆうめい}} || {{furi|医者|いしゃ}}
| {{furi|有名|ゆうめい}}な{{furi|医者|いしゃ}}です。
|-
| an important class || {{furi|大切|たいせつ}} || {{furi|授業|じゅぎょう}}
| {{furi|大切|たいせつ}}な{{furi|授業|じゅぎょう}}です。
|}

== Practice ==

Try writing and speaking out the following sentences in Japanese:
{{col-begin|bgColor=#FFFFE0}}
{{col-break}}
'''Formal Japanese'''
#I am well.
#He is bright.
#She is famous.
#That is simple.
#She is a pretty woman.
#He is a healthy man.
#This is an important class.
#They are bright students.
{{col-break}}
'''Informal Japanese'''
#He is famous.
#She is well.
#They are bright.
#This is important.
#He is a handsome man.
#She is an important person.
#This is a tidy classroom.
#They are healthy students.
{{col-end}}

Other ideas for practice include:
* Write な-adjectives on pieces of paper along with nouns and keep these in separate stacks. Pick one of each and say the sentence.
* Now write the English on the other side and repeat, this time translating as well.
* Make pictures to represent the sentences and drill with those.
* Write a short story or describe something that happened to you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This seems like a good idea. &lt;s&gt;I would have preferred colon convention (&quot;Template:Ada Programming:Development&quot; instead of [[Template:Ada Programming/Development]]) because slash suggests subpages, but there is no &quot;Template:Ada Programming&quot; that it is a subpage of.&lt;/s&gt; (see below --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 08:01, 24 January 2006 (UTC)) However, slash convention seems useful.

Many books are linked from at least two places (such as [[Wikibooks:Miscellaneous bookshelf]] and [[Template:Miscellaneous bookshelf]]). Thus, I would find centralised stages useful. If there are no major changes to these templates soon, then I will create [[Template:Guide to X11/Development]] (for [[Guide to X11]]) and some others. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:06, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

:I don't mind whether we use slash or colon for the convention of the templates. I proposed slash because this is the convention used in ''es:'' but given that there we are using the main namespace, the superpage does indeed exist. But using the main namespace has other problems, so I think Template: should be used and consequently colon can be useful for avoiding the confusion with the subpage convention used in the main namespace. I would like to know what other people think about it before changing the template. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:40, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

----
The colon convention used for templates seems to conform better with [[WB:NP]].  There is a problem with your solution.  As [[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] points out, stage information is used in at least two places such as [[Wikibooks:Miscellaneous bookshelf]] and [[Template:Miscellaneous bookshelf]].  Trouble is, [[Wikibooks:Miscellaneous bookshelf]] would use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; while [[Template:Miscellaneous bookshelf]] would use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage short}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  I haven't looked very hard, but I don't see an good way to use stage information from a single place that would also give you a choice between &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage short}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The following would work:

: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[{{{1}}}|{{{2|{{{1}}}}}}]]&amp;amp;nbsp;{{{{{1}}}:Development|{{{3|stage short}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

where the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:Book_name:Development]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is something like:

: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{{{1|stage short}}}|50%|January 1, 2006}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

However, this is undesirable in two important respects.  

: 1. It requires the user of the template to supply a parameter for &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  One possible but somewhat ugly cure would split your template into two versions:  a three parameter version as above and the following two parameter one:

:: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[{{{1}}}]]&amp;amp;nbsp;{{{{{1}}}:Development|{{{2|stage short}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

: 2. It requires a more complicated &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Template:Book_name:Development]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; that some contributors won't get right.

Well, perhaps it's best just to apply the [[w:KISS principle]] and stick with your proposal (though I still favor the colon convention in templates for compliance with [[WB:NP]]).  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:39, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

:I had preferred colons, but the problem is that the syntax to include &quot;Template:Ada Programming:Development&quot; would be &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Ada Programming:Development}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, which would cause confusion with the syntax for transcluding pages outside the &quot;Template:&quot; namespace. For example, I when I created {{&lt;s&gt;Wikibooks:Template messages:toc&lt;/s&gt;}}, it used the Wikibooks, not Template, namespace. &lt;small&gt;(I moved &quot;Wikibooks:Template messages:toc&quot; to [[Template:Template messages]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:59, 30 January 2006 (UTC))&lt;/small&gt; In fact, if someone created &quot;Template:Cookbook:Development&quot;, the syntax &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Cookbook:Development}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; would probably fail because Cookbook is now a namespace.

:However, &quot;Template:Cookbook/Development&quot; continues to seem bad because of the mixed colons and slashes... --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 08:01, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</text>

Back in [[../Type basics II|Type basics II]] we had a brief encounter with type classes as the mechanism used with number types. As we hinted back then, however, classes have many other uses.

Broadly speaking, the point of type classes is to ensure that certain operations will be available for values of chosen types. For example, if we know a type belongs to (or, to use the jargon, ''instantiates'') the class &lt;code&gt;Fractional&lt;/code&gt;, then we are guaranteed to, among other things, be able to perform real division with its values.&lt;ref&gt;''To programmers coming from object-oriented languages'': A class in Haskell in all likelihood is ''not'' what you expect - don't let the terms confuse you. While some of the uses of type classes resemble what is done with abstract classes or Java interfaces, there are fundamental differences which will become clear as we advance.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classes and instances ==

Up to now we have seen how existing type classes appear in signatures such as:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(==) :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
&lt;/source&gt;

Now it is time to switch perspectives. First, we quote the definition of the &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; class from Prelude:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class  Eq a  where
   (==), (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool

       -- Minimal complete definition:
       --      (==) or (/=)
   x /= y     =  not (x == y)
   x == y     =  not (x /= y)
&lt;/source&gt;

The definition states that if a type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is to be made an ''instance'' of the class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; it must support the functions &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(/=)&lt;/code&gt; - the ''class methods'' - both of them having type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;. Additionally, the class provides default definitions for &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(/=)&lt;/code&gt; ''in terms of each other''. As a consequence, there is no need for a type in &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; to provide both definitions - given one of them, the other will be generated automatically.

With a class defined, we proceed to make existing types instances of it. Here is an arbitrary example of an algebraic data type made into an instance of &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; by an ''instance declaration'':

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Foo = Foo {x :: Integer, str :: String}
 
instance Eq Foo where
   (Foo x1 str1) == (Foo x2 str2) = (x1 == x2) &amp;&amp; (str1 == str2)
&lt;/source&gt;

And now we can apply &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(/=)&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; values in the usual way:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; Foo 3 &quot;orange&quot; == Foo 6 &quot;apple&quot;
False
*Main&gt; Foo 3 &quot;orange&quot; /= Foo 6 &quot;apple&quot;
True
}}

A few important remarks:

* The class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; is defined in the Standard Prelude. This code sample defines the type &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; and then declares it to be an instance of &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;.  The three definitions (class, data type, and instance) are ''completely separate'' and there is no rule about how they are grouped. This works both ways: you could just as easily create a new class &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt; and then declare the type &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt; to be an instance of it.

* ''Classes are not types'', but categories of types; and so the instances of a class are types instead of values.&lt;ref&gt;This is a key difference from most OO languages, where a class is also itself a type.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The definition of &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; relies on the fact that the values of its fields (namely &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;) are also members of &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;.  In fact, almost all types in Haskell are members of &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt; (the most notable exception being functions).

* Type synonyms defined with &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; keyword cannot be made instances of a class.

== Deriving ==

Since equality tests between values are commonplace, in all likelihood most of the data types you create in any real program should be members of &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt;. A lot of them will also be members of other Prelude classes such as &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Show&lt;/tt&gt;.  To avoid large amounts of boilerplate for every new type, Haskell has a convenient way to declare the &quot;obvious&quot; instance definitions using the keyword &lt;tt&gt;deriving&lt;/tt&gt;. So, &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; would be written as:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Foo = Foo {x :: Integer, str :: String}
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
&lt;/source&gt;

This makes &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt; with an automatically generated definition of &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; exactly equivalent to the one we just wrote, and also makes it an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Show&lt;/tt&gt; for good measure.

You can only use &lt;tt&gt;deriving&lt;/tt&gt; with a limited set of built-in classes, which are described ''very'' briefly below:

; Eq : Equality operators &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt;

; Ord : Comparison operators &lt;tt&gt;&lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=&lt;/tt&gt;; &lt;tt&gt;min&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;max&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;compare&lt;/tt&gt;.

; Enum : For enumerations only.  Allows the use of list syntax such as &lt;tt&gt;[Blue .. Green]&lt;/tt&gt;.

; Bounded : Also for enumerations, but can also be used on types that have only one constructor.  Provides &lt;tt&gt;minBound&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;maxBound&lt;/tt&gt; as the lowest and highest values that the type can take.

; Show : Defines the function &lt;tt&gt;show&lt;/tt&gt;, which converts a value into a string, and other related functions.

; Read : Defines the function &lt;tt&gt;read&lt;/tt&gt;, which parses a string into a value of the type, and other related functions.

The precise rules for deriving the relevant functions are given in the language report.  However, they can generally be relied upon to be the &quot;right thing&quot; for most cases.  The types of elements inside the data type must also be instances of the class you are deriving.

This provision of special &quot;magic&quot; function synthesis for a limited set of predefined classes goes against the general Haskell philosophy that &quot;built in things are not special&quot;, but it does save a lot of typing. Besides that, deriving instances stops us from writing them in the wrong way (an example: an instance of &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;x == y&lt;/code&gt; would not be equal to &lt;code&gt;y == x&lt;/code&gt; would be flat out wrong). &lt;ref&gt;There are ways to make the magic apply to other classes. GHC extensions allow &lt;code&gt;deriving&lt;/code&gt; for a few other common classes for which there is only one correct way of writing the instances, and the GHC generics machinery make it possible to generate instances automatically for custom classes.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Class inheritance ==

Classes can inherit from other classes.  For example, here is the main part of the definition of &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; in Prelude:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class  (Eq a) =&gt; Ord a  where
    compare              :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering
    (&lt;), (&lt;=), (&gt;=), (&gt;) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    max, min             :: a -&gt; a -&gt; a
&lt;/source&gt;

The actual definition is rather longer and includes default implementations for most of the functions.  The point here is that &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; inherits from &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt;.  This is indicated by the &lt;tt&gt;=&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; notation in the first line, which mirrors the way classes appear in type signatures. Here, it means that for a type to be an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Ord&lt;/tt&gt; it must also be an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Eq&lt;/tt&gt;, and hence needs to implement the &lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt; operations.&lt;ref&gt;If you check the full definition in the {{Haskell lib|Prelude}} specification, the reason for that becomes clear: the default implementations involve applying &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt; to the values being compared.&lt;/ref&gt;

A class can inherit from several other classes: just put all of its superclasses in the parentheses before the &lt;tt&gt;=&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. Let us illustrate that with yet another Prelude quote:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class  (Num a, Ord a) =&gt; Real a  where
    -- | the rational equivalent of its real argument with full precision
    toRational          ::  a -&gt; Rational
&lt;/source&gt;

== Standard classes ==

This diagram, copied from the Haskell Report, shows the relationships between the classes and types in the Standard Prelude.  The names in bold are the classes, while the non-bold text stands for the types that are instances of each class (&lt;tt&gt;(-&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; refers to functions and &lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt;, to lists). The arrows linking classes indicate the inheritance relationships, pointing to the inheriting class.

[[Image:Classes.svg]]

== Type constraints ==

With all pieces in place, we can go full circle by returning to the very first example involving classes in this book: 

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(+) :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;(Num a) =&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a ''type constraint'', which restricts the type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to instances of the class &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt;. In fact, &lt;code&gt;(+)&lt;/code&gt; is a method of &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt;, along with quite a few other functions (notably, &lt;code&gt;(*)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(-)&lt;/code&gt;; but not &lt;code&gt;(/)&lt;/code&gt;). 

You can put several limits into a type signature like this:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
foo :: (Num a, Show a, Show b) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; String
foo x y t = 
   show x ++ &quot; plus &quot; ++ show y ++ &quot; is &quot; ++ show (x+y) ++ &quot;.  &quot; ++ show t
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, the arguments &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; must be of the same type, and that type must be an instance of both &lt;tt&gt;Num&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Show&lt;/tt&gt;.  Furthermore, the final argument &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; must be of some (possibly different) type that is also an instance of &lt;tt&gt;Show&lt;/tt&gt;. This example also displays clearly how constraints propagate from the functions used in a definition (in this case, &lt;code&gt;(+)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt;) to the function being defined.

=== Other uses ===

Beyond simple type signatures, type constraints can be introduced in a number of other places:

* &lt;code&gt;instance&lt;/code&gt; declarations (typical with parametrized types&lt;!--; we will present an example of such usage shortly--&gt;);

* &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; declarations (constraints can be introduced in the method signatures in the usual way for any type variable other than the one defining the class&lt;ref&gt;Constraints for the type defining the class should be set via class inheritance.&lt;/ref&gt;);

* &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; declarations,&lt;ref&gt;And &lt;code&gt;newtype&lt;/code&gt; declarations as well, but not &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; where they act as constraints for the constructor signatures. 

{{body note|1=
Type constraints in &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; declarations are less useful than it might seem at first. Consider:

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data (Num a) =&gt; Foo a = F1 a | F2 a String
&lt;/source&gt;

Here, &lt;tt&gt;Foo&lt;/tt&gt; is a type with two constructors, both taking an argument of a type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; which must be in &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt;. However, the &lt;code&gt;(Num a) =&gt;&lt;/code&gt; constraint is only effective for the &lt;tt&gt;F1&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;F2&lt;/tt&gt; constructors, and not for other functions involving &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, in the following example...

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fooSquared :: (Num a) =&gt; Foo a -&gt; Foo a
fooSquared (F1 x)   = F1 (x * x)
fooSquared (F2 x s) = F2 (x * x) s
&lt;/source&gt;

... even though the constructors ensure &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; will be some type in &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt; we can't avoid duplicating the constraint in the signature of &lt;code&gt;fooSquared&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Extra note for the curious'': This issue is related to some of the problems tackled by the advanced features discussed in the &quot;Fun with types&quot; chapter of the Advanced Track.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== A concerted example ==

To provide a better view of the interplay between types, classes, and constraints, we will present a very simple and somewhat contrived example. We will define a &lt;code&gt;Located&lt;/code&gt; class, a &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt; class which inherits from it, and a function with a &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt; constraint implemented using the methods of the parent class, i.e. &lt;code&gt;Located&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- Location, in two dimensions.
class Located a where
    getLocation :: a -&gt; (Int, Int)

class (Located a) =&gt; Movable a where
    setLocation :: (Int, Int) -&gt; a -&gt; a

-- An example type, with accompanying instances.
data NamedPoint = NamedPoint
    { pointName :: String
    , pointX    :: Int
    , pointY    :: Int
    } deriving (Show)

instance Located NamedPoint where
    getLocation p = (pointX p, pointY p)

instance Movable NamedPoint where
    setLocation (x, y) p = p { pointX = x, pointY = y }

-- Moves a value of a Movable type by the specified displacement.
-- This works for any movable, including NamedPoint.
move :: (Movable a) =&gt; (Int, Int) -&gt; a -&gt; a
move (dx, dy) p = setLocation (x + dx, y + dy) p
    where
    (x, y) = getLocation p
&lt;/source&gt;

=== A word of advice ===

Do not read too much into the &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt; example just above; it is merely a demonstration of class-related language features. It would be a mistake to think that every single functionality which might be conceivably generalized, such as &lt;code&gt;setLocation&lt;/code&gt;, needs a type class of its own. In particular, if all your &lt;code&gt;Located&lt;/code&gt; instances should be able to be moved as well then &lt;code&gt;Movable&lt;/code&gt; is unnecessary - and if there is just one instance there is no need for type classes at all! Classes are best used when there are several types instantiating it (or if you expect others to write additional instances) and you do not want users to know or care about the differences between the types. An extreme example would be &lt;code&gt;Show&lt;/code&gt;: general-purpose functionality implemented by an immense number of types, about which you do not need to know a thing about before calling &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt;. In the following chapters, we will explore a number of important type classes in the libraries; they provide good examples of the sort of functionality which fits comfortably into a class.

1. 

* Angle 2 = 120 degrees since it is supplementary to angle 1. Supplementary angles are any two angles whose sum is 180 degrees.
* Angle 3 = 60 degrees since
* Angle 1 and Angle 3 are vertical angles. Vertical angles are two nonadjacent angles formed by two intersecting lines.
* Angle 4 = 120 degrees since it is supplementary to angle 1.
* Angle 5 = angle 1 by the Transversal Postulate.
* Angle 6 = angle 2, angle 7 = angle 3, and angle 8 = angle 4 by the Transversal Postulate.

2.

*Angle 2 = angle 3 is given
*Lines R and S are parallel by the Alternate Interior Angles Converse Postulate

== Chapter 5 ==
=== Section 5.1 - Methods of Proving that Triangles are Congruent ===
1. Yes; triangle RUN = triangle DIH by ASA

2. No; the sides and angles do not match

3. Yes; triangle SUM = triangle HRC by ASA

4. Yes; triangle QWE = triangle TYR by SSS

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note: regarding the key components of a patent, isn't the specification the key component. Technically the specification contains the claims as well as the description of the invention. That's what I read at the USPTO MPEP site.

Also, I believe there are a number of other defenses that can be listed under &quot;Defenses&quot; to infringement- for instance, contending that the patent is invalid becaue of a 102b bar or the disovery of additional prior art.

== 1 yr clock for novelty or not? ==

The novelty text reads: &quot;So when a magazine is sent to subscribers or a dissertation is shelved in a library, the one-year clock begins for any inventions described therein.&quot;, but the description says nothing about a 1 year clock.  Which of the two is wrong? [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 10:45, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

I believe that this question is old, and the text of the novelty section already clarifies this point.  However, to be certain, here goes:  the &quot;1 year clock&quot; means that publication of an invention is not an absolute bar to filing a patent application in the United States.  An inventor (meaning either the author of the publication or someone who came up with the invention before the author thought of it) can still file a patent application within one year of the publication.  However, any patent application filed more than one year after publication of an invention should not be issued as a patent, and any such mistakenly issued patent is invalid.  --[[User:Adubberley|Adubberley]] 01:34, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

== 100% == 
how is this article marked as 100%?  it's nowhere near close to that.--[[User:Aosik|Aosik]] 17:45, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

== First to Invent ==
This book is out of date and needs to be updated.
Particularly, in the book is stated that ''&quot;In the United States, a patentee must be the first to invent.&quot;'' However, the United States changed from a first-to-invent system to a first-to-file system in 2013.--[[User:Skorovs|Skorovs]] ([[User talk:Skorovs|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Skorovs|contribs]]) 00:40, 6 April 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The format of Policy-Debate as designed by the National Forensic League (NFL) is a series of alternating speeches between the affirmative team and the negative team.  Generally the time limits described below are pretty universal, only the time of cross-examination is usually altered.


8 - First Affirmative Constructive

3 - Cross-Examination (2N)

8 - First Negative Constructive

3 - Cross-Examination (1A)

8 - Second Affirmative Constructive

3 - Cross-Examination (1N)

8 - Second Negative Constructive

3 - Cross-Examination (2A)

5 - First Negative Rebuttal

5 - First Affirmative Rebuttal

5 - Second Negative Rebuttal

5 - Second Affirmative Rebuttal


As is should be, the Affirmative has the final word in the debate, because after all, the decision of the judge relies on the infallibility of the 
Affirmative proposal, or the Negative's interpretation and demonstration of the fallible parts of the Affirmative proposal under the resolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The meat of a policy debate comes from the stock issues.  To easily remember the stock issues, debaters often use the acronym &quot;SHITS.&quot;

; Significance : How ''significant'' is the problem that you are trying to remedy through your interpretation of the resolution? 

; Hegemony : 

; Inherency : What is ''inherent'' in the status quo that prevents your problem from already being solved?

; Topicality : Does your case fall within the ''topic''? Does your case meet the parameters of the resolution?  

; Solvency : Does your plan actually ''solve'' the problem?

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''quinzhee''' is a type of snow shelter made by making a pile of snow, waiting for it to settle together, then hollowing out the inside. In contrast, an igloo is made by carefully stacking cut blocks of snow.

== Design principles ==
It is not difficult to make a quinzhee, though it will be warmer and stronger if certain techniques are carefully followed and on that note, make sure you live in an area with snow, or this will have little use to you, a stupid wikibook, right?. For strength, the quinzhee needs to be a dome and the lower walls must not need to support too much weight. The walls should be very thick at the base and get slightly thinner towards to the top of the dome. 

For warmth, the entrance of the quinzhee should be a tunnel with an upward sloping floor such that the floor is slightly higher than the top of the entrance. Be careful not to increase the height of the door by hitting it with your back each time you enter! And DO NOT bring a heater in with you, or the structure might melt on you.

== How to build a quinzhee ==
To make a quinzhee, make a large dome of snow. When making the pile, consider the inside shape that you want. A quinzhee to sleep two should have an oval footprint. Remember to make it high enough so that the floor can be elevated. Placing it on a hill can help with this. The length needs to be the wall thickness plus the length of your sleeping bag.

Once the pile is done, insert sticks straight in to a depth of 30 cm. As you dig it out, these sticks will tell you when you are near the outside so that you won't dig through. Wait for an hour or two for the snow to settle. The snow will re-form into a hard material that will not fall in when it is dug out.

Dig out the quinzhee with a small shovel. The fastest way is to cut blocks and push those towards the door. Cut the blocks left, right, top, and bottom. Don't pry too much as this can create cracks in the wall. As you get further in, it will be helpful to have a person outside moving the snow out of the tunnel and away. Eventually, two people will be able to fit inside and the digging goes much faster.

QuickTime, Apple's media player, is widely considered to one of &quot;big three&quot; audio/video players availible. The other two, Microsoft's Windows Media Player and Real Media's Real Player, are also availible for the Mac, but are not included out of the box.

QuickTime files are actually just digital &quot;shells&quot; containing two different files: an audio file and a video file. This provides content makers with a huge amount of flexibility.

== Overview ==

'''''House-elves''''' are small creatures with big eyes, long noses, and bat-like ears, and are usually very poorly clothed. They can often be found at large houses and mansions. They are supposed to be very loyal to the head of their family. An owner or master can 'free' a house elf by giving him or her clothes.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

House-elves are essentially slaves – they will serve one family for a long part of their life, and they feel that this is right and proper, that this is what they were created to do. At Hogwarts there are hundreds of house-elves, preparing the food for the feasts, cleaning, and doing other chores. House-elves are bound to listen to members of the family they belong to, but can choose to disobey anyone else. In extraordinary circumstances, they can even disobey their masters, but afterwards they will punish themselves quite harshly for it. Three house-elves play a significant role in the books: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Winky|Winky]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]]; a fourth one, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hokey|Hokey]], is mentioned (in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 20|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], where she serves [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]]), but does not play a particularly significant role.

== Analysis ==

Quite obviously, most house-elves are content with their status, and believe that their situation, caring for their owners in return for shelter and, presumably, food, is right and proper. In fact, house-elves are considered chattel in the Wizarding world, and presumably could be sold; while we never see this, we do note that at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius']] death, Kreacher is apparently included as being part of the house and property which [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] inherits. Kreacher has no say in this, he very strongly resists becoming the slave of one he considers a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Mudblood|Mudblood]], but he must, all the same, obey Harry's orders. We cannot know whether there is a magical component to Kreacher's transference of allegiance, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] sees it as proof that ownership of Sirius' house has passed to Harry. This suggests, first, that magic is involved, rather than simply tradition; and second, that Kreacher is considered a part of the house, and thus property rather than an individual.

House-elves can be freed; giving a house-elf clothes frees it from its situation, which is why they are so ill-clothed. They must wear whatever castoffs they can scavenge, which results in many of them wearing things like discarded, damaged pillowcases and rags twisted into rude loincloths. Most house-elves, however, do not want to be freed, and resist the suggestion most strongly. One exception is Dobby, who was the house-elf of the Malfoy family; he was so ill-treated there that he rebelled and eventually left their employ when Harry managed to engineer his receiving socks from his master, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]]. As a free house-elf, Dobby was unable to find work for a year or so, eventually joining the kitchen staff at Hogwarts; it seems that most wizards don't want house-elves that they have to pay for, even if it is only a Galleon per month.

When Winky is dismissed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], Dobby manages to get her employed at Hogwarts as well; however, she doesn't want to work, she simply sits, mourning the loss of her position and drinking herself to oblivion, for almost a year. She has not directly appeared in any of the books since then, though Dobby does mention her again in the next book.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] tries to start up an organization to combat this apparent slavery, the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare (S.P.E.W.), but quite apart from the unfortunate acronym, she meets a substantial amount of resistance, not only from wizards and witches who like having house-elves around to serve them, but from the house-elves themselves who prefer security to freedom. Hermione's attempts to emancipate the Hogwarts house elves, by hiding clothing under garbage in the Gryffindor common room where elves will pick it up, is seen as insulting by the elves; they understand dismissal as a sign of completely failing their master or family. Hermione's effort would be ineffective, even if the elves did not react by shunning Gryffindor tower, leaving Dobby the job of cleaning Gryffindor by himself. It is only an elf's master who can free him by giving him clothes, which means Albus Dumbledore, or possibly one of the staff, but the students are not in a position of authority over the elves.

Hermione may have been misled in her efforts by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] recounting of how Dobby gained his freedom. It was Harry's sock, originally, but Harry had given it to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], and it was Lucius who had inadvertently given it to Dobby. Harry understood, as Hermione apparently does not, that if Harry had given the sock to Dobby directly, it would not have freed him. Interestingly, Harry himself falls into this same mistake in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 23|the fifth book]]: seeing that Hermione has a gift for Kreacher, he cautions her about giving Kreacher clothes, forgetting that only Sirius, Kreacher's master, could free him.

House-elves have a tendency to over-simplify the language. They refer to themselves in the third person (&quot;Dobby is most sorry, sir...&quot;) and use full names (&quot;Dobby cannot let Harry Potter lose his Wheezy!&quot;), both of which would seem to imply an uncertainty about the use of language – the intricacies of &quot;I&quot; versus &quot;you&quot;, and the appropriate use of names and nicknames, seems to be beyond them. This would imply a lower level of verbal intelligence than humans have. Additionally, Dobby's efforts to prevent Harry from returning to Hogwarts, or to get him to return to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] once he is there, seem quite poorly thought out, almost child-like, again suggesting a less sophisticated level of intelligence. From this, one can see why a house-elf would be afraid to be freed; the world is a scary place for one so surrounded by people smarter than himself.

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The intellect of house elves is probably best described as &quot;child-like&quot;. This is telegraphed to us by their use of language; specifically, the confusion of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;you&quot;, and the misuse of full names and nicknames, is characteristic of the very young. In ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', we also see that Dobby's attempts to prevent Harry's return to Hogwarts, and to send him home once he is back at school, are quite childish. The same is true of Kreacher's loyalty. When we first see him, Kreacher is plainly rebelling, in a sullen and childish manner, against the orders of a Master he feels is unworthy. Circumstance has made it necessary for him to accept [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius']] orders; nothing will make him like it, and he will resist every way he can. Kreacher behaves the same way when Harry becomes his Master in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 3|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. In the same book, we see a direct contrast between Kreacher's barely-below-the-surface rebellion, and Dobby's enthusiastic loyalty, when the two of them are assigned the same task by Harry.

It is because of this perceived child-like intelligence that we are able to accept Kreacher's sudden change of loyalty when Harry enlists his aid to retrieve [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]] and the locket Kreacher had been instructed to destroy. The very young are able to form very sudden and deep alliances for what seem quite trivial reasons, and Kreacher's response to Harry actually caring about the same things Kreacher cares about would be characteristic of this. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron's]] caution that Harry was &quot;over the top&quot; when he gave [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Regulus Black|Regulus']] locket to Kreacher was not accurate; although it did result in Kreacher falling apart emotionally, it was necessary so that he could reassemble, centered around Harry, rather than around Sirius' mother.

The status and situation of house elves is complicated.  Applying human values to &quot;help&quot; non-humans is not as straightforward as some, including Hermione, believe at first.  Hermione's campaign with S.P.E.W. is laudable and correct, elves are slaves and should be given the rights, privileges and respect humans enjoy.  However, she finds difficulty in understanding the values and desires of most elves.  Initially she wishes to free all elves and have them paid wages for their work.  The elves, with few exceptions, consider this an insult to their honor.  Elves appear to have been bred or enchanted to view their servitude as a noble vocation rather than enslavement.  This breeding and enchantment is obviously the selfish work of wizards in the far past who desired the luxury of dedicated servants who cost nothing.  Such a tradition, as Hermione finds out, is difficult to reform and requires some patience.  Eventually the elves, including Kreacher, achieve some enlightenment, and the victory banquet at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 36|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] is shared by elves, humans and others as friends and equals.

Not mentioned above is the apparent fact that House Elf magic is not of the same type as human magic. In particular, we are told numerous times that Hogwarts is protected against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]], that you cannot Apparate into or out of Hogwarts, or even within Hogwarts except when the spells are locally and temporarily lifted in the Great Hall for Apparition class. Yet, Dobby is clearly able to Disapparate from Harry's grip in the Hospital Wing; we see that in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]. This shows that House Elf Disapparition is different from &quot;wand-bearer&quot; Disapparition in two respects: first, it can be done in places where the human spell is blocked, and second, it can be used to get away from someone who is holding the caster, something that evidently is not so easily accomplished by humans.

This ability of House Elves to Apparate where humans cannot plays a fairly important role later in the series as well. Kreacher, taken to the cave of the locket, is able to return to the Black house and tell Regulus what had happened, despite [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] having surrounded the location with various protective and preventative spells, and despite Kreacher's then being dragged underwater by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Inferius|Inferi]]. It is Kreacher's information that leads Harry to a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]].

Whether other House Elf magic is significantly different from human magic is uncertain. We know that House Elves do not carry wands, and so there is certainly a difference in the way magic is produced; however, apparently House-Elf magic can be stopped by human magic, as Mundungus Fletcher is able to loot [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]] despite Kreacher's efforts to stop him.

==Ingredients==

*1 cup (240ml) grated coconut, preferably fresh (if using frozen grated coconut, defrost it before use)
*2 red chile peppers (dried)
*1/2 tsp turmeric powder
*2 pepper corns
*A piece of tamarind (the size of a small marble)
*1/2 onion chopped fine
*1 drumstick (frozen works fine 8-10pieces)
*10-15 shrimp cleaned and de-veined
*Asafoetida - just a pinch.

Alternatively the recipe can be made with any white fish (vellyo, muddashi, shevtali, visvaan).

==Procedure==

# Put the shrimp, onion, drumsticks and asafoetida in a sauce pan. Add a little water and cook until the shrimp and drumsticks are done. If using white fish instead of shrimp, then omit the shrimp at this stage
# Grind the grated coconut, chillies, turmeric, pepper and tamarind to a fine paste. If needed, add a tiny amount of water to form a thick fine paste. Avoid watering down the paste as far as possible.
# Add to the shrimp mix and bring to a boil. If using white fish, add at this point.
# Add salt to taste.
# Serve with hot white rice


The traditional way of eating Shrimp Hooman is with hot steaming rice and raw mango pickle .

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Along with a range of print books, there are a number of Haskell tutorials scattered around the web.  None of these can provide a one-stop-shop for the student of Haskell.  The print books mostly describe Haskell 98, but since then many of the &quot;extensions&quot; introduced by GHC have since become ''de facto'' standards.  In addition, the theory and practice of monads has expanded greatly and arrows are starting to become used in mainstream libraries.  Hence, the neophyte Haskeller is faced with a collection of disorganised resources, including textbooks, academic papers written by and for experts, isolated tutorials and explanations on Wiki pages, and, of course, willing helpers on mailing lists, IRC channels, and forums.

Making the most of all the resources can be a frustrating and difficult experience.  Ideally, this Wikibook will continue to evolve and grow along with the language. We want a definitive reference where Haskell programmers can easily find the next thing that they must learn and then learn to understand it fully and clearly.  To this end, contributors should observe the following:

* Ensure that you only use a language construct or concept ''after'' it has been explained.  This can be difficult: Haskell contains many sophisticated concepts in a tight-knit whole with each supporting the others.  Nevertheless, it is impossible to learn a language by swallowing the whole thing at once.  A good tutorial splits things up into digestible chunks.  Sometimes, explaining or demonstrating things in a clumsier or less general way than you would like helps keep things accessible.

* Do not treat the existing text or structure as sacrosanct.  If there is a place for improvement, then by all means go ahead and change things.  Remember that Wikibooks are under version control, so any mistake can always be backed out.  (Having said that, major changes should probably be discussed first).

* Feel free to run ahead with writing more advanced topics, even if the main text has not caught up.  In particular, chapters on Concurrency, GADTs, Arrows, Parsing, User Interfaces, and FP Design Principles all need work.  Just make a note in the introduction about any pre-requisites that the main text does not yet cover.

== What ''you'' can do ==
Anyone who knows some Haskell should be able to contribute here. If you are...

* New to Haskell: Please read through some of the first modules in the book. These will be crucial to you starting to understand the language. If they're not clear enough, they need to be changed. If you can't understand them, or find they don't provide a wide enough knowledge base, add a complaint on one of the talk pages (best to do it to the talk page to of the [[../|contents page]]).
* Still getting used to Haskell: You're in the perfect position to 'refactor' the beginners' modules in the Wikibook! You know best what's helpful to newcomers and what's just downright confusing. Be brave, delete large chunks of text if they're simply rubbish.
* Growing up with Haskell: There are plenty of tasks for you. The Wikibook needs better coverage of the Hierarchical modules (don't overlap with the Haddock docs ''too'' much, though) as well as new exercises (and answers too!). The advanced modules could use some refactoring.
* A veritable expert: There are ''many'' new modules you could start or propose. The Wikibook doesn't have a limited scope. It would be great to cover lots of the more advanced topics.

Please, please, get involved! Chop and change as much as you want. Again, the whole book is on version control, so ''no'' change is too drastic.

== Getting in touch ==

Note that Wikibook contributors can sometimes be found in the #haskell channel on irc.freenode.net.  That is a great place to discuss ideas and directions.

There is also a mailing list specific to the Haskell wikibook (and actually all Haskell educational materials).  See http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/wikibook/

Below are some notes from past and current contributors about efficient editing of the Wikibook:

== Using Emacs ==

''FIXME: publish this somewhere more sensible'' &lt;!-- Why not just add it to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia-mode.el ? Aside from MVS, it is just about a duplicate. --&gt;

I love Emacs and can't stand using a &lt;code&gt;text area&lt;/code&gt; to edit Wikibook pages in, especially long ones where I'm going to be writing a lot. After Firefox crashing on me once or twice and me losing several hours work, I realised there has to be a more sensible way of contributing to MediaWiki projects. This is what I've come up with:

=== wikipedia-mode.el ===
Firstly, [http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/WikipediaMode wikipedia-mode] is essential for font-locking. It's built on outline mode. It does, however, include a few stupid shortcuts, so here is how ''I'' have it installed:

 (autoload 'wikipedia-mode &quot;wikipedia.el&quot;
  &quot;Major mode for editing documents in Wikipedia markup.&quot; t)
 (add-hook 'wikipedia-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
 (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist 
   '(&quot;\\.wiki\\'&quot; . wikipedia-mode))
 (defun unset-wikipedia-bindings ()
   (interactive)
   (local-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-&lt;up&gt;&quot;))
   (local-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-&lt;down&gt;&quot;))
   (local-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-&lt;left&gt;&quot;))
   (local-unset-key (kbd &quot;C-&lt;right&gt;&quot;)))
 (add-hook 'wikipedia-mode-hook 'unset-wikipedia-bindings)

=== MVS ===
Now we can edit MediaWiki files in Emacs, it'd be nice to post them back to the server without having to copy-paste into Firefox. A guy called Mark Jaroski wrote [http://search.cpan.org/~markj/WWW-Mediawiki-Client-0.31/bin/mvs MVS], which is a client-side program for interacting with MediaWiki servers. Here's a typical session:

 Specify login details for the wikibook, with the 'en' locale
 mvs login -d wikibooks.org -u &lt;username&gt; -p &lt;password&gt; -l en
 Pull the 'Haskell/Notes for contributors' module from the server
 mvs update 'Haskell/Notes for contributors.wiki'
 ... hack away on that file ...
 Commit the changes back to the server
 mvs commit -m &quot;New notes&quot; 'Haskell/Notes for contributors.wiki'

There'll be a new version, 1.0, soonish, which should contain some new features making life a little easier. Here's an extract from an email conversation I've had with him indicating what'll be added:

 &gt; I've been using MVS for a while now, moving my Wikibooks editing over

 &gt; integrate Emacs and MVS a bit further. The end result will basically
 &gt; be the ability to do C-x v v (that's Emacs-speak for Ctrl+x, then v,

 That's very cool.  I have a similar vim module.
 
 &gt; Firstly, the restriction that you have to issue commands from the

 &gt; restrictive. :) Say if I download Foo/Bar, then cd to Foo, I should be
 &gt; able to update/commit/preview/etc Bar, with the relative paths
 &gt; resolved. Is this feasible?
 
 Yes, but I think it's probably going to have to wait for the
 next version or so.  I'm working on an major overhaul for
 the 1.0 version, with more of an OO api.  This will make it
 easier to add images and other neato things.
 
 &gt; Secondly, MVS is slow. I realise this is probably because WikiMedia's
 &gt; servers aren't the snappiest in the world, and most of the time, I'm
 &gt; willing to wait for update and commit commands, but preview is where
 &gt; it bites. I'd like the possibility to install MediaWiki locally, then
 &gt; have MVS fire off preview requests to the local, rather than remote,
 &gt; server. This would basically boil down to an option allowing you to
 &gt; have a separate recipient address for previews, AFAICT. 
 
 That's also part of my little plan.  Of course you can
 pretty much get this effect now just by having two
 .mediawiki files and swapping them around when you want to
 switch servers.
 
 &gt; I can think of two problems here: templates obviously
 &gt; wouldn't work, and namespaces might get a little funky.
 &gt; However I'm willing to live with both of these for a
 &gt; faster preview. In the future, perhaps you could also
 &gt; implement something to download all the templates linked
 &gt; to from a page, perhaps even automatically.
 
 I agree.

=== VC bindings ===
Not implemented yet, but in the Big Plan, is to write some VC bindings for Emacs, so committing should be as easy as C-x v v. However, I'm going to wait until some of the aforementioned features are implemented. At the moment, my design for key bindings will be something like:

; C-x v v, C-c C-f : Commit file to the server.
; C-c C-m : Commit minor version to the server
; C-c C-p : Preview the file.

In addition to the VC bindings.

=== Fast preview ===
Most of MVS is slow, but that's okay, because MediaWiki is slow. However, previewing is one area where things could be improved. My plan is to install a local MediaWiki, then have an option in MVS to send preview requests to that server instead of to the remote one, speeding things up. As Mark points out, this is available currently by swapping the .mediawiki files over.

If you've got any ideas, tack them up here.

== Using your favourite text editor ==

Most of the hints above can be adapted to other text editors.  See [[w:Wikipedia:Text_editor_support|Text editor support on Wikipedia]] for details.

== Formatting tips ==

* A very common problem involves text on the first few lines of a page overlapping with the chapter table of contents in the right side. To fix that, place {{tl|clear}} at the very beginning of the page, just above the chapter TOC.
* A related problem sometimes affects the navigation boxes at the bottom of the page, which can get squeezed to a very narrow width when there are other box templates just above them. Separating the boxes with {{tl|-}} fixes the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Planes fly by virtue of '''Bernoulli's principle''' on their wings.  Air being pushed under the wings only accounts for a small portion of the lift forces that make an airplane fly.  The real lift forces results from the partial vaccum created above the wings (Bernoulli's principle).  In effect, a plane rises on account that it wings are being &quot;sucked up&quot; from above. 

To get the Bernoulli effect (and to lift the plane), the wings must expose a larger surface on top than below the wing.  A curved wing does just that.  

Second, we need to maintain a flow of air over and under the wings.  This is the job of the engine, which pulls the plane and its wings forward, using a propeller. Once the airplane accelerates to take to a speed sufficient to generate enough lift for the airplane to fly, the airplane can take off. The way, a propeller is nothing more than a spinning wing - it also uses Bernoulli's principle to draw the airplane forward.

From the dawn of time, human beings have always tried to find new ways to solve problems, be more productive, work with numbers faster, and have better ways of storing information. From the early human counting systems to the abacus, the slide-rule, and then later calculators, the persistent creation of ever more complex tools with the aim to allow human beings to expand the power of their minds has never stopped.

Men's and boy's models:
Electric (Back set) 

Marlin--Men's waterproof, 11/16&quot; strap.

Mercury--Men's round non-waterproof, 11/16 strap

Monroe--Rectangular non-waterproof, 11/16 strap

Sportster--Boy's waterproof, 1/2&quot; strap

Sprite:  Men's small waterproof, 5/8 strap

Super-thin/Wafer-thin  11/16 strap, no sweep second. Case was tapered, far thinner at the edges than the middle.  

Viscount--Automatic (self-wind) 11/16 strap, thicker than Marlin or Mercury

21 Series--Available in both regular--similar to Marlin and Self-wind, similar to Viscount

400--Similar to 21, but with either Seiko or Laco-Durow 17 jewel movement.  These movements were almost certainly superior to the 21. 


Women's watches are harder to identify by series--While the series each had usual characteristics, all but the 17 jewel have watches that would appear to fit better in one of the other series.

Cavatina came in traditional strap, cord or expansion (same watch, different band) with only a few integrated bands.  High-fashion appeared to be mostly integrated bands.  both Cavatina and High Fashion were mostly dress watches.  Petites were  on 1/2' straps, round dials with round or tonneau cases, a bit sportier, or more everyday. The 17 jewel was round, generally smaller than the other styles, and with an 11/32 or 13/32 strap.

I noticed that you tried to move [[Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising]] to &quot;Advance Wars&quot; by blanking the first page and copy-pasting the content to the second page. I have reverted (undone) this move, because of some problems with the move, among them that you never moved the talk page.

Before trying to move a page again, I suggest that you study the page [[Help:Pages#Moving]]. Also, I suggest that you become more familiar with Wikibooks before you move any pages.

If you have more questions about Wikibooks, you could read [[Help:Contents]], or you could ask me by posting to [[User talk:Kernigh]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:26, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

Hello, welcome to Wikibooks!

You seem new... Someone put your book, [[Gross-out songs]], at [[Project:votes for deletion|votes for deletion]]. You just created this book today, and normally we can only vote when modules are at least one week old.

However, I am sure that this wiki, '''Wikibooks''', is the wrong wiki for this book. This is the reason why we are proposing to delete it before one week. You might want to read '''[[Project:What is Wikibooks]]'''; this page explains what Wikibooks allows and allows not. This wiki is for ''instructional materials''; your song lyrics are ''fiction or literature'', and certainly do not belong here.

I am not sure where to move these song lyrics. I would like to know where you found the lyrics for [[Gross-out songs]]. How did you find the lyrics for &quot;The Black Cat Piddled&quot;, &quot;How Dry I Am&quot;, and all the others? --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:46, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Section 7.1 - Parallel Lines==
In Euclidean Geometry, lines are parallel if they do not intersect.&lt;/br&gt;
Remember that lines extend infinitely, if they are not parallel they will eventually intersect.

[[Image:Parallelle lijnen.png]]
===Exercises===
draw line AB, draw a line CD that is parallel to AB&lt;br/&gt;
find a way to prove that AB is parallel to CD

==Section 7.2 - Perpendicular Lines==
In Euclidean Geometry, lines are perpendicular if they intersect at a 90 degree angle.

[[Image:2D Cartesian Coordinates.svg|thumb]]
===Exercises===
Draw a line AB, then pick a point C on line AB, make a line which intersects C and is perpendicular to AB, i.e.,

&lt;math&gt;CD \perp AB&lt;/math&gt;

prove that line CD is perpendicular to AB.

==Section 7.3 - Circles==

===Circles===

===Congruent Circles===
Congruent circles are circles that have the same size, that is, the same radius.

[[Image:Congruent Circles.jpg]]

====Concentric Circles====
Concentric Circles share the same center, axis or origin with one inside the other. Concentric Circles do not necessarily have the same radius.

[[Image:Concentric Circles.jpg]]

===Exercises===
draw a circle, find a way to draw a congruent circle, prove they are congruent&lt;br/&gt;
draw a circle, then draw a concentric one, prove that they are concentric.

===Radius, Diameter, Chord===
A radius is a line segment connecting a point on the circle and the center of the circle.&lt;br/&gt;

[[Image:Radius.jpg]]

Diameter is a line segment connecting 2 points on the circle and goes through the center.&lt;br/&gt;

[[Image:Diameter.jpg]]

A chord is a line segment connecting 2 points on the circle that does not have to go through the center. The diameter of a circle is the longest chord.

[[Image:Chord.jpg]]

==Section 7.4 - Quadrilaterals==

A quadrilateral is defined as any 4 sided polygon. This means squares, rectangles, etc. are all called quadrilaterals. In the following sections we will take a closer look at each of the important quadrilaterals, how they are defined, and some special properties of each of them.

===Rectangles===
A Rectangle is defined by having 4 conditions. The first is that it is a 4 sided polygon. The second is that it has 2 pairs of parallel sides. The third is that the pairs of parallel sides are of equal length. The forth is that all angles must be equal to 90 degrees or a right angle. &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Lets take an example. Below is a Rectangle. First we note that it has 4 sides, and that they form a polygon, this makes it a 4 sided polygon so the first condition is satisfied. Next we notice that 2 of the sides are parallel to each other and that the other 2 sides are parallel to each other, thus the second condition has been meet. Now we notice that the pairs of parallel sides are of equal length, thus the third condition has been meet. The final condition was that all angles must be 90 degrees, as shown in the image they are in fact 90 degrees. Because all 4 conditions have been meet we now know that the polygon below is in fact a Rectangle.&lt;/br&gt;

[[Image:Rectangle1.jpg]]

&lt;/br&gt;
====Special Properties====
&lt;/br&gt;
Ok, now that the rectangle has been defined we need to know whats so special about rectangles. &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
'''Length of a diagonal:'''&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Below is the same rectangle as above except it has the diagonal drawn from 1 vertex to the other. The length of this diagonal is equal to the square root of one side squared added to the length of the adjacent side squared. e.g. &lt;math&gt; \sqrt(3^2 + 1^2) = \sqrt(10) = 3.162 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/br&gt;

[[Image:Rectangle2.jpg]]

&lt;/br&gt;
The proof of this is quite simple. But first you have to know the pythagorean theorem so read over this if you don't already know it.&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;/br&gt;
1) Angle ABC = 90 degrees - given in the definition of a rectangle.&lt;/br&gt;
2) Side AB and side BC and the diagonal form a triangle. - a 3 sided polygon&lt;/br&gt;
3) The triangle is also a right angled triangle because it has a right angle in it. - angle ABC&lt;/br&gt;
4) The diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle.&lt;/br&gt;
5) the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the sides - Pythagora's theorem&lt;/br&gt;
6) thus the diagonal is equal to &lt;math&gt; \sqrt(b^2 + c^2) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Following this property we can note that if we draw a diagonal we create 2 congruent triangles inside the rectangle.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
proof:&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
below is such a Rectangle with the diagonal drawn. We shall name the vertices A, B, C, D. The diagonal is called AC because the 2 endpoints are A and C. The 2 triangles are ABC and ADC. &lt;/br&gt;
[[Image:Rectangle2.jpg]]
&lt;/br&gt;
1) The 2 triangles share the a side - AC.&lt;/br&gt;
2) AD and BC have an equal length - given.&lt;/br&gt;
3) angles ABC and ADC are of equal measure - definition of a rectangle.&lt;/br&gt;
4) Each triangle has an angle of equal measure - statement 3.&lt;/br&gt;
5) by the side angle side theorem each triangle is congruent.&lt;/br&gt;

====Examples====

===Square===
A square has the same properties as a rectangle except that all 4 sides must be equal length. A square is also considered a rhombus, kite, parallelogram, and trapezoid.
====Special Properties====
====Examples====

===Trapezoid===

A Trapezoid is a quadrilateral with 2 sides that are parallel.

[[Image:Trapez 01.png|thumb]]
====Special Properties====

Area for a trapezoid is given by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;A= h\frac{a + b}{2}.&lt;/math&gt; , where a and b are the lengths of the 2 parallel sides and h is the height.
====Examples====
&lt;1=

===Rhombus===
A Rhombus is a quadrilateral with four equal sides.

[[Image:Rhombus (polygon).png|thumb]]


====Special Properties====
The area of a Rhombus is given by the formula: 

&lt;math&gt;Area=\frac{D_1 \times D_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; where D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the lengths of the two diagonals

Because the rhombus is a parallelogram, the area also equals the length of a side (B) multiplied by the perpendicular distance between two opposite sides(H)

&lt;math&gt;Area=B \times H&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The area also equals the square of the side multiplied by the sine of any of the interior angles:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Area={a^2 \sin\theta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

where a is the length of the side and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between two sides.

====Examples====

===Parallelogram===
A Parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two sets of parallel sides.
[[Image:Parallelogram measures.svg|thumb]]
====Special Properties====
The Area of a parallelogram: 
:&lt;math&gt;A = B \times H&lt;/math&gt; 
:where B is the Base and H is the Height

The Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

      <comment>/* Symmetrical Polynomials */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this module we will discuss how symmetrical polynomial have special relationships with their roots. This characteristics make it easier to find the roots of a symmetrical polynomial or multiply factors together.

==Symmetrical Polynomials==
In mathematics a polynomial is considered to be symmetrical if you take the roots of the original polynomial and then interchange any root with another root, the polynomial will remain the same. For example the polynomial &lt;math&gt;8x^3 + 16x^2 - 22x - 30&lt;/math&gt; is symmetrical because its factorized form is &lt;math&gt;(2x - 3)(2x + 2)(2x + 5)&lt;/math&gt; and if you interchange the roots the resulting polynomial will be the same. However the polynomial &lt;math&gt;4x^3 + 12x^2 - 7x - 30&lt;/math&gt; is not symmetrical because it factorized form is &lt;math&gt;(2x - 3)(x + 2)(2x + 5)&lt;/math&gt; and if you interchange the roots the resulting polynomial will be &lt;math&gt;4x^3 + 18x^2 - 16x - 30&lt;/math&gt; if you switch the 2 and the 5 around.

==Roots Of Quadratic Polynomial==
If we need to find the roots of a given quadratic function we have two formulae that can help us to find the roots of a quadratic equation.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta\,&lt;/math&gt; be the roots of &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta = - \frac{b}{a},\quad \alpha\beta = \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Example===
Find the values of a and b of the equation &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx - 48\,&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta = 6\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta = -16\,&lt;/math&gt;.
#First we need to find the value of a and b, we use the relationships of the roots to find a and b.
##&lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta = -16 = \frac{-48}{a}\,&lt;/math&gt; from this we can determine that a = 3
##&lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta = 6 = -\frac{b}{a}\,&lt;/math&gt;
#Now that we have determined that a = 3 we can write the second relationship as:
#:&lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta = 6 = -\frac{b}{3}\,&lt;/math&gt; so we can determine that b = -18
# Now we can write the complete equation.
#:&lt;math&gt;3x^2 -18 x - 48\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Roots Of Cubic Equations==
If we need to find the roots of a given cubic function we have three formulae that can help us to find the roots of a cubic equation.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;border: solid 1px #0099ff; background: #ddeeff; padding: 0.5em; width: 75%;&quot;&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt; be the roots of &lt;math&gt;ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\sum\alpha = - \frac{b}{a},\quad \sum\alpha\beta = \frac{c}{a},\quad \alpha\beta\gamma = -\frac{d}{a} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Where: &lt;math&gt;\sum\alpha = \alpha + \beta + \gamma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And: &lt;math&gt;\sum\alpha\beta = \alpha\beta + \alpha\gamma + \beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
===Example===
In this example we consider the special case of  the cubic &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 21x^2 + cx + 280=0&lt;/math&gt;, where c is to be determined and we are given the additional information this its 3 roots are in [[A-level_Mathematics/C2/Sequences_and_Series#Arithmetic_Progression_.28AP.29|arithmetic progression ]]. Thus we can write the roots in the form p, p + q, p - q. Also factorize the equation.&lt;p&gt;
#First to find p we use the &lt;math&gt;\sum\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
#:&lt;math&gt;\sum\alpha = p + (p + q) + (p - q) = -\frac{21}{1}&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;\sum\alpha = 3p = -21&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;p = -7\,&lt;/math&gt;
#Then we need to find the value of q.
#:&lt;math&gt;-7(-7+q)(-7-q)= -\frac{280}{1}&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;7q^2 - 343= -280\,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;7q^2= 63\,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;q^2= 9\,&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;q= 3\,&lt;/math&gt;
#Now we can write out our roots.
#: (-7 - 3),-7,(-7 + 3)
#: -10,-7,-4
#We can now find c.
#:&lt;math&gt;\sum\alpha\beta = -7\times-4 + -7\times-10 + -10\times-4 = \frac{c}{1}&lt;/math&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;138 = c\,&lt;/math&gt;
#The complete equation is &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 21x^2 + 138x + 280=0&lt;/math&gt;
#Finally we write out the factorized equation.
#&lt;math&gt;(x + 7)(x+4)(x+10)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Simple Substitution of Roots==
If you increase each root in a polynomial equation by the number n, you can calculate the resulting equation by replacing each x term in the original polynomial equation with (x - n). This leads to [[A-level_Mathematics/C2/Sequences_and_Series#Binomial_expressions|binomial expansion]] so make sure that you are well versed in it.

===Example===
Suppose that the cubic equation &lt;math&gt;x^3+x^2-22x-40 = 0\,&lt;/math&gt; has roots &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,, \beta\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;. Find a cubic equation with the roots &lt;math&gt;\alpha - 2\,, \beta- 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma -2\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
#If &lt;math&gt;x=\alpha-2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\alpha=x+2&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a root of the original equation you can replace each x term with x + 2:
#:&lt;math&gt;\left(x+2\right)^3+\left(x+2\right)^2-22\left(x+2\right)-40 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
#Using [[A-level_Mathematics/C2/Sequences_and_Series#Binomial_expressions|Binomial Expansion]] we can easily find the terms.
#:&lt;math&gt;\left(x^3+6x^2 + 12x + 8\right)+\left(x^2+4x+4\right)-22\left(x+2\right)-40 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
#Finally we combine all the terms and we have:&lt;p&gt;
#:&lt;math&gt;x^3 + 7x^2 -6x -72\,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Vision, Goals and Objectives for'''&lt;br/&gt;
'''Georgia's Statewide Water Resources Management Plan'''



===Vision Statement===

''&quot;Georgia manages water resources in a sustainable manner to support the state’s economy, to protect public health and natural systems, and to enhance the quality of life for all citizens.&quot; ''   
:[http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/index.html Policy statement] from the [[Georgia Water/Georgia Comprehensive State-wide Water Management Planning Act|Comprehensive Statewide Water Management Planning Act]] signed by Governor Sonny Perdue on May 13, 2004.

====Procedure for defining the vision====
The vision statement above was provided in the final report of the [[Georgia Water/Georgia Joint Comprehensive Water Plan Study Committee|Joint Comprehensive Water Plan Study Committee]] and then incorporated into the Comprehensive State-wide Water Management Planning Act.  &quot;This vision encompasses the concept of sustainability that has never been articulated in earlier goals. It also recognizes the interrelationship of the economy, environmental quality, and quality of life.&quot;[http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/why_comprehensive_water_plan.pdf]


===Goals and Objectives===

The statements of goals and objectives for the statewide water plan are quoted below, from EPD document [http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/documents/req_info.html] of November 23, 2005, posted on Georgia Water Council website.  

'''Goals'''  -  &quot;The comprehensive water management plan will be drafted to meet two overarching goals:

# protect public health and environmental quality, and
# meet future needs while protecting aquifers, instream uses and downstream users&quot;

'''Objectives'''  -  &quot;To accomplish these goals we will focus on four management objectives:

:* Minimize withdrawals of water by increasing water conservation and reuse;
:* Maximize returns to the basin of origin through policies that address interbasin transfers, on-site sewage disposal systems, and land application of treated wastewater where water quantity is limited;
:* Meet instream and off stream demands for water through efficient surface storage, aquifer management and reducing water demands; and
:* Protect water quality by reducing pollutant loadings from discharges and runoff from the land to ensure the assimilative capacity of the streams is not exceeded and aquatic life is not impaired.&quot;

The new water policy tools (revised laws) to be developed for aiding the state comprehensive plan will be conceived and organized around these four water management objectives. [http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/summary060705.pdf]


====Procedure for defining the goals and objectives====
'''Goals'''  -  A similar (slightly reworded) goals statement was given by Carol Couch at the first [Georgia Water Council] meeting on March 2, 2005 (see online [http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/documents/summary030205.html meeting notes]). &lt;br/&gt;

'''Objectives''' -  The list of four management objectives was given in a [http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/why_comprehensive_water_plan.pdf presentation] by Jim Kundell at the second [[Georgia Water/Georgia Water Council|Georgia Water Council]] meeting on June 7, 2005.  At this meeting, Carol Couch reiterated the statements of goals and four objectives, and asked for the Council's concurrence, which was given.[http://www.georgiawatercouncil.org/pdf_files/summary060705.pdf]

'''Kombdi Vade''' is a Malvani dish, which is quite popular in Maharashtra. The dish consists of the traditional Malvani [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] curry (including chicken pieces with bones), vade (also known as puri, which is a fluffy, fried bread of wheat and nachni flour), onion, lemon and solkadhi (a drink made from coconut milk).

==Ingredients==
*800 [[Cookbook:g|g]] (1.8 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]) or 8 medium sized pieces of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]] grated
*4 [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] chopped
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:chilli|Chilli Powder]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsps]] [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsps]] Malvani Special Masala
*8 [[Cookbook:Green chilly|green chillies]] chopped
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] paste
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] paste
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs]] oil
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
*finely chopped coriander leaves for garnishing

==Procedure==
#Grind half of the green chillies to a paste and mix it well with the ginger and garlic pastes. 
#Make cuts on the chicken pieces, rub this mixture on to them well and marinate for about an hour at least.
#Roast coconut shavings in a little hot oil till light brown. Cool and grind along with half the onions to a paste.
#Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan and sauté the onions on medium level for about 2  minute(s) or till they are light brown in color.
#Add the remaining chopped green chillies, spice powders and fry for a few seconds. Add the marinated chicken pieces and fry on medium level for about 3  minutes or till they are lightly browned.
#Add the paste, salt and mix well. Add water according to the desired level of consistency and bring to a boil. Cover and cook on low level for about 25  minute(s) or till the chicken pieces are tender and fully cooked.
#Garnish with finely chopped coriander leaves. 

==Notes, tips and variations==

If it is difficult to obtain fresh coconut, it can be replaced by desiccated coconut shavings. For this recipe, there is no need to soak it in warm water. Roast it directly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Best practices in public participation are described here, with links to current examples where these exist.

==Goal of Public Participation==


==Public Participation Program==

=== Design of the Public Participation Program ===

=== Level of Public Participation ===

* [http://lithgow-schmidt.dk/sherry-arnstein/ladder-of-citizen-participation.html A Ladder of Citizen Participation] - describes levels of allowed citizen involvement in the decision process. 
* [http://web.archive.org/web/20050624160252/http://www.lwa.gov.au/downloads/publications_pdf/PF010167.pdf Citizen Juries] -  &quot;A citizens' jury brings together a group of 16 or so randomly chosen citizens as jurors and provides a forum in which the jurors can consider how best to deal with an issue of public importance. ....jurors are given detailed, balanced information about the issue, hear a wide range of views from witnesses, and are able to question these witnesses as well as seek out any additional information they might want.&quot; 

===Notification of Meetings===
*The State maintains a website which is &quot;a central point for meeting notices for all state government boards, commissions and task forces. People who are interested in any of the boards can sign up with the secretary of state to be notified by e-mail when the boards are meeting.&quot; [http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/mld/ledgerenquirer/news/local/13486347.htm]  &lt;br/&gt;
:Example - [https://www.sos.state.al.us/generalpublic/publicdefault.aspx/ Alabama Open Meetings Law]
*The State requires each state government board, commission and task force to post on the website the following information (as a condition for its continued authorization):
:#Name of board, commission or task force
:#Authorization for its creation and continuation
:#Statement of duties
:#List of members, their organizations, how appointed, and terms of appointment
:#Officers of the organization, how selected, and terms of office
:#List of all meetings, with dates and locations
:#Minutes for each meeting
:#Schedule for future meetings, with dates and locations
:#Contact information with telephone, email address and postal address
:#How to be added to the mailing lists.

===Enabling Participation in Planning Steps===


===Review and Comment on Draft Documents===
*Website which allows readers to post comments online for all to see. [http://www.georgiaplanning.com/rdis/discussion/default_v2.asp?forum=Water%20Conservation%20Plan Good example]:  Georgia Department of Community Affairs, comments on draft water conservation program.
*Website which allows readers to record their approval/disapproval for list of proposed changes.  Note that even better approach is to allow readers to define the proposed changes to be included on the online survey form.  [http://www.georgiaplanning.com/rdis/discussion/default_v2.asp?forum=Water%20Conservation%20Plan Example:]  Georgia Department of Community Affairs website to gather public response to proposed program changes.

This is more of a suggestion:  If you are creating original supplimental templates and other &quot;tools&quot; for this Wikibook, you should try (when reasonable) to keep it within the namespace of this project.  The above templates are probabaly going to be just fine, but the point is that you want to avoid namespace collisions with other Wikibooks, who may also have similar named items.  It is perfectly fine to have five or six &quot;modules&quot; in Wikibooks to have the same name, and even cover the same material.  Since they would be in seperate Wikibooks, the namespace allows the content to be seperated.

How you've named the articles and subsections is perfectly reasonable... I'm just trying to point out that you do need to step a little more carefully on Wikibooks if you don't stick to the common namespace of the Wikibook.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 08:11, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:Gotcha. I didn't really realize that could be done. So templates should be created as &lt;nowiki&gt;Template:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/TemplateName&lt;/nowiki&gt;? Since it's early in the book I might just convert things. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 23:49, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

:Why do you describe this as a childrens book? If you travel on the London underground right now HBP is likely the most common book you will see being read by adults. very much more common than any other single book. The 'adult covers' were supposedly introduced for adults too embarassed to be seen rereading the childrens cover version. I am sure more adults will have read these books than most 'adult' books in existence. Also note that for whatever reason, content has become steadily more 'adult' as the series has progressed.[[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 08:09, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

::The Harry Potter books are children's books. Rowling has said it herself. It's important to accompany several reader ages. Wikijunior is a secondary goal for now; we need to develop the general content first. I reworded the standards to not be so heavy on 'children' nonetheless. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 13:20, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
:::I begin to wonder if JKR had a plan to write a set of books intended to be read one book each year as you grow up. This would still make them childrens books, but certainly breaking into adults at the top end. Aside from that, surely the definition is not what the author intended, but what really happened. These books were originally rejected by many publishers, because they did not fit the pattern for childrens books. How many of these books are being read by adults for themselves, how many by children for themselves. An awful lot of quite expensive books just got sold. Who forked out for that, and why? Which group is most likely to become fanatical enough to want to find out more here, so what will the readership here be? But yes, I would agree it would be correct to bear in mind that some readers might be quite young.[[User:Sandpiper]]8/8/2005

:what is appropriate usage for spoiler warnings in character descriptions? Presently it is one article per character, so where should spoilers go? A summary article about a character might contain very basic information (like their death in book 6, say) which would be a very big spoiler for book 1. So should 'character articles have a blanket spoiler warning?[[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 09:07, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

::Do not reveal any significant information in the biography. That section is for simple character attributes. Beginners should only see the biography. All but one of the following sections are for intermediate readers. The last section, &quot;Greater Picture,&quot; is for advanced readers only. Please see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Severus Snape]] for the template you should use. It would be great if you could enforce this policy on all the other character pages. This book must stay away from being a Macropedia and really focus on the analysis. Your commentary so far looks great. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 13:37, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

:::hmm, still tricky. I think it may be hard to describe a section as 'biography' if you can not include what would normally be main biographical details, because they would be spoilers. Maybe the heading needs amending somehow? Yes, I can see how it would work with a description of the characters appearance, manner, general affiliations, etc, but this is not precisely biography. 
:::The piece I wrote into Snape includes some analysis, drawing in the bit from the prevous book. (memory of exact events there is rather less clear in my head, or i might have added the section in the relevant book, I will eventually). From what you say, you might conside this more appropriately included in general analysis (advanced). Or do you envisage that general will include things which are very hard to precisely pin down from the text, where maybe only a set of possible interpretations can be identified? The issue I described is still the subject of great debate, though the majority I have seen is tending the way I wrote it here (2:1?). This may prove to be a significant spoiler for book 7, though I would hope that JKR knows this and has already planned how she will maintain reader interest despite her own clues. [[user:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 16:13 bst 8aug 2005 (appologies this keyboard has no tilde).

::::I renamed the first section to &quot;Attributes.&quot; Here is what I planned for the sections:
:::::Attributes: general descriptive statistics. A small amount of text about how the character looks, acts, etc. No analysis (i.e. looks, demeanor, main activities and occupation).
:::::Role in the Books: details of the character's actions in the book. Still, no analysis. This is still the descriptive phase of the page (i.e. killed X in Book 5).
:::::Strengths and Weaknesses: some analysis on where the character has faults, etc. Beginning of inserting facts to back up character statements (i.e. has trouble with confidence, crafty).
:::::Relationships with Other Characters: interactions with other characters and the character's stance on others. Personal referencing (i.e. affectionate towards Y).
:::::Analysis: general analysis on the character. Whereas the Role section covered ''how'' the character acted, this covers ''why'' the character acted. Some content here can tie in with relationship analysis the section above (i.e. X feels at home when at Y and feels a great sense of protectiveness over it).
:::::Questions: reflection questions for the reader. Made to help the reader gain insight on the character (i.e. does this character really care about X?).
:::::Greater Picture: present on many other pages, this is the true &quot;tie-in&quot; section. It points out what the character is likely to do / how likely to act. Point out future controversy and where the role of the character is headed, especially in reference to other characters (i.e. X is likely to go after Y in Book 7 due to his infatuation with Z. After Z's death this damaged X greatly).
::::-[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 17:06, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
::::: Attributes sounds a bit clinical, or more to do with dungeons and dragons than people. 'Background', 'History', 'Overview'? something indicating that this is general information, and indeed might vary quite a bit from character to character.[[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 22:50, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
::::::Let's just go with &quot;Overview&quot; then. That'll work. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 22:53, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

::I would think that the general spoiler template should only be used on plot pages. That keeps its use to only the Books section. Any other sections will be sufficiently flagged using the Beginner and Intermediate spoiler templates. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 14:03, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

== VfD Discussion ==

While I think this version of the guide has been modified sufficiently to perhaps justify why it should be a Wikibook, I dislike how this was added to avoid the link to the Wikibook [[Harry Potter plots]] that is going through a VfD discussion.  The two are linked together, and frankly the discussion on the VfD page, as it is mostly positive, is going to serve as a justification to keep this Wikibook here rather than something to drag it down.  The Harry Potter plots page can be removed with a speedy delete comment (&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;) once you get everything to where you want it to be at.  Please don't try to really muddy up the discussion by starting a new Wikibook instead, and you could have done a page move to the eariler content without really mucking things up.

Still, I like the direction this is going.  My comment about deleting duplicate content from Wikipedia is still valid, and it should go.  Links to Wikipedia are fine and even encouraged.  I'm not trying to bite too hard, and the reason for the VfD is simply to close out the discussion for once and all.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:56, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

:I think I answered what you say above on the VFD page. I don't believe this book was created to avoid anything. I believe it was created to show how a proper book should be formed. The book was discussed right in the VFD discussion. I have no problem with Harry Potter plots being deleted now that the Muggles' guide provides for it. I hope this Guide really works well; I think I'll be spending a lot of time at Wikibooks now. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 19:52, 3 August 2005 (UTC)

== Structuring ==

This is a request to anyone who wants to leave comments on how this book should be structured. This book is VFDed at the moment, mainly I think because it is seen as becoming a Macropedia. I see this guide as a reference textbook to the series. I think the sections that exist now should stay and be developed with specific attention towards analysis of whatever the article is talking about. Wikipedia has some descriptions but I think this book should have both descriptions and analysis. While NPOV is important on Wikipedia, I believe some analysis and angling should occur here at the book, especially with characters. So, my questions, specifically to maybe admins or other big editors here:

*'''How should a reference textbook be approached when it has some connection to being a Webopedia?''' It is important to have lots of distinct detailing (i.e. why wasn't the [[Wikijunior_Solar_System|Solar System book]]'s [[Wikijunior_Solar_System/Moon|page on the moon]] structured as &quot;read the Wikipedia article for details on the Moon, here are some questions?&quot;). I'd like to have lots of sections on specific things. Analysis is also included, but the structuring is like a Webopedia. Are critical commentary and questions about the section a good thing to include? How does a guidebook get down to details and not be encyclopaedic?
*'''How should Wikipedia content be moved here?''' A lot of Wikipedia pages go into a lot of depth. A book seems more appropriate for such depth. Also, some details should be shared between the two projects, especially character biographies. Can that be a copy?
*'''What should a book's TOC be structured as when it is mostly a reference and analysis text?''' I realize the importance of an index. How should the above mentioned and already created categories be organized if they stay in the book?

Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 14:23, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

----

One thing I'd like to point out with Wikijunior (as opposed to the other Wikibooks) is that it is sort of a Wikipedia for younger kids.  At some point in the future it has been suggested that Wikijunior is going to get its own server and be entirely on its own.  The whole project was kinda forced upon Wikibooks by the foundation (there was some sort of grant in it for about $20,000 that went to the foundation as well... paying for the server you are currently using with some additional funding coming from a few other sources).  So what I'm trying to suggest is that Wikijunior books really don't compare to the rest of Wikibooks in terms of policies.  Especially since Wikijunior has its own complete set of policy guides (like a really bizzare one of no expansion or new book ideas unless agreed upon by the &quot;community&quot;...or even new article ideas for that matter... I've pushed it quite a bit on the Solar System.)  IMHO it should have been done on meta first, but instead it has been done through Wikibooks.

I think if this Wikibook is done properly, it can become '''the standard''' to compare other literary study guides.  I'm sure you could get creative if you ''had'' to make this on a more literary format, but I don't think that is strictly necessary.  How far you would like to go on the deconstruction of the plots and characters of the Harry Potter series is also debatable.  I'm also curious how much comparison/contrast between the books and the cinema versions has been done?  I'm sure you can find it at fan sites, but Wikibooks would allow you to organize it in a much better manner.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:57, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

== Unite with the Harry Potter WikiProject ==
I think it would be a good idea to run this Wikibook from the [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Harry Potter|Harry Potter WikiProject]].  It's not a closed project; anyone here has a voice there.  Instead of Harry Potter fans being split into dozens of small enclaves, we'd help to create a single place for Harry Potter fans from all Mediawiki sites to meet.  We could then set joint Wikipedia and Muggles' Guide consensus on what subjects deserve a Wikipedia article and how in-depth it should be, as well as provide visible links to the longer, more in-depth articles here.  This would do a lot to direct fans' energies here and build this up, and it would also help soothe the Wikipedians against &quot;fancruft&quot;. &amp;mdash; [[User:131.230.133.185|131.230.133.185]] 05:27, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
:Info on this book has been posted there for some time. I hope some people will actually come over to help. Book summaries are already linked but more more content needs to be. A big issue (and I'm sure the Harry Potter Wikipedia contributors will get annoyed by this) is Transwiking the inappropriate Wikipedia content here. Over time that should happen. Harry Potter Wikipedia pages are really pushing what an encyclopedia should address and the Guide seems a more appropriate place for in depth coverage and analysis of the storyline. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 05:43, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
:If wikipedia is not going to accept detailed descriptions and analysis, then it is hard to see how they can be transferred from here to there. It sounds more like this will become the main source of in-depth information, with 'pedia only as an entry point.[[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 09:03, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

I note there is a flag on 'pedia Potter requesting people to port information over to here. Is there policy on what to do with it when it arrives? I guess I mean, take it as a gift to start the articles, then amend it as appropriate? This is beginning to sound a little schizophrenic. People will have a choice of two articles on each topic in different wikis. [[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 20:21, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

:Some things on Wikipedia are pushing what an encyclopedia should contain and should be ''Transwikied''. '''Appropriate''' material could be moved over if the HP Wikipedia community has a concensus that it is a good idea. I wouldn't want trash coming over here. I expect (and will definitely enforce) quality in this book. There definitely won't be two copies of things; Wikipedia would do its job with explaining the proper amount of information and Wikibooks would handle critical commentary. Copying from Wikipedia is a definite no. Only Transwikied material can come here. Even if they try to Transwiki, Wikibooks has to accept it. The community seems large enough that people will agree to the right things. Anyone doing the Transwiking will need to know both Wikipedia and Wikibooks policies. Since I've gotten into some decent discussions with Wikibooks people over in VFD, I'll probably attempt doing it when the time comes, if ever. The content might just get wiped off Wikipedia if it's garbage and we don't want it here at all. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 20:38, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
:: I think that has left me even more confused. I saw the tag on 'pedia asking people to copy articles (eg an article about a particular character) over here. As far as I can see, just copy and paste onto an edit box here and it is done. Then it would be a question of reorganising the information for here. That is not about officially transferring a page, rather about putting something on the large number of blank pages here. It is very much easier to take a piece of existing text and reorganise it. Some HP pedia articles have struck me as rather good, though others have definite factual errors (though I would not claim to be able to precisely correct them without a deal of checking). 
::What about pictures? Obviously the pictures show film actors and are just one interpretation of characters, but they do liven up a page.[[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 20:24, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
:::Anyone who starts moving things needs to follow the rules. If people start moving articles we'll get into the politics then. As for images, if those movie characters seem fitting, I think it would be fine to put them in the page. You'll have to edit the template but that's not difficult. This book isn't about the movies, but there should be some visual representation and the drawings people make are almost always horrible. Movie photos are probably the best choice. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 20:53, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== Book and Chapter Analysis ==

I think the creation of sub-pages for each chapter is fine, but I also think an overview is needed to orient the reader as to the main plot. This would not necessarily mention every chapter, but really should give a decent synopsis. Pedia is going the way of being very terse in its descriptions and will not fill the needs of someone who wants to spend half an hour and become a dinner party expert.

I noticed that chapter pages do not have a last/next link. One is needed! [[User:Sandpiper|Sandpiper]] 23:08, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

:There's an &quot;Overview&quot; section on the book pages now. Regarding last/next, that will come once organizational changes come to a stop and pages stabilize. Chapters will surely stay the same, but a lot of last/next page business can be added to make the book more booklike once things calm down. For now things are changing too much. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 23:21, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

== Unnecessary pages? ==
Some of the pages on the &quot;magic&quot; section seem unnecessary. I think it would be better to split the magic page into 5 pages, one for each section. And after that, you put all the information on a single page.

I found this portal looking for another one to participate with, and I am more than willing to help. I have already begun, however I (unfortunatly) dont have a book right here in my face. Im in class. lol. I will though, like to help out, and  will help make the Muggles Guide to Harry Potter more accurate and resource-ful. Thanks alot. 
PS: the books that I use are in American English, so if something is inaccurate in the books because of language translations, please let me know. [[User:67.115.220.195|67.115.220.195]] 15:22, 22 February 2006 (UTC)
:Excellent that you want to help out. Please create a user account and add your name to the list of authors on the main page. Definitely make sure you understand how the pages are written (see above). Look at well-developed pages such as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter]] to see how to write things. Most importantly though is to get book chapter summaries written. I saw you edited some summaries. We need to get extended versions onto each chapter page (and remember the templates!). Also, I think American English is fine. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 03:14, 23 February 2006 (UTC)


== Chapter names ==

It has occurred to me that it might be useful to have chapter names, rather than just numbers, on the book overview page. Right now, for instance, we have nothing but the chapter numbers on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|this overview page]], but it would be easier to find the specific chapter needed if the chapter title was there as well. Granted, there might be some spoiler effect, but that would be only slight... and it's a lot easier to find a specific event from the chapter name, in my opinion. As a test, I've done this for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone.]] Thoughts? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 00:23, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
:Although new and different, I don't mind the new listing you have on Philosopher's Stone. As an addition, it might not be a bad idea to rename the pages as well. Making the list on the summary page will be easier with such a change. If no one objects, I can go through and move each page. Also, spoilers shouldn't need to be considered since they have been warned twice previously that going to book pages will give away information. That's why you don't see the warning on each chapter page as well. There should be a flow to all the pages (like a book) including the explanations of the reader levels, but perhaps only I really see it since I wrote them and we'll have to wait for the first version of the book as a PDF to show it (which maybe we can have the end of the year as a goal for that). When you structure a page think of how it would look in a book since that will be the final result. Some organizational changes may need to happen before we PDF the project. I'm thinking it will be several hundred pages. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 04:39, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
::I am a little concerned about changing the name of the chapter pages in the book, if only because it would take longer to type the link target when you're linking to a particular chapter. Of course, that's a trivial complaint... but it is true that the list on the summary page will be only in the one place, and there may be a much larger number of links to any given chapter. Additionally, wasn't there something somewhere about allowing transWiki linkage to specific chapters? That said... my purpose is, given that someone is looking for the story of &quot;Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback&quot;, it is a lot easier to find it in the list that is in PS now, than a simple bald &quot;Chapter 14&quot;.

== Prefects ==

There is a comment on the Index talkback that Prefects should be mentioned in the book. I agree, as it isn't immediately obvious what a Prefect is to the ordinary reader; but it also isn't magic by any means -- any school that runs on the English model will have prefects, mine did for instance. I would suggest possibly a sub-head below Major Events for School Offices, which would contain Pefects, Head Boy / Head Girl, and Quidditch team captain; this fits better than anything else, because Ron's becoming a prefect (e.g.) is a fairly serious event in the overall story. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 22:12, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
:After thinking about this for a while, I actually have created that subhead and started populating the article on Prefects at least. The other articles will follow as I have time. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 19:28, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

== Collaboration of the Month candidate ==

I've decided to nominate this Wikibook as a Collaboration of the Month candidate... in preparation to becoming a full Book of the Month candidate.  Seriously.  This content has gone a long way from when it was listed as a VfD back elsewhen, and has become one of the crown jewels for Wikibooks, and I want to thank everybody who has participated so far.  My intention here is that this is a book that could have some general interest contributions by ordinary Wikimedia users, and give this some additional exposure on the front page that it certainly deserves.

This content is also so close to being one of the best of Wikibooks that I also feel that a big push to help improve the content is really all that it needs, and is in fact one of the goals for the Collaboration of the month campaign.  More than just raw advertising, I think this is a book that truly deserves this sort of attention.

If you feel as I do that this book could use that sort of attention, please cast your vote on the current voting page for [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]] and let everybody know about this book that may be new to Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:46, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

== Collaboration? ==

This book still needs serious work. Before anyone even thinks of nominating it for BotM, there should definitely be another CotM. I fixed up a few articles just because I ran across them. Seriously, even the Voldemort article was grievously lacking! [[User:Jfingers88|Jfingers88]] 03:49, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
:This book will continue to need serious work for many months since its coverage is massive. It will not be long until this is the largest book on Wikibooks in my opinion.

== Inactive and Active Authors ==
I'm one of the active authors of this wikibook but erased from the listing because I haven't been contributing for a long time. I've contributing s far the Triwizard Tournament, Hogsmeade, St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry's academics, books of the wizarding world and the Ministry of Magic. What I want to say is, even the author hasnt been contributing for a long time, as long as he/she has contributed single article/ideas/whatever, he/she should never been erased from the lists of the author. Or if you want to emphasize who are actively and not actively contributing, just put it at the end of the uername. Hope you got my point. {{User|Hedwig0407}} 11:31, 26 September 2006 (UTC)
:You certainly aren't an active author here. The three names preceding you have formed a very nicely-organized and intelligent team that contributes great work and continues to do so in the present (although one of those three may soon be removed due to inactivity). Once this book is published, those three names will be the ones I list as authors of the book since those are the ones that have formed substantial contributions to the project. The line must be drawn somewhere. I have now titled the authors section &quot;Active Authors&quot; so that inactive and insignificant users can be removed in future situations if and when the time comes. That section is only meant to be a helpful guide for individuals who might want to contact current contributors and could possibly not even be listed in the official book at all. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 02:16, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

I propose either deleting each or merging minor characters in one article which is redirected to by the individual pages.  [[User:John Reaves|John Reaves]] 06:38, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
:You'd need to have some pretty fierce definition of what comprised a &quot;minor character&quot;. Pretty much any definition would have to have exceptions: Marcus Flint? He's in three books. Adrian Pucey? Two. Minor? Good question. If forced to decide, I'd say Marcus, no, Adrian, yes. Armando Dippet? No... needs an individual write-up. Bertha Jorkins? Strictly speaking, not in any books – when we first hear of her, she's dead – but she's a relatively major part of the set-up of book 4. Personally, I would be '''slightly opposed''' because of the problem of definition. Plus, JKR does have a habit of taking a  minor character and suddenly making him or her rather important: e.g. Arabella Figg. And we can't know which until it happens: e.g. Mark Evans. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 08:32, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
:I'd say base the def. on the length of the article and personal judgement.  If Rowling develops a character, then the article can then be developed, it's not hard to do.  The problem is that there are articles that have only one or two sentences.  [[User:John Reaves|John Reaves]] 08:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
::Sometimes that's a flaw in the article, rather than it being an actual minor character. But I see your point: if it can't be expanded beyond a single sentence, maybe it does belong on a dedicated minor characters page. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 18:50, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
:::Most of the time it's a flaw due to the person who created an essentially useless stub. There's nothing negative about having separate pages for characters and it's much easier to organize that way. At the least each individual should have an infobox which separate pages supply easily. This book will be made into one large page anyway (for printing) and having separate pages makes the design of the full book much easier as well since it becomes very modular.

::::Can't really be consistent, because for a lot of spells the nature of the spell depends on who is casting it.

== lmskiver's Writeup in DH chapter 36 ==

I am... impressed with this writeup. But I suspect that it is in the wrong place.

Rather than have it be in the Chapter 36 Greater Picture section, I think that a better place for it might well be in a separate section of its own, one that is linked in after the Epilogue. That should probably be done for each of the seven books in fact; I think that each book could benefit from a whole-book overview and a place in the series overview.

Any thoughts? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:49, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

:Now that the series is complete we will need to turn a lot of our attention to the Greater Picture sections once we get all the chapter summaries in. I like the idea of adding a &quot;overall analysis&quot; page of some sort a little bit below the chapter listing for each book page. Is there anything else we could add besides a book analysis page? Anything we should discuss for each book? Notable events perhaps? -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:00, 1 August 2007 (UTC)


I like Chazz's idea! It's actually what brought me to the Muggle Studies site in the first place. I had finsihed 7, and was trying to look at the Greater Picture (GP) of how each of the books played into each other, the overall themes and threads that linked one to next, and how succintly Rowling wove them!... I thought I find the shortcuts I needed in the GP section and was dismayed it was incomplete... I was searching for answers to why this? and not that? and what's the overall meaning? even, how does this relate to other literary giants like Tolkein &amp; Lewis? I wanted input from other sources to be convinced that I was really getting it! 

I found few insights online, so I was left to my own brain and long conversations with friends. Ironically, they are still catching up, but because of their questions about HP's development in Yr.5, and my trying to both explain and defend him, I had the brainstorm that erupted on your pages. Move it where you deem fit... I wasn't sure it belong here, but felt that it was important to share, for the same reasons I sought it out.  

I might add that my cadre' were all Christians... I could write a whole section on how JKR, accused of Wicca and occult promotion, has woven a tale that can be viewed positively from a Christian point of view... and I was confessedly nonplussed, since I was reading for sheer pleasure and wasn't looking for it, or expecting to find it!

::Right, I can likely handle this.

*reset

Now done. Looked like the write-up that lmskiver did could be broken into two pieces, character development and storyline analysis, so I put it into two sections. Also tweaked it a little... you know, editors, not happy until they've played with it. I may be wrong in how I've broken it up, but it feels all right to me at the moment... if anyone disagrees, please feel free to correct me.

:I renamed the page to Character'''s''' to be consistent and deleted the old redirect and such. I'll try to read the content sometime soon. Why Harry lived when Voldemort died didn't see too complex to me (I figured it's just the prophecy that &quot;neither can live while the other survives&quot; and once Harry's Horcrux is gone there's no real connection between the two anymore and Voldemort plain dies) but how exactly Harry survived the Avada Kedavra that destroyed his Horcrux is much more complex. Thoughts? Saying &quot;the Killing Curse just hit the Horcrux and not Harry himself&quot; seems incomplete. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 12:21, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

::The reason it's complex is because of the interrelation. The Elder Wand cannot harm Harry because it accepts Harry as its master -- contrary to the apparent path through history, it is not murder that defeats the bearer of the wand, but forcible removal of the wand, so the wand became Malfoy's, and Malfoy was defeated by Harry. (It was Malfoy's wand Harry was holding when he defeated Voldy. Presumably the Elder Wand recognizes the wand that stood against it, rather than the bearer.) At the same time, Harry can not be killed by Voldy because of the blood linkage -- as he is using Harry's blood, he provides that protection. Which seems far-fetched, Voldy certainly had Riddle blood in him, but he quite handily bumped off Tom Sr. back in '44 or so. Then again, Tom Sr. didn't care about Tom Jr., likely didn't even know he existed. So: Voldy's curse knocks Harry into the waystation, but it is then his option whether to go on or return; and if he goes on, taking Voldy with him, there will still be one Horcrux in Nagini to allow Voldy to return. I don't know whether the creature is meant to be Voldy's soul -- recall he too is knocked out when that curse hits Harry -- or the fragment that was in Harry, but I suspect the former; the fragment, being just a fragment, would have frayed and vanished. In the other direction, then, once the soul fragment is gone, the only thing allowing Voldy to continue to live is Nagini and his own soul; and Nagini snuffs it. There is still the blood link, but that is unidirectional: Lily did not die to save Voldy, did she? And the Elder Wand still believes Harry to be its owner because nobody has forcibly disarmed Harry since he nabbed Malfoy's wand. And therein lies the entire tale, as far as I have figured it out so far... any thoughts? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:01, 7 August 2007 (UTC)

:::On a separate note, I formatted the new book analysis pages to what I think is a good idea for expansion.

:: The reason for the replacement of relative links with absolute ones is part of the preparation for the print version of the book. The print version is created by first converting to PDF, and the PDF conversion script is not capable of handling relative links. As for the Shrieking Shack page, that was evidently overlooked by the automatic script, which means it may not be properly on the Contents page. I will correct that this afternoon.

: Yes; the simple reason for that is that they just don't work. If an absolute link of more than one level ends with a slash, the Wikibooks display code seems to think that means we've left out the final level and redlinks, looking for a page named &quot;[...]/PageName/&quot; (with an empty name).

:Okay -- there are three categories in which we are asked to rate things, and I think we may want to have separate conversations about each. I'll suggest that we should sign our comments in each subhead so we know who's talking.

=== Composition ===
:First is Composition. This is pretty much self-explanatory; level 1 is &quot;correct spelling and grammar&quot;, level 2 is &quot;good structure&quot;, and level 3 is &quot;consistent style&quot;. All pages are at level 1 now, and most of the ones I've worked on, and pretty much all of Raven's, are at level 2. I don't know if I can claim &quot;consistent style&quot; because I don't know what the style should be. This is where I would like to get help from Raven, in particular. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;
::All of our pages are highly structured and organized, so I don't think this one will cause much trouble. Almost all pages will receive a 3 in my opinion, and the small number of 2s will most likely due to the page being empty or unformatted. We tend to have very little spelling mistakes or grammar issues, so I think we don't need to worry about this since the existing frameworks have taken care of it already. Just make sure the page has our correct framework, the proper intro paragraph and detail infobox, and has content in the correct sections. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:01, 24 November 2008 (UTC)

:::I can certainly work with Chazz on the &quot;style consistency&quot;. This certainly seems a bit more abstract because, as Chazz pointed out, we don't know what the style should be, and everyone has an individual approach. Grammar and spelling are certainly good, and I'll defer to Chazz regarding grammar, as he's better at that, although there are US/UK differences, but I try to stick with the British style (which I have to guess at sometimes), as that reflects not only the books, the website. I've mainly been working on chapter analysis for all the books. I framed in the main points (as has Chazz), but I am now working on tying in the broader themes of the entire series.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 22:20, 30 November 2008 (UTC)

=== Accuracy ===
:Second is Accuracy. Level 1 is Acceptable, level 2 is Good / Average, and level 3 is Verifiable. The areas I have been writing, summaries and such, generally are at level 2, some to level 3. I don't know if we can say any of the analysis is actually verifiable, without talking to JKR herself, so it's a definition of the term I'd be looking for here. Oh -- and lack of vandalism fits in this category as well; vandalism is, by its nature, inaccurate. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;
::We might want to just shift the numbers around for our uses since we're working on fiction. Unless a brand new editor has added something I think we can assume 2 in most cases and 3 once another user has come across the detail. For instance, if a new user adds a supposed fact then that's really unreviewed or at a 0. We can pass by 1 and once a solid user like one of us comes in and adds a detail it will be treated as a 2. When another one of us passes through and verifies the reference then let's go with 3. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:05, 24 November 2008 (UTC)

:::&quot;Accuracy&quot; on the analysis sections does seem a bit trickier, as by its very nature, it is someone's interpretation of the author's work. Certainly there are facts associated with it that need to be accurate, and for the most part, we've achieved a good level of correct information combined with opinion. I agree with Withinfocus' suggestions.[[User:PNW Raven|PNW Raven]] ([[User talk:PNW Raven|talk]]) 00:04, 2 December 2008 (UTC)

=== Coverage ===
:Third is Coverage, level 1 is Acceptable, level 2 is Good/Average, and level 3 is Great. Again, the analysis is an area where there doesn't seem to be a clear idea of what the standard is. Can coverage be even Good if the analysis is lacking? I can write everything that Arthur Weasley did, but without analysis as to why, or information about how the author was building Arthur's character, can it be a good article? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;
::This is where I think we will have the most work. Not too many of our pages will have a 3 from the beginning. We can go through the same iterative process as the above section maybe. Undeveloped articles start of course at unreviewed or 0, we make a first pass which sets us at 1 (most of our pages can default to this), and then to go to 2 or 3 I think Chazz, Raven, or another seasoned editor needs to make some swoops on it. The Trio most likely represent 3s. Maybe a 2 shows significant detail, not much analysis but some, and overall a complete but not full-bodied page. A 3 can be all the final touches including Raven's copyediting and a full analysis / greater picture. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:09, 24 November 2008 (UTC)
:::I will suggest that the Trio are not at a 3 level yet. Hermione may be a 3 for coverage, though I think she needs more analysis and greater picture yet. Ron is definitely only a 2, and I suspect Harry is only a 1 -- I forget whether I've had the chance to give him the full treatment yet. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt;
::::On re-examination I find that Harry is about 1 on coverage, as is Ron, in my opinion. Hermione could be a 3, but I think she's closer to 2 as analysis is still a little scant.

:We could... but bear in mind that it is also wrong. Looking at [[Help:Article validation]] I see that what I had thought was level 1 is actually level 0; as an editor, rather than a reviewer, I can't even see level 4 in the drop-down boxes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The goal of resuscitation is to ensure that air goes into the body, to the lungs, and then through the blood to the body to give the baby the oxygen needed for life.  A successful newborn resuscitation requires preparation.  
Trained personnell and equipment to warm the baby, establish an airway, and give medicines should be available at the time of birth.

==Step 1: Warming==
* Heat loss occurs through: 
*# radiant loss (heat loss directly into the air), 
*# conduction (direct loss from contact between two solids), and 
*# convection (the loss of heat as water evaporates).
* A radiant heat source and warm blankets or towels are needed to warm and dry the baby.
* Premature babies with immature skin need to be gently wrapped in a watertight layer such as sterile plstic wrap to prevent convective heat loss.  If a newborn is vigourous, the mother's body and warmed blankets can be used to keep the baby warm.

==Step 2: Clear the Airway==
* Babies need to breathe air when they are born.
* While most babies will cough, cry, or breathe on their own, many need to have liquid cleared from their airway first.  
* A rubber bulb suction or vacuum suction can be used to suck liquid from the moth and nostrils.  A tube connecting to external wall suction should be set to less than 100 mm Hg to prevent damage to the baby's mouth tissue.
* The baby should be positioned with the head midline, slightly extended, to open the airway.

==Step 3: Breathing==
Most babies can safely breathe on their own or be ventilated with a face mask.

Once the airway is cleared, most babies breathe spontaneously.  If a baby does not breathe, the baby will need assisted ventilation to inflate the lungs.  Most babies can be easily ventilated with positive pressure bag-mask ventilation.  This requires a face mask that goes over the baby's mouth and nose. The mask should be connected to an air source with supplemental oxygen.  It is currently not known how much oxygen is best to give to babies after delivery. It is a topic of current [http://neonatal.rti.org/ neonatal research].

There are two situations, however, when it is safer to place a breathing tube into the baby's trachea.
# Meconium
#* A baby who is born through meconium needs to be assessed immediately.  
#* According to NRP guidelines, if the baby is not vigorous-- crying, with good tone, and with heart rate over 100-- the baby should be intubated and the trachea should be suctioned to clear meconium.  Once meconium is cleared, the tube can be removed. Then the baby can be stimulated to breath on it's own.
# Congenital_diaphragmatic_hernia 
#* In babies born with diaphragmatic hernias, an endotracheal tube should be placed so that the stomach does not fill with air. This would put pressure on the lungs and make ventilation difficult.

The baby's efforts to breath should be assessed at least every 15-30 seconds.  If the baby shows no effort, positive pressure breaths should be given to ensure that air is getting to the lungs.  The breaths should be about once per second. The pressure should be high enough to inflate the lungs and see the chest wall rise and fall.  Usually full term babies require a maximum pressure of 30 cm H20.

Babies who do not breathe on their own need to be carefully evaluated.  They may have a problem with their respiratory drive, or be effected by maternal medications, such as anesthesia or other drugs.  They may be septic, asphyxiated, or have neuromuscular problems.

==Step 4: Heart Rate==
The baby's heart rate should be monitored continuously.  If the heart rate drops below 80 beats per minute, it is important to ensure that the baby is being vetilated.  If the baby has a heart rate under 80 and has had adequate ventilation for 30 seconds, chest compresstions should be started to help circulate the blood.  If after 30 seconds of chest compressions and assissted ventilation the heart rate is still under 80, the baby would require epinepherine to increase the heart rate.  

Ventilation and circulation are essential for life.  Without ventilation and circulation of blood, a baby can have brain damage and may ultimately die. The goal of resuscitation is to prevent brain damage and death.  Adequate preparation and training are essential for anyone who will be involved in the care of newborn babies.

:&quot;If we can assign people to a category then that tells us things about those people, and as we saw with '''the busdriver example''' we couldn't function in a normal manner without using these categories; i.e. in the context of the bus.&quot;

Was the bus driver example replaced by the police/highway patrol example? If so, then the above also needs to be updated. If not, a more specific reference to the bus driver example would be helpful as it is not on the same page. [[User:Paul Pomeroy|Paul Pomeroy]] 22:11, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

==random quotes==
p. 461 &quot;In many respects, this has been the fate of &quot;the group&quot; in social psychology. With its focus on the individual, social psychology has had a difficult time accepting the group as a true member of the flock. Although the group has been a part of social psychology since the field's beginning (Triplett, 1898), it has occupied a rather tenuous position. Social psychologists have scoffed at the notion of a &quot;group mind&quot; (Le Bon, 1895/1960). Allport (1924) observed that nobody ever tripped over a group, an insult questioning the very existence of the group. The rejection of the group became so complete that Steiner (1974) entitled an article, &quot;What ever happened to the group in social psychology?&quot; For a time, the group was banished to the foreign lands of organizational psychology and sociology.
&quot;But the group could not stay a stranger for long. It wormed its way back into the fold, but its rebirth had a unique twist. Early definitions of the group described it as a unit consisting of several individuals who interacted with each other and occupied &quot;real&quot; space (Shaw, 1981). However, the born-again group was accepted into the domain of social psychology only as a cognitive representation, a figment of the mind. Instead of the individual being in the group, the group was now within the individual; Hogg and Abrams (1988) stated that &quot;the group is thus within the individual ...&quot; (p. 19).&quot;

p. 462 &quot;SIT became the springboard for new approaches to understanding stereotyping (Haslam, Turner, Oakes, McGarry, &amp; Hays, 1992; Ng, 1989; Spears, Oakes, Ellemers, &amp; Haslam, 1997), prejudice (Bagby &amp; Rector, 1992), ethnic violence (Worchel, 1999) and other forms of intergroup relations. The perspective was applied to a host of traditional social psychological issues such as interpersonal perception (Park &amp; Rothbart, 1982), minority influence (Clark &amp; Maass, 1988), and group productivity and social loafing (Worchel, Rothgerber, Day, Hart, &amp; Buttemeyer, 1998).&quot;
Every article I have read in these books has mentioned SIT and Tajfel; was that a requirement?  Has SP nothing else?

p. 463 &quot;Social identity theory presents individual identity as a point along a continuum ranging from personal identity on one end to social identity on the other end. One's identity at a specific time is represented by a single point on the continuum. A multitude of variables affect whether personal identity or social identity will be most salient, and which of the many group memberships will be most prominent on the social identity side of the equation. The conceptualization of social identity as being composed of group membership leads to the hypothesis that people discriminate in order to enhance the position of their ingroups relative to that of outgroups. The motivation behind this action is to create a positive social identity (Tajfel, 1978), reduce threats to self-esteem (Hogg &amp; Abrams, 1990; Long &amp; Spears, 1997), or reduce uncertainty (Hogg, 2000; Hogg &amp; Abrams, 1993).&quot;

p. 464 &quot;Our approach gives the group a clear role outside the cognitive structure of the individual. Although we do not deny that individuals hold mental representations of groups and that these representations can and do exert influence, we also argue that groups are entities that exist outside the person and exert real pressure. We suggest that group dynamics has interpersonal and intergroup components that cannot be ignored in the study of the relationship between individual and group. Although group activities have an impact on the identity of the individual member, the group must be examined within a true social paradigm.&quot;

p. 467 &quot;The disintegration of the group continues into the stage of decay. At this point, members may defect from the group. Scapegoating takes place and leaders are often blamed for group ills. The individual focus is accelerated, and the need for the group is questioned.
&quot;In some cases, the decay destroys the group and it ceases to exist. However, in many other cases, the group, albeit with a different set of members, begins the process of rebuilding. A distinct incident or threat may ignite the rebirth, or the rebuilding may be initiated by the collective actions of a subset of the members. Whatever the reason, the group enters again into the group identification stage, and the cycle of group development begins anew.&quot;
Why do they put everything into either stages or cycles?  Why can't things not progress and just be?

(1) Add section on leadership; (2) add section on Simmel's group dynamics, diffusion of responsibility, bystander apathy, etc. (3) retitle chapter &quot;Groups and social structure&quot;; (4) add section on status, master status, ascribed vs. achieved status, status sets, role strain and role conflict; (5) add more on Goffman; (6) add some basic stuff on bureaucracy from Weber. (7) add Milgram obedience experiment to conformity section; (8) add Stanford Prison Experiment; (9) a case could be made for introducing Weberian power and authority here, re leadership, and for instructors who don't have time for an entire unit on politics.[[User:Thomasfbrown|Thomasfbrown]] ([[User talk:Thomasfbrown|talk]]) 21:57, 3 November 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I was thinking about doing a small scripting tutorial of my past work, and was thinking about looking into creating an actual OOP edition of the script.  Anyone have any comments/ideas?
----
Please do.  I firmly believe in putting code out there for folks to learn by copy and paste (I sure learn a lot that way).  

On a related note, there are lots of tutorials and documents out there on various GM subjects, but they often lack one or more of the following modules:

&lt;li&gt; What the operation/function/script is for. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; More than one example of how it might be used. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Variations of use: (e.g. using an '''array''' with ds_queue, using an '''array''' with sprites, using an '''array''' with mouse events, etc.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A downloadable GM file to experiment with or study. &lt;/li&gt;

I like the definition on wikipedia for '''&quot;tutorial&quot;'''... It says that a tutorial should have: 
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt; ''A '''presentation of content''', usually with an example or examples, often broken up into discrete modules or sections.'' &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt; ''Some '''method of review''' that reinforces or tests understanding of the content in the related module or section.'' &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt; ''A '''transition to additional modules or sections''' that builds on the instructions already provided.  Tutorials can be linear or branching.'' &lt;/li&gt; 

''While many writers refer to a mere list of instructions or tips as a &quot;tutorial&quot;, this usage can be misleading...'' SOURCE: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutorial &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree with it.  The nice thing is, if you can't do all the work yourself, someone else will eventually come in and help out.
----
I'm considering writing a few tutorials in GML; where should I put them?  In particular, I'm working on a variation of 3D mouselook for flight games that makes the view controls behave consistently even when looking straight up.  This seems like it doesn't quite fit in the [[../Tough Topics|Tough Topics]] chapter; that chapter seems to be for troubleshooting rathar than tutorials.  Maybe there should be a section for tutorials, or a separate WikiBook for GM tutorials?
*i recommend you start it more of a programming aspect, and leave other gm articles(like mine) to provide an outline ;) also, i recommend more of a starters tut, not going straight in to the complicated things~~[[User:Antome|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#FF9900;font-size:10px;font:Arial;color:#FFFF00;padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt;Antome&lt;/span&gt;]] [[User talk:Antome|&lt;span style=&quot;background:#009900;font-size:9px;font:Arial;color:#00FF00;padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;]] 04:18, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Selecting, Planning, and Executing Your Eagle Service Project==

===Introduction===
The capstone to the entire process that a Scout undertakes from the very first day he becomes a Scout is one of the most daunting tasks that he will ever complete.  That task is the Eagle Scout Service Project.  As the Requirements for Eagle Scout rank state; 

''While a Life Scout, plan, develop, and give leadership to others in a service project helpful to your religious institution, school, or your community. (The project should benefit an organization other than the BSA.) The project idea must be approved by the organization benefiting from the effort, your unit leader (Scoutmaster, Varsity Scout Coach, Venturing crew Advisor), unit committee, and by the council or district advancement committee before you start. You must use this Eagle Scout Leadership Service Project Workbook, No. 18-927D, in meeting this requirement.''

Over the ten years since I attained Eagle rank in 1994, I have advised fellow Scouts, helped on their projects, spoken with their Scoutmasters, and even been a part of the Eagle Board of Review.  In that time, I have seen projects that were flawlessly executed, and I have seen projects where the young man most certainly did not do his best, nor was he prepared for the outcome.  

The Eagle Scout Project Workbook has been designed with the least details possible, opening up interpretation on the local Council or District level, and as any Scouter who has ever worked a District or Council Board of Review will tell you, this leads to a great deal of confusion and frustration on the part of the District or Council Boards of Review, Scoutmasters, and Scouts completing Eagle requirements.  In cases where our recommendations are contrary to those of your local Scouting district or council, we encourage you to follow what your local district or council advancement committee has established. 

This guide is designed for the Scout and the Scoutmaster, the parent and the benefiting organization head, and all those involved with the selection, planning, and execution of the Eagle Scout Service Project so that we all may benefit a little more from Scouting in the community.

===Before You Begin===
Most of these steps will be included in a future work describing the process to becoming an Eagle Scout.  I am including them here for your benefit, however.  In the future, they will be moved to another text entirely.  
*Be sure that you have enough time prior to your 18th birthday to continue.  Many a time, the Board of Review will see the case where a candidate turns 18 in three months and is rushing to execute a project.  Most Boards of Review will not take this circumstance as an extenuating circumstance, so make sure that you budget at least six months to execute a well-planned and well-thought project.  My recommendation is to give yourself at least six months to complete the project and prepare for the Board of Review.
*Before executing your project, make sure that a good majority of your merit badges are completed.  Environmental Science, Personal Management, Personal Fitness, and Family Life all have timeframes within their requirements.  It is far better to start them now while planning your project than wait until the last minute. Once again, leave yourself about six months of time between now and the Board of Review. 
*Discuss your plans with your Scoutmaster.  Keeping the Scoutmaster informed throughout the process to Eagle will make things a lot easier on you and your Scoutmaster when it comes time to submit the project to the District or Council Board of Review for preliminary approval, final submission, and the final Board of Review. 
*If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask your Scoutmaster, other Eagle Scouts in your Troop, or anyone you think might be able to help on your Trail to Eagle. 

===Expectations===
The requirement, in its most simple form, is to test your leadership skills. Nothing more, and nothing less.  So, the details of the project are completely up to you.  You will pick the project, approach the group that it will benefit, fund the project, do the work, and then prepare a written report on what you did.  So, the project is entirely up to you. Keep in mind, however, the following limits;
*You must lead the project entirely by yourself.  This is not your father's project, nor your mother's project, nor your Scoutmaster's project.  It is your project, and you are responsible for it. 
*The project CANNOT benefit the Boy Scouts of America.  It can, however, benefit your chartered partner (the church or school that your Troop meets at), a school, a church, or the community in general.  
*The project CANNOT be routine in nature.  You cannot cut the grass outside of the school and call it a service project.  You could, though, do some landscaping outside of the school. 
*The project CANNOT be a fundraiser in itself, however, you can raise funds for materials. 
*The project must be planned entirely by you. You cannot use an old Eagle Project plan verbatim, but you can use someone else's idea for it. 
*Anyone you choose may help you with your project.

The Internet is a wealth of knowledge on Eagle service projects.  I recommend running a basic Google search to find some examples of what some other Scouts have done in the past.  If you follow the guidelines above, plus one other major one I'll discuss in a moment, you shouldn't have a problem making yours work. 

But most of all, the project must fit you.  It must fit your age, your level of maturity, and your level of committment.  Most Boards of Review will expect the project to challenge the candidate's capabilities - if the project isn't challenging to you as an Eagle candidate, then you need to pick another project.

===Put it on Paper===
After you have identified a project idea, and you have discussed it with your Scoutmaster and the other adults at the Troop, it's time to start the paperwork so you can start your project.  Remember, you cannot execute your project until it has been approved by four distinct people:
*Your Scoutmaster.
*The head of the organization that your project will benefit.
*The Chairman of the District or Council Board of Review (or the person that generally approves Eagle service projects).
*Council or district advancement committee member.

Also remember, you must use the [http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/512-927_fillable.pdf Eagle Scout Service Project Workbook] when you are planning your project. There are electronic copies available at the link above, and I do recommend using an electronic copy to start off with.  If you do not have a computer, the old cut and paste method also works.  But, regardless, make sure whatever method you use is neat.  Use the best grammar possible.  

When writing your project up for inital approval, most Scouters recommend including every possible detail so that anyone else could lead your project for you.  The intent here is to give as much detail as you can so that the Board can see what it is that you're trying to do.  The more detail, the better - most projects are often sent back from the Board for lack of detail or the need to more clearly define a concept or action.  Plus, the more detail you provide here shows more effort on your part, which will go a long way with the Board.

*After a baby is born, the  [[w:en:lungs|lungs]] provide oxygen to the blood and remove carbon dioxide.
**The transition from using the placenta to using the lungs for gas exchange begins when the  [[w:en:umbilical cord|umbilical cord]] is clamped or tied off, and the baby has its first breath.

[[Category:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}|{{FULLCHAPTERNAME}}]]
The first few moments of a newborn's life can be the most critical. If needed, effective emergency care during this transition can prevent lifelong consequences. Proper resuscitation requires essential equipment and knowledge of necessary protocols before delivery. Prior knowledge of the gestational age of the newborn is helpful in anticipating the need for resuscitation. Low birth weight and premature delivery predispose infants to the need for resuscitative efforts.

Indications
Neonate with the following:
  	•   	Inadequate or ineffective respirations
  	•   	Inadequate heart rate
  	•   	Central cyanosis
  	•   	Other evidence of cardiorespiratory distress</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Warm Environment
**Babies who are kept warm (37°C) breathe better and have better circulation than babies who are cold.
**Heat can be lost in 3 different ways
***1. Radiant heat transfer: heat loss from the baby directly into the air if the air is colder than the baby
****A radiant heat warmer is needed to minimize radiant heat loss.
***2. Conduction: direct loss from contact between two solids
****Warm blankets are needed to minimize conductive loss. Placing the baby on the mother's warm skin will also minimize conductive heat loss.
***3. Convection: loss of heat as water evaporates from the baby's skin
****Newborns are wet and have a lot of surface area, making convective heat loss a significant risk.
****Drying the baby's head and putting a hat on minimizes convective heat loss from the head.
****Premature babies with immature skin can be gently wrapped in a watertight layer such as sterile plastic wrap from the neck to the feet to prevent damaging the skin and convective heat loss.

Discussion copied from [[en:Talk:Toll House cookie]]

It might be a good idea to remove the trademarks from this article.

:I didn't write the article, just added the first paragraph, but those are all quality ingredients for a more intense recipe and '''might''' be justified on that ground.   I don't think the person who wrote the recipe should sign it though. It certainly isn't original.    [[User:Ortolan88|Ortolan88]]

Well, the change to using a mixture of fats is not normal. Doubling the vanilla extract is mentioned in other recipes I've found. In any event, the changes are insignificant but are ''delicious''.  [[User:Bernfarr|BernFarr]]

Actually, didn't Nestle license the name Toll House cookies from the restaurant?  I know Nestle invented the chocolate chip just for the recipe.  That would justify keeping their name in there.  ~

The phrase 'Toll House Cookie' is trademarked to Nestle, I checked after someone pointed it out. [[User:Bernfarr|BernFarr]]

== Cooking Time ==

Hello, I just made a batch of cookies following this recipe, and they were far underdone. Did anyone else find that the suggested 10-12 minutes wasn't long enough? I might suggest 15-17 instead.

At 375 deg F, I find that my cookies bake in 8-11 minutes depending on altitude and the evenness of the oven. You might be using too much dough per cookie? Or your oven is underheated? Try getting an oven thermometer to see. [[User:Stevemidgley|Stevemidgley]] ([[User talk:Stevemidgley|talk]]) 19:03, 9 March 2008 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:E8009-Milyanfan-house-construction.jpg|500px|center|A house under construction in Milyanfan village, apparently with both adobe bricks and regular bricks being used.]]

The site you are building on should be flat, with no lumps or hillocks. to level, you could hire a bulldozer and go over the land with the blade close to the ground to remove all lumps or hillocks. If the plot is on a severe incline then lay stilts out so that you can lay out a floor level on top of them.

At times ground filling has to be done to raise ground to the required level.

== Foundation Construction ==

An integral part of home building as the structure will depend on it for load-bearing and to survive the environment. Considerations will not stop on immediate necessities like soil structure and characteristics but must be planed to deal with the probability of drastic environmental hazards, from floods, earthquakes even tornadoes.

In most construction, concrete is used as foundation. It is laid into a trench up to 3 or 4 feet deep, and provides a very solid foundation for whatever building material used. There are many different types of foundations.

The most typical foundation is made up of a footing which is the portion of the steel reinforced concrete that bears on the undisturbed soil. Footings are typically 12&quot; 16&quot; up to 36&quot; inches wide by 10&quot; to 12&quot; deep depending on the soil on which they are bearing. 
 
A foundation wall is general applied over the footing to above grade. Foundation walls are typically 8&quot; wide and terminate 8' above the finished grade.
like column footing , pile, raft etc. these are used as per condition of soil.
Waterproofing, dam-proofing and drainage are typically applied at the exterior of the foundation and footing. This is particularly important when building in wet soils.

The foundation is the most critical part of any structure. The structural failures due to faulty workmanship or to an insufficient thickness of the walls are rare in comparison with those due to defective foundations. When it is necessary, as so frequently it is at the present day, to erect gigantic edifices—as high buildings or long-span bridges—on weak and treacherous soils, the highest constructive skill is required to supplement the weakness of the natural foundation by such artificial preparations as will enable it to sustain the load with safety.

Natural Foundations. The soils comprised under this head may be divided into two classes. (1) Those whose stability is not affected by water, and which are firm enough to support the structure, such as rock, compact gravels, and hard clay, and (2) soils which are firm enough to support the weight of the structure, but whose stability is affected by water, such as loose gravels., sand, clay and loam.

Foundations on Rock. To prepare a rock foundation, all that is generally necessary is to cut away the loose and decayed portions and to dress the surface so exposed to a plane as nearly perpendicular to the direction of the pressure as practicable; or, if the rock forms an inclined plane, to cut a series of plane surfaces, like those of steps, for the walls to rest upon. If there are any fissures in the rock they should be filled with concrete.

Foundations on Gravel, Etc. In dealing with soils of this kind usually nothing more is required than to cover them with a layer of concrete of width and depth sufficient to distribute the weight properly.

Foundations on Sand. Sand is almost incompressible so long as it is not allowed to spread out laterally, but as it has no cohesion, and acts like a fluid when exposed to running water, it must be treated with great caution.

Foundations on Clay. Clay is much affected by the action of water, and hence the ground should be well drained before the work is begun, and the trenches so arranged that water does not remain in them. In general, the less a soil of this kind is exposed to the action of the air, and the sooner it is protected from exposure, the letter for the work. The top of the footings must be carried below the frost line to prevent heaving, and for the same reason the outside face of the wall should be built with a slight batter and perfectly smooth. The frost line attains a depth of six feet in some of the northern states.

The tearing power of clay and loamy soils may be greatly increased: (1) By increasing the depth. (2) By drainage. This may be accomplished by a covering of gravel or sand, the thickness depending upon the plasticity of the soil, and by surrounding the foundation walls with a tile drain. If springs are encountered the water may be excluded by sheet pilings, puddling or plugging the spring with concrete. (3) By consolidating the soil. This may te done by driving short piles Hose together, or by driving piles, then withdrawing them air filling the space immediately with damp sand well rammed. If the soil is very loose and wet, sand will not be effective, and concrete will be found more satisfactory.

Artificial Foundations. When the ground in its natural state is too soft to bear the weight of the proposed structure, recourse must be had to artificial means of support, and, in doing this, whatever mode of construction is adopted, the principle must always be that of extending the bearing surface as much as possible.

Foundations on Mud, silt, marshy or compressible soils are generally formed in one of three ways: (1) By driving piles in which the footings are supported. (2) By spreading the footings either by-layers of timber, steel beams, or concrete, or a combination of either. (3) By sinking caissons of iron or steel, excavating the soil from the interior, and filling with concrete.

= Structural building =
==Rough Framing==
The Framing begins with the anchoring of the studs to the concrete foundation. Walls are constructed of Wood Studs typical 16&quot; on center - framing studs come in 2 x 4, 2 x 6, 2 x 8, 2 x10 and lengths of 6,8,10,12 feet and longer. Floor/Ceiling joists are typically an engineered lumber product, as are the Roof Trusses, both ordered to size. Sheer Walls are constructed by sheathing the stud walls with plywood on one or both sides - used primarily in earthquake regions. Exterior walls are sheathed with plywood or [[w:Oriented_strand_board|oriented strand board]]  and usually a Owens Corning Rigid Insulation Product.

{{NOTE|There are no Federal Building Codes, each State and then County adopts its own building and safety codes. Typically a framing inspection, electrical inspection and plumbing inspection is required prior to walls being insulated and/or dry-walled.}}

==Masonry==
[[w:Stone Masonry|Masonry]] structures are those built of stone, or of stone-like (petrous) materials, leading to confusion since at times this activity is also referred to as Stone Masonry. The enduring character of masonry structures, the relative simplicity of the processes involved, the pleasing outlines usually obtained, together with the almost universal availability of the materials and the consequent moderate cost, render masonry construction one of the most important of the builder's activities. It is often used in creating the building foundations, walls, linings.

=== Footing courses ===
Footing courses are the bottom courses in masonry; they are generally built to extend beyond the face of the wall and to cover a greater area than the base of the regular wall. Footing courses distribute the weight of a structure over a great area, thus diminishing liability of settlement and increasing stability. Always use the largest stones in the footing courses; they should be laid upon their natural beds and well bonded into the wall so as to avoid the possibility of shearing off that portion of the footing course which projects beyond the face of the wall; also care should be observed, to keep all joints in this projecting portion of the footing courses, especially in brickwork, as far as possible back of face of wall. Stones used in footing courses should be at least eight inches thick and two or three feet on other dimensions. 
Footing courses should extend, at the bottom, at least twelve inches beyond the face of the wall.

=== Lime mortar ===
Usage: sticking stone and brick together

Fat limes (that is, limes which are pure, as opposed to hydraulic, water transferring limes which are burnt from [[w:limestone|limestone]] containing some clay) should not be used for mortar; they are slow-setting, and there is a liability for some of the mortar, where there is not a free access of air to assist the setting, remaining soft for some considerable period, often months, thus causing unequal settlement and possibly failure. Grey stone lime is feebly hydraulic, and makes a good mortar for ordinary work. It however, decays under the influence of the weather. It should never be used in foundation work, or where exposed to wet. Lias lime is hydraulic, that is, it will set firm under water. It should be used in all good class work. 

Ordinary lime mortar may have its strength considerably enhanced by the addition of a small proportion of Portland cement. 

[[w:Roman cement|Roman cement]] is rarely used for mortar, but is useful in some cases on account of the rapidity with which it sets, usually becoming hard about fifteen minutes after mixing. It is useful in tidal work and embankments, and constructions under water. It has about one-third of the strength of Portland cement, by which it is now almost entirely supplanted. 

Selenitic cement or lime, invented by Major-General H. V. D. Scott (1822-1883), is lias lime, to which a small proportion of plaster of Paris has been added with the object of suppressing the action of slaking and inducing quicker setting. If carefully mixed in accordance with the instructions issued by the manufacturers, it will take a much larger proportion of sand than ordinary lime.

Lime should be slaked before being made into mortar. The lime is measured out, deposited in a heap on a wooden &quot; bank &quot; or platform, and after being well watered is covered with the correct proportion of sand. This retains the heat and moisture necessary to thorough slaking; the time required for this operation depends on the variety of the lime, but usually it is from a few hours to one and a half days. If the mixing is to be done by hand the materials must be screened to remove any unslaked lumps of lime. The occurrence of these may be prevented by grinding the lime shortly before use. The mass should then be well &quot;larried&quot;, i.e. mixed together with the aid of a long-handled rake called the &quot;tarry.&quot; Lime mortar should be tempered for at least two days, roughly covered up with sacks or other material. Before being used it must be again turned over and well mixed together. 

Roman cement mortars must be mixed as required on account of its quick-setting properties. Fresh Roman cement mixtures must be made several times a day, as near as possible to the place of using. 

Cement mortars should never be worked up after setting has taken place. Care should be taken to obtain the proper consistency, which is a stiff paste. If the mortar be too thick, extra labor is involved in its use, and much time wasted. If it be so thin as to run easily from the trowel, a longer time is taken in setting, and the wall is liable to settle; also there is danger that the lime or cement will be killed by the excess of water, or at least have its binding power affected. 

It is not advisable to carry out work when the temperature is below freezing point, but in urgent cases bricklaying may be successfully done by using unslaked lime mortar. The mortar must be prepared in small quantities immediately before being used, so that binding action takes place before it cools. When the wall is left at night time the top course should be covered up to prevent the penetration of rain into the work, which would then be destroyed by the action of frost. Bricks used during frosty weather should be quite dry, and those that have been exposed to rain or frost should never be employed. It is generally agreed, that from a practical point of view, bricklaying should not be carried on at temperatures lower than 14° to 9° F, for as the thermometer falls the expense of building is greatly increased, owing to a larger proportion of lime being required.

For grey lime mortar the usual proportion is one part of lime to two or three parts of sand; lias lime mortar is mixed in similar proportions, except for work below ground, when equal quantities of lime and sand should be used. Portland cement mortar is usually in the proportions of one to three, or five, of sand ; good results arc obtained with lime mortar fortified with cement as follows:—one part slaked lime, one part Portland cement, and seven parts sand. Roman cement mortar should consist of one or one and a half parts of cement to one part of sand. Selenitic lime mortar is usually in the proportions of one to four or five, and must be mixed in a particular manner, the lime being first pround in water in the mortar-mill, and the sand gradually added. Blue or black mortar contains equal parts of foundry ashes and lime; but is improved by the addition of a proportion of cement. For setting fire-bricks fire-clay is always used. Pargetting for rendering inside chimney flues is made of one part of lime with three parts of cow dung free from straw or litter. No efficient substitute has been found for this mixture, which should be used fresh. A mortar that has found approval for tall chimney shafts is composed by grinding in a mortar-mill one part of blue lias lime with one part each of sand and foundry ashes. I n the external walls of the Albert Hall the mortar used was one part Portland cement, one part grey Burham lime and six parts pit sand. The lime was slaked twenty-four hours, and after being mixed with the sand for ten minutes the cement was added and the whole ground for one minute; the stuff was prepared in quantities only sufficient for immediate use. The by-laws dated 1891, made by the London County Council under section 16 of the Metropolis Management and Building Acts Amendment Act 18781 require the proportions of lime mortar to be one to three of sand or grit, and for cement mortar one to four. Clean soft water only should be used for the purpose of making mortar.

=== Bricks ===
==== Adobe, clay and straw bricks - hand-formed ====
Adobe, ado' bee, a word of Spanish origin, applies to unburnt, sun-dried bricks used in the arid regions of Mexico and the Southwest United States, and also to the peculiar clayey soil from which they are made. When moist, the soil is very plastic and can be molded into any shape, but when dry, adobe is almost unbreakable. This characteristic was recognized by the aborigines at an early date, and they not only made bowls, pitchers and other vessels from it, but shaped the muddy clay into bricks, which they laid out to dry in the sun. Adobe houses are common in Mexico and Arizona, even to-day. As they are cheap and easy to construct, they are used chiefly by the Mexicans and Indians, but many white people, who could afford other building material, prefer them because they are always cool, even in the hottest weather.

The process of making adobe bricks is simple. The wet adobe is shaped into bricks of various sizes, which are then baked by exposing them to the sun for ten days or two weeks. During this time they are turned every day. Bricks made in the same way were used by the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians, and were made by the children of Israel during their enslavement in Egypt. 

The art of making bricks dates from very early times, and was practiced by all the civilized nations of antiquity. Brick-making formed the chief occupation of the Israelites during their bondage in Egypt, but in this case the bricks were probably sun-dried only. These bricks were made of a mixture of clay and chopped straw or reeds, worked into a stiff paste with water. The clay was the river mud from the banks of the Nile, and as this had not sufficient cohesion in itself, the chopped straw (or reeds) was added as a binding material. The addition of such substances increases the plasticity of wet clay, especially if the mixture is allowed to stand for some days before use; so that the action of the chopped straw was twofold; a fact possibly known to the Egyptians. These sun-dried bricks, or &quot;adobes&quot;, are still made, as of old, on the banks of the Nile by the following method — a shallow pit or bed is prepared, into which are thrown the mud, chopped straw, and water in suitable proportions, and the whole mass is tramped on until it is thoroughly mixed and of the proper consistence. This mixture is removed in lumps and shaped into bricks, in molds or by hand, the bricks being simply sun-dried.

== Plumbing ==
Plumbing is a trade that supports a wide variety of services found in modern buildings and urban areas. At a basic level though, it is the craft that serves to provide clean, drinkable water to homes and businesses and conducts contaminated water away from them. To learn the theory and skill needed to construct and maintain the plumbing systems for large commercial buildings, install boilers, and other complex jobs, plumbers often receive years of training. However, the plumbing systems that bring hot and cold water to household fixtures (sinks, bathtubs, water closets, ...) and carry waste water away from them can be designed, built, and maintained by anyone who is willing to do careful research, invest in tools and practice, and proceed patiently and carefully with the work. It should be noted that as contracted labor only a certified professional should do plumbing in houses and commercial buildings due to the risk involved in maintaining water and sewer. The certification provides a level of guarantee about the capabilities of the professional and in some locations guarantees an insurance covering errors and damages.

=== Plumbing Codes ===
Many local, regional, and national governments enact regulations that apply to the way buildings are constructed. These regulations are put in place to protect citizens from dangerous conditions. The regulations that apply to a trade such as plumbing are called &quot;codes.&quot; Codes exist for general building, electrical work, plumbing, and other aspects of construction. Governments may write their own codes or use codes developed by outside authorities.

In many cases, the regulations are developed as a result of lessons learned through accidents and injuries. As trade experts analyze the flaws in a building that cause or contribute to fires, poisoning, falls, or other mishaps, they add rules to the relevant codes to reduce the chance of recurrence.

Plumbing codes are often associated with inspections. An inspection is done by a trade expert, designated by a government body, who checks work being done to a building to make sure that it is done according to the code. Some government bodies do not inspect work being done. There is a minimum standards code regulated by the U.S. government called the BOCA code. The only places that do not regulate and inspect plumbing are doing so illegally and should probably be avoided as the potential for drinking water contamination is extremely high. Many states have their own code but it can only be more stringent than the BOCA code, not less. One historical figure who gave momentum to the use of building codes in the United States was the early American Benjamin Franklin.

=== Water Supply ===

==== Pressure ====

=== Drainage and Venting ===   
The drain should be at least 1 1/2&quot; and should enter a pipe, sized by local plumbing codes, before exiting the structure to septic tank or sewer system. The ptrap of a lavatory or drinking fountain may be 1 1/4&quot;, no horizontal waste pipe under 1 1/2&quot; should ever be installed and should in no case carry a fixture load beyond the size of a double lavatory OR a bathtub, but not both. A 2&quot; pipe is needed for a kitchen sink or shower unit.

Most states require at least one 3&quot; vent through the roof, this is usually the vent serving the bathroom fixtures. Other vents may usually penetrate the roof at 2&quot;. Local codes influence the height of the pipe through the roof usually 12&quot; to 24&quot;, depending on how far north you are located.

=== Septic/Sewage Systems ===
How the septic tank system works - A typical septic system, consists of an underground tank, a distribution line and a soil absorption drainage field. Waste water leaves the home through an underground pipe connected to the septic tank. Baffles in the septic tank slow the flow of the incoming waste water and prevent sewage from flowing directly through the tank. Heavier solids settle to the bottom and accumulate as sludge.

The septic tank system is a natural sewage treatment and disposal system. By natural we mean that it relies on bacteria to digest and clean the waste water. Septic systems are biological systems and must have bacteria to work. The bacteria in the septic tank literally eat &amp; digest the solids in the tank turning them into liquids and gases.

Raw household waste water will quickly clog all but the most porous gravel formations. A septic tank is a watertight chamber, which conditions the waste water to reduce clogging so that it may be more readily absorbed into the soil. The septic tank separates the settable and floatable solids, promotes the growth of anaerobic bacteria necessary to decompose the solids, and provides storage for the resulting sludge and scum.

Constructing a septic tank system:
*Septic tanks should be located where they will not cause contamination of any well, spring or any other source of water supply.
*The septic tank should not be located closer than 10 feet from any building. The tank should not be located in swampy areas, or in areas subject to flooding.
*Slopes greater than 25 percent will cause considerable difficulty in construction, and may slide once they become saturated with effluent.
*There must be no permanent cover placed over the septic tank or lateral lines.

=== How to reduce HVAC energy cost ===

Most home owners already have a HVAC system on their house to help them control temperature on summer and winter season. Too much cold can bring you sickness that is why heater is very helpful. And in summer season, air conditioner is very useful on cooling down your house. 

Having a HVAC system installed in your house can definitely make your electricity bill high. Since it uses electricity, it will definitely increase your energy cost. 

Using HVAC system on winter and summer season is inevitable. You might want to know how to reduce your HVAC energy cost.

Here are some tips on how to reduce your HVAC energy cost:

'''Maintenance'''-
If you haven’t attended a maintenance program on your HAVC system, make sure you hire a HVAC service company to check your HVAC to see if it is working well. They will check if the parts are still in good condition and if your HVAC system heats and cools well. 
If you don’t maintain your HVAC system, it will soon get into worst condition. 

'''Stable temperature'''-
You also need to know the right temperature for you HVAC system. Most HVAC system have their temperature range to ensure its efficiency. You can check the HVAC system’s manual or consult a HVAC technician to know the most energy efficient temperature range. 
When using your HVAC system, don’t instantly put it on a higher temperature. For example, if it is a hot day, don’t put the thermostat on a higher level, you must first remove the heat using low temperature then make it high when the heat is gone.

'''Change Air filters'''-
You also need to change the air filters of your HVAC system for at least once a month. It is to make sure that your HVAC system has uninterrupted and smooth air flow. Don’t be so lazy on changing it, remember that it will cost you a lot if your HVAC system malfunctioned. 
Most people don’t change an air filter. That is why their energy cost is rising and the worst is, they pay for the service of the HVAC technician because their HVAC malfunctioned.

'''Help control the temperature'''-
When you are using your HVAC system, you can also help to control the temperature in your house. For example, it is very hot in your room. In order to make your room cool easily, you need to put curtains on your windows to block the heat rays from the sun. 

You also need to make sure that your windows and doors are closed. You can also use the fan to spread the cold air in your room. Air conditioner will take so long on making your room cools if heat rays are entering your room and the windows and doors are open.

You need to know proper way of using and some other things about HVAC system so that you can prevent it from malfunctioning, spending money on the HVAC service and electricity bill.

==Exterior Wall Surfaces==
Materials as Stucco, Brick, Stone, Wood Clapboard and Shingle are all cladding products. Modern wood frame construction requires the installation of a weather-resistive-barrier (WRB) under the cladding. The WRB provides the primary function of protecting the structure from water.

==Exterior Cast Stone==

=== Door &amp; Window Hardware === 
Installation of Door Hinges, Knobs/Lever, Cremone/Lock, Thresholds and Window Locks/Cranks &quot;Taqi&quot;. Although older houses may still contain single glazed wooden framed windows and doors; modern house usually have a steel or aluminum reinforced uPVC framed double glazed system. These window systems are fixed to the preformed concrete ope by use of usually a galvanized steel fixing bracket which clips to the frame of the window or door and is fix back to reveal.

The window will sit either on the upstand of a pre-cast concrete cill or onto a PVC of aluminum PPC cill. A silicone sealant or expandable foam can be used to weather the window or door once in place.

Doors may have to be sunk a few millimeters in order to achieve the correct height of threshold depending on building regulations governing the use of the door.

==Insulation==
A fundamental principle in building. It the means by which the interior environment can be made thermally comfortable. 
Insulation works by limiting the loss of  heat from a relatively warm environment to a relatively cold environment. This is achieved in a number of ways:

Limiting Convection (air) heat loss.
Most forms of insulation (such as polystyrene and fiberglass) contain cellular structures that trap air. This trapped air acts as a barrier to the passage of air through the insulating material.

Limiting Radiation heat loss
Insulating materials are generally good at limiting radiated heat by reflecting it in the same way that a mirror reflects light. Shiny metals such as aluminum are good at reflecting heat, and this material is often used as a backing for insulated panels.

One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Izehar. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Izehar~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

I'd like to see this book developed, just because I want to learn more about this!  Is anyone still working on this project?

I'd be glad to contribute what I can, since I know a bit about the subject. [[User:GutturalJeffo|GutturalJeffo]] ([[User talk:GutturalJeffo|talk]]) 08:59, 4 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Is this backwards ==

Copy img to floppy:

 dd bs=2x80x18b if=/dev/fd0 of=/tmp/floppy.img

The way I'm reading it is that its reading the floppy and creating an image of the floppy.
The description should read copying floppy to an img?

[[User:Randolph|Randolph]] ([[User talk:Randolph|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Randolph|contribs]]) 03:20, 8 January 2012 (UTC)

: Indeed it is. That command is copying the contents of the floppy drive to an .iso, where the description says the opposite. If people get the idea that this is how the command works, they will almost certainly end up inadvertently wiping their hard drive. &lt;tt&gt;dd&lt;/tt&gt; is a very dangerous command to get wrong. [[Special:Contributions/174.28.41.236|174.28.41.236]] ([[User talk:174.28.41.236|discuss]]) 20:54, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

I was looking at the vi commands. How much should really be put here and at what point of detail should we redirect the reader to 
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_vi:vi_Reference

Maybe we should include more detailed explanation to VI which should include. (This is not a exhaustive list but a pointer to what could be included.)
What is is VI?
Other editor avaible to edit a file in Linux.
Why use VI?
Navigating thru VI.
Most common file opeartion like cut, copy, paste, undo.
It's mode and commands; to save, quit without saving, quit..,
Commands to search, modify a file in VI.

The article; Linux Guide/Using the shell doesn't specify if it is a basic or a comprehensive guide to Linux shell, it worth adding a link to VI artice on that page.

== Job Control ==

I think job control is a very important part of the terminal. It comes in handy if you know how to use it. It's also a very fundamental part of the terminal. Therefore I think it should be included. I do not know how a procedure like this would go and if it is legitimate, but if it is agreed that job control should be included on this page, is it allowed to copy-paste bits of an already excellent article on [[A_Quick_Introduction_to_Unix/Job_Control | Job Control]]? --[[User:Evolutionist79|Evolutionist79]] ([[User talk:Evolutionist79|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Evolutionist79|contribs]]) 13:50, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

== Discuss Merging Linux Guide/Using the shell with Linux/Command Line Interface ==

It has been suggested that these two pages merge.  I support the suggestion.  Both pages go through a list of commands and discuss
command syntax.  

Using the Shell / Command Line Interface could become a truly HUGE discussion.  I suggest the effort be put into partitioning
it into linked but manageable chunks.  A short (few screens) section introducing command syntax and listing common commands
could be one section.

From there, one branches into

* Advantages of the command line
* Command line syntax
* Example command usage
* Command line tools: (vi is one, and somehow is already on this discussion page).
* Shell Scripting: (Itself a huge topic, related to the command line, but separate from it).
* Remote shells:
* Installation from the command line:

* ... This list goes on
pcardout 01:41, 22 May 2011 (UTC)

Yes, I agree. It is easier to keep one page updated than two; plus it is duplicated information

phillwuk 16th June 2012

This merge is warranted. I support it. [[Special:Contributions/174.28.41.236|174.28.41.236]] ([[User talk:174.28.41.236|discuss]]) 20:54, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

It's 13 months since the last discussion on this point and there seems to be unanimous consensus. Has any work on the merge been done? [[Special:Contributions/174.91.167.167|174.91.167.167]] ([[User talk:174.91.167.167|discuss]]) 21:02, 29 January 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following paragraph was on the Forward page:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''C# was originally designed to be the Microsoft's variant of [[w:en:Java_programming_language|Java]] and was originally named &quot;COOL&quot;, that however, was changed to C# later down the development process.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The original name of the language is definitely interesting. I hadn't heard that it was originally called &quot;COOL&quot;, so I thought it would be great to see a citing for that tidbit. &quot;Cool&quot; is such a common word in C# articles, though, that I couldn't locate a reference for that fact. I'm sure, too, that MS created C# to rival Java, but some people (MS marketing, for example), may disagree.

In any event, the [[w:en:C Sharp|Wikipedia C Sharp article]] seems the best place for that information, especially since it already has a [[w:en:C Sharp#language name|section on the language name]]. If somebody can confirm the accuracy of that language name evolution, it would be great if he or she could move that paragraph to the Wikipedia C Sharp article and cite a source. Until then, I think it's best to remove the unconfirmed paragraph from this article. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 20:32, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

I'm new here so I don't know the protocol regarding an &quot;Authors&quot; section. Is such a section appropriate for a WikiBook? [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 21:04, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

[http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,2180,1837433,00.asp|&quot;Cool&quot; Article] Here is mentioned that it was originally codenamed to be &quot;Cool&quot;, and sure we can cut out the &quot;rival Java part&quot;. --[[User:Eray|Eray]] 13:15, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

--Reply
I've removed the Authors part and added the History part containing links to references citing that the codename indeed was &quot;Cool&quot;, and the ECMA submission date.--[[User:Eray|Eray]] 13:27, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

:That &quot;Cool&quot; info in your ''History'' section is great, Eray. It would also be good copied into the [[w:C Sharp#Language name|&quot;Language name&quot; section of Wikipedia's C# article]]. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 22:09, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

==To do==

===[[C Sharp Programming]]===
* &lt;strike&gt;Complete moving pages from {{bad link|Programming:C sharp}} to [[C Sharp Programming]], per [[WB:NP]] and the [[Talk:C Sharp Programming/Archive 1#Navigation_template|C# book name discussion]]. ([[Template:C sharp/kw]] uses many pages under &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Programming:C sharp/Keywords/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.)&lt;/strike&gt;
* Organize sections to cover everything in the ECMA spec.
* Review for MS-centric vs. ECMA-centric terminology.
* Add at least one example for each keyword.
* Describe exception handling.
* Describe inheritance and partial types in [[C Sharp Programming/Classes]].
* Describe ''interfaces'' and ''delegates''.
* Describe versioning.
* Describe external aliases.
* Describe ''attributes''.
* Describe ''generics''.
* Describe ''anonymous methods''.
* Describe ''iterators''.
* Describe ''nullable types''.
* Describe ''lock''.
* Describe ''yield''.
* Describe ''qualified alias'', e.g. &lt;code&gt;global::SomeClass&lt;/code&gt;.
* Describe ''abstract'', ''sealed'', ''override'', ''virtual'', overloading.
* Describe ''readonly'', ''volatile''.
* Add [[C Sharp Programming]] links to table in [[Computer programming#Programming Concepts]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Remainder Theorem==
The remainder theorem states that: If you have a polynomial f(x) divided by x + c, the remainder is equal to f(-c). Here is an example.&lt;p&gt;
What will the remainder be if &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 8x^2 - 4x^2 + 17x - 40&lt;/math&gt; is divided by x - 3?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(3)= 3^3 + 8 \left ( 3 \right )^2 - 4\left ( 3 \right )^2 + 17\left ( 3 \right ) - 40 = 74&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The remainder is 74.

==Factorising==
When you factor an equation you try to &quot;unmultiply&quot; the equation. The N-Roots Theorem states that if f(x) is a polynomial of degree greater than or equal to 1, then f(x) has exactly n roots, providing that a root of multiplcity k is counted k times. The last part means that if an equation has 2 roots that are both 6, then we count 6 as 2 roots.

The factor theorem allows us to check whether a number is a factor. It states:

{{Remember|A polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a factor x - c if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(c) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.}}

For example:

Determine if x + 2 is a factor of &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 3x -2&lt;/math&gt;.

Since c is positive instead of negative we need to use this basic identity:

&lt;math&gt;x + 2 = x - \left ( - 2 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Now we can use the factor theorem.

&lt;math&gt;2 \left (-2 \right )^2 + 3 \left (-2 \right ) -2 = 8 - 6 - 2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the resultant is 0, (x+2) is a factor of &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 3x -2&lt;/math&gt;.

This means it is possible to re-state the polynomial in the form (x+2)( some linear expression of x).
 
So &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 3x -2&lt;/math&gt; = (x+2)(ax+b) 

Expanding the right hand side we get :

&lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 3x -2&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + x( 2a+b) +2b&lt;/math&gt;

Equating like terms we get :

2= a

2a+b = 3 and

2b = -2

Giving a= 2, b= -1 from the first and third equations and this works in the second, so 

&lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 3x -2&lt;/math&gt; = (x+2)(2x-1)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Structure ==

Esperanto words are formed by taking one or more ''roots'', modifiying them with one or more ''affixes'', then adding grammatical ''endings''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Description
!Word
!Meaning
|-
|Root meaning &quot;laugh&quot;
|{{lang eo|rid}}
|''No meaning''
|-
|Adding infinitive verb ending '''-i'''
|{{lang eo|ridi}}
|To laugh
|-
|Adding adjective ending '''-a'''
|{{lang eo|rida}}
|Laughing (for example, &quot;a laughing hyena&quot; is {{lang eo|rida hieno}})
|-
|Adding adjective ending '''-a''' and '''-ind''' affix meaning &quot;worthy of&quot;
|{{lang eo|ridinda}}
|Laughable (worthy of laughs)
|-
|Adding noun ending '''-o'''
|{{lang eo|rido}}
|(A) laugh
|-
|Adding noun ending '''-o''' and '''-ad''' affix meaning &quot;repeated action&quot;
|{{lang eo|ridado}}
|Laughter (repeated laughs)
|-
|Root meaning &quot;mock/tease&quot;
|{{lang eo|mok}}
|''No meaning''
|-
|Combining root for &quot;mock&quot; with root for &quot;laugh&quot;, then adding infinitive verb ending '''-i'''
|{{lang eo|mokridi (pri)}}
|To (mockingly) laugh (at)
|}

See the [[Esperanto/Appendix/Table of word endings|table of word endings]] and [[Esperanto/Appendix/Table of affixes|table of affixes]] for more [[Esperanto/Word synthesis|word synthesis]] options.

== Nouns ==

All words ending in '''-o''', '''-oj''', '''-on''' or '''-ojn''' are nouns.

By themselves, nouns are indefinite ({{lang eo|hundo}} means &quot;''a'' dog&quot;).
The definite particle is {{lang eo|la}} ({{lang eo|la hundo}} means &quot;''the'' dog&quot;).

=== Plural ===

Singular nouns end in '''-o''' (or '''-on''').
The plural is formed by adding '''-j''' (forming '''-oj''' or '''-ojn''').

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|hundo}}
|(a) dog
|-
|{{lang eo|hundoj}}
|(some) dogs
|-
|{{lang eo|la hundo}}
|the dog
|-
|{{lang eo|la hundoj}}
|the dogs
|}

=== Accusative case ===

When a noun is the object of a verb phrase, '''-n''' is added.
This allows variable word order.
In the following example, all of the Esperanto sentences mean the same thing.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Hundo pelas katon.}}
|rowspan=&quot;6&quot; |A dog is chasing a cat.
|-
|{{lang eo|Katon pelas hundo.}}
|-
|{{lang eo|Hundo katon pelas.}}
|-
|{{lang eo|Katon hundo pelas.}}
|-
|{{lang eo|Pelas hundo katon.}}
|-
|{{lang eo|Pelas katon hundo.}}
|}

With the plural, the same rules apply.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Hundoj pelas katojn.}}
|rowspan=&quot;6&quot; |Dogs chase cats.
|-
|{{lang eo|Katojn pelas hundoj.}}
|-
|{{lang eo|Hundoj katojn pelas.}}
|-
|{{lang eo|Katojn hundoj pelas.}}
|-
|{{lang eo|Pelas hundoj katojn.}}
|-
|{{lang eo|Pelas katojn hundoj.}}
|}

=== Verb nouns ===

Verb nouns do not exist in English, with the exception of the active present (usually by adding ''-er'': &quot;to view&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;the viewer&quot;), the passive present (usually by adding ''-ee'': &quot;to view&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;the viewee&quot;) and the passive past (usually by adding ''-ed'': &quot;to view&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;the viewed&quot;).
Esperanto has these forms and more.

However, Esperanto is much more specific than English.
{{lang eo|Skribanto}} means &quot;writer&quot;, but it specifically means &quot;person who is writing ''now''&quot;, not &quot;person who writes professionally&quot; (which would be {{lang eo|skribisto}}).

==== Active verb nouns ====

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
!Meaning
!Esperanto
!English
|-
!{{lang eo|-into}}
|One who was ...ing
|{{lang eo|Skribinto}}
|One who was writing
|-
!{{lang eo|-anto}}
|One who is ...ing
|{{lang eo|Skribanto}}
|One who is writing
|-
!{{lang eo|-onto}}
|One who will be ...ing
|{{lang eo|Skribonto}}
|One who will be writing
|}

==== Passive verb nouns ====

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
!Meaning
!Esperanto
!English
|-
!{{lang eo|-ito}}
|One who was ...ed
|{{lang eo|Amito}}
|One who was loved
|-
!{{lang eo|-ato}}
|One who is ...ed
|{{lang eo|Amato}}
|One who is loved
|-
!{{lang eo|-oto}}
|One who will be ...ed
|{{lang eo|Amoto}}
|One who will be loved
|}

== Adjectives ==

All words ending in '''-a''', '''-aj''', '''-an''' or '''-ajn''' are adjectives.

The ending modifiers are the same as for nouns.
The modifiers used are determined by the noun being modified.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
!Case
|-
|{{lang eo|granda hundo}}
|(a) big dog
|Subjective
|-
|{{lang eo|grandaj hundoj}}
|(some) big dogs
|Subjective
|-
|{{lang eo|grandan hundon}}
|(a) big dog
|Accusative
|-
|{{lang eo|grandajn hundojn}}
|(some) big dogs
|Accusative
|}

The adjective does not need to appear before, or even next to, the noun it is modifying.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|La hundo havas ruĝan pilkon.}}
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot; |The dog has a red ball.
|-
|{{lang eo|La hundo havas pilkon ruĝan.}}
|-
|{{lang eo|La hundo pilkon havas ruĝan.}}
|}

=== Verb adjectives ===

Verb adjectives are called participles.
English has two participle forms: present (usually by adding ''-ing'': &quot;to boil&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;boiling water&quot;); and past (usually by adding ''-ed'': &quot;to boil&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;boiled water&quot;).
Esperanto has these forms and more.

However, Esperanto is much more specific than English.
English does not encode whether the adjective is active or passive --- &quot;boiling water&quot; says that the water is being boiled (passive), but &quot;writing person&quot; says that the person is doing the writing (active).
If you wanted to express a passive form of writing, you would instead say the &quot;letter being written&quot;.
Attempting to express an active form of boiling would produce &quot;boiling person&quot;, which would most likely be understood as an idiom (such as &quot;extremely angry person&quot;) since it does not culturally make sense otherwise. 

=== Active verb adjectives ===

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
!Meaning
!Esperanto
!English
|-
!{{lang eo|-inta}}
|was ...ing
|{{lang eo|Paginta viro}}
|A man who was paying
|-
!{{lang eo|-anta}}
|...ing
|{{lang eo|Paganta viro}}
|Paying man
|-
!{{lang eo|-onta}}
|will be ...ing
|{{lang eo|Pagonta viro}}
|A man who will be paying
|}

==== Passive verb adjectives ====

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
!Meaning
!Esperanto
!English
|-
!{{lang eo|-ita}}
|...ed
|{{lang eo|Pagita viro}}
|Paid man
|-
!{{lang eo|-ata}}
|being ...ed
|{{lang eo|Pagata viro}}
|A man being paid
|-
!{{lang eo|-ota}}
|will be ...ed
|{{lang eo|Pagota viro}}
|A man who will be paid
|}

=== Agreement ===

As adjectives, they must match (or agree with) the noun they are modifying.

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|La libro estas skribata.}}
|The book is being written.
|-
|{{lang eo|La libroj estas skribataj.}}
|The books are being written.
|}

=== Dangling ===

In any English discussion of participles, the question of dangling participles may arise.

The first thing to realize is that English has a dangling modifier problem, participles just make it a little more obvious.
Esperanto does not have this problem usually because of the '''-n''' marker.

So in English we might say &quot;I saw a book looking through the window&quot;.
Grammatically, the book is looking so the participle is dangling (or attached to the wrong noun).

In Esperanto we would say &quot;Mi vidis libron vidanta tra la fenestro.&quot;
Without the '''-n''', &quot;mi&quot; is the noun that &quot;vidanta&quot; is modifying.
If we wanted to say that the book was looking we would say &quot;Mi vidis libro'''n''' vidanta'''n''' tra la fenestro.&quot;

====Why does this matter?====

&quot;Mi vidis hundon vidanta tra la fenestro.&quot;
I looked through the window and saw a dog.

&quot;Mi vidis hundon vidantan tra la fenestro.&quot;
I saw a dog, and that dog was looking through the window.

===Comparatives and Superlatives===
Comparatives are formed using {{lang eo|pli}} (more) or {{lang eo|malpli}} (less):
* {{lang eo|pli bela}} - more beautiful
* {{lang eo|malpli bela}} - less beautiful
* {{lang eo|pli bona}} - better
* {{lang eo|pli malbona}} - worse
* {{lang eo|pli saĝa}} - wiser

Superlatives are formed using {{lang eo|plej}} (most) or {{lang eo|malplej}} (least):
* {{lang eo|plej bela}} - most beautiful
* {{lang eo|malplej bela}} - least beautiful
* {{lang eo|plej bona}} - best
* {{lang eo|plej malbona}} - worst
* {{lang eo|plej saĝa}} - wisest

== Pronouns ==

Pronouns do not have a grammatical ending.
They all end in ''-i'', which is the infinitive verb ending.
However, this does not cause confusion, because there are only ten pronouns, so they are easy to identify.

As with nouns, pronouns have an accusative case formed by adding '''-n'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!colspan=&quot;2&quot; |Subjective
!colspan=&quot;2&quot; |Accusative
|-
!Esperanto
!English
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Mi}}
|I
|{{lang eo|Min}}
|Me
|-
|{{lang eo|Vi}}
|You (singular and plural)
|{{lang eo|Vin}}
|You (singular and plural)
|-
|{{lang eo|Li}}
|He
|{{lang eo|Lin}}
|Him
|-
|{{lang eo|Ŝi}}
|She
|{{lang eo|Ŝin}}
|Her
|-
|{{lang eo|Ĝi}}
|It
|{{lang eo|Ĝin}}
|It
|-
|{{lang eo|Ni}}
|We
|{{lang eo|Nin}}
|Us
|-
|{{lang eo|Ili}}
|They
|{{lang eo|Ilin}}
|Them
|-
|{{lang eo|Oni}}
|One
|{{lang eo|Onin}}
|One
|-
|{{lang eo|Ci}}
|Thou
|{{lang eo|Cin}}
|Thee
|}

{{lang eo|Oni}} means &quot;one&quot; in the sense of &quot;how does ''one'' do that?&quot; (&quot;{{lang eo|Kiel oni faras tion?}}&quot;).
It does not mean the number one (1).

=== Possessive ===

Possessive pronouns are simply adjectives formed from the pronouns by adding '''-a'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Mia}}
|My/mine
|-
|{{lang eo|Via}}
|Your/yours
|-
|{{lang eo|Lia}}
|His
|-
|{{lang eo|Ŝia}}
|Her/hers
|-
|{{lang eo|Ĝia}}
|Its
|-
|{{lang eo|Nia}}
|Our/ours
|-
|{{lang eo|Ilia}}
|Their/theirs
|-
|{{lang eo|Onia}}
|One's
|-
|{{lang eo|Cia}}
|Thy/thine
|}

They follow the same rules as other adjectives, and must agree with the plurality and subjective/accusative case of the noun they modify.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Mia hundo pelas vian katon.}}
|My dog is chasing your cat.
|-
|{{lang eo|La bluaj pilkoj estas liaj (pilkoj).}}
|The blue balls are his (balls).
|}

Note that certain copula verbs such as ''esti'' (to be) and ''ŝajni&quot; (to seem) do not take the accusative; the noun forms and modifying adjectives that follow such verbs are grammatically subjective-completion elements, not objects.

=== Reflexive ===

The reflexive pronoun is {{lang eo|si}} (with accusative case {{lang eo|sin}}).
It has a possessive form like any other pronoun (by adding '''-a''', which then has to agree in gender and case with the noun it is modifying).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
!Notes
|-
|{{lang eo|Li amas sin.}}
|He loves himself.
|If you said &quot;{{lang eo|Li amas lin.}}&quot;, you would be saying &quot;He loves him (some other guy)&quot;.
|-
|{{lang eo|Ŝi lavas siajn manojn.}}
|She washes her hands (her own hands).
|If you said &quot;{{lang eo|Ŝi lavas ŝiajn manojn.}}&quot;, you would be saying &quot;She washes her hands (some other woman's hands)&quot;.
|}

== Numbers ==

The cardinal numbers do not have a grammatical ending.
Other than {{lang eo|unu}}, {{lang eo|du}}, {{lang eo|tri}} and {{lang eo|naŭ}} (1, 2, 3 and 9), their endings cannot be confused with other grammatical endings.
For the four that do, this does not cause confusion, because there are only four of them, so they are easy to identify.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Nul}}
|Zero
|-
|{{lang eo|Unu}}
|One
|-
|{{lang eo|Du}}
|Two
|-
|{{lang eo|Tri}}
|Three
|-
|{{lang eo|Kvar}}
|Four
|-
|{{lang eo|Kvin}}
|Five
|-
|{{lang eo|Ses}}
|Six
|-
|{{lang eo|Sep}}
|Seven
|-
|{{lang eo|Ok}}
|Eight
|-
|{{lang eo|Naŭ}}
|Nine
|-
|{{lang eo|Dek}}
|Ten
|-
|{{lang eo|Cent}}
|(One) hundred
|-
|{{lang eo|Mil}}
|(One) thousand
|}

The remaining numbers are formed by combination of these bases.
Concatenating numbers together, as in {{lang eo|naǔcent}} (&quot;nine hundred&quot;), implies multiplication, otherwise addition is implied.
For example 1984 is {{lang eo|mil naŭcent okdek kvar}}.

Note that the cardinal numbers only refer to the ''idea'' of the numbers, not specific instances; for that you use the noun form (with '''-o''', and normal noun rules).
If you wanted to say someone wrote one instance of ''the number one'', and two instances of ''the number five'', you would say: {{lang eo|Iu skribis '''unu unuon''', kaj '''du kvinojn'''.}}

=== Ordinals ===

Ordinal numbers are adjectives, formed with '''-a'''.
They follow the same rules as other adjectives, and must agree with the plurality and subjective/accusative case of the noun they modify.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
!Notes
|-
|{{lang eo|Unua}}
|First
|
|-
|{{lang eo|Dua}}
|Second
|
|-
|{{lang eo|Dudek-unua}}
|Twenty-first
|With compound numbers, a hyphen must be used.
|}

As in English, they can be abbreviated.
This is done by replacing the word for the cardinal number with the number: {{lang eo|unua}} &amp;rarr; {{lang eo|1a}}.
Because they are still adjectives, agreement is necessary: {{lang eo|unuan}} &amp;rarr; {{lang eo|1an}}, {{lang eo|unuaj}} &amp;rarr; {{lang eo|1aj}}.

== Adverbs ==

Adverbs are formed from roots with the ending '''-e'''.

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Bone}}
|Well
|-
|{{lang eo|Rapide}}
|Quickly
|}

Not all adverbs end with '''-e''' because not all adverbs are formed from root words.
There is a small subset of words that can function as adverbs, but are not &quot;pure&quot; adverbs, and often can function as other parts of speech.
Some can function as both adverbs and nouns ({{lang eo|hodiaŭ}} &amp;rarr; &quot;today&quot;), others as adverbs and conjunctions ({{lang eo|kvazaŭ}} &amp;rarr; &quot;as if, as though&quot;), others as adverbs and adjectives ({{lang eo|ambaŭ}} &amp;rarr; &quot;both&quot;), others as adverbs and prepositions ({{lang eo|ĉirkaŭ}} &amp;rarr; &quot;around&quot;), others as adverbs and pronouns ({{lang eo|pli}} &amp;rarr; &quot;more&quot;).
They generally have the ending ''-aŭ'' (the &quot;indeterminate part-of-speech&quot; grammatical ending), but not always.

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|eĉ}}
|even
|-
|{{lang eo|hodiaŭ}}
|today
|-
|{{lang eo|iom}}
|a little, rather, some, somewhat, to some extent
|-
|{{lang eo|ĵus}}
|just, just now
|-
|{{lang eo|nun}}
|now
|-
|{{lang eo|nur}}
|only
|-
|{{lang eo|pli}}
|more
|-
|{{lang eo|plu}}
|further, more
|-
|{{lang eo|tro}}
|overly, too much
|-
|{{lang eo|tuj}}
|immediately
|}

It is always legal to add '''-e''' to the end of these pseudo-adverbs to make them true adverbs ({{lang eo|pli}} &amp;rarr; {{lang eo|plie}}), but this is rarely done for most of them.
{{body note|It is also legal to add other grammatical endings ({{lang eo|nun}} &amp;rarr; {{lang eo|nuno}}, {{lang eo|nuna}}).}}

== Verbs ==

There are no irregular verbs.
All conjugations are formed by adding the right ending to the root.

=== Infinitive ===

The infinitive ending is '''-i'''.

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Esti aŭ ne esti.}}
|To be or not to be.
|-
|{{lang eo|Mi volas skribi librojn.}}
|I want to write books.
|}

=== Imperative ===

The imperative ending is '''-u'''. It is used for giving direct commands (''Go!'') or for expressing our will (''Let's...'').

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Estu!}}
|Do it!
|-
|{{lang eo|Ne skribu librojn.}}
|Don't write books.
|-
|{{lang eo|Li skribu multajn librojn!}}
|Let him write many books/May he write many books!
|-
|{{lang eo|Ni iru al la kinejo.}} 
|Let's go to the cinema.
|-
|{{lang eo|Mi iru tiam ĉi.}}
|I should go now.
|}

=== Tenses ===

The present tense ending is '''-as'''.
The past tense ending is '''-is'''.
The future tense ending is '''-os'''.
There is no agreement with number or gender of either subject or object.

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Mi skribas librojn.}}
|I write books.
|-
|{{lang eo|Mi skribis librojn.}}
|I wrote books.
|-
|{{lang eo|Mi skribos librojn.}}
|I will write books.
|}

=== Conditional ===

The conditional ending is '''-us'''; as in English it is also used as a polite way to express a wish or request.

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|Se mi povus, mi skribus librojn.}}
|If I could, I would write books.
|-
|{{lang eo|Se mi estus vi, mi skribus librojn.}}
|If I were you, I would write books.
|-
|{{lang eo|Ĉu mi povus havi tason da teo?}}
|Could I have a cup of tea?
|}

=== Participles ===

Participles are adjectives formed from verbs.
There are two types: the active and the passive.

==== Active participles ====

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
!{{lang eo|estas}}
!{{lang eo|estis}}
!{{lang eo|estos}}
|-
!{{lang eo|-inta}}&lt;br/&gt;(action recently completed)
|{{lang eo|estas skribinta}}&lt;br/&gt;(has written)
|{{lang eo|estis skribinta}}&lt;br/&gt;(had written)
|{{lang eo|estos skribinta}}&lt;br/&gt;(will have written)
|-
!{{lang eo|-anta}}&lt;br/&gt;(action still ongoing)
|{{lang eo|estas skribanta}}&lt;br/&gt;(is writing)
|{{lang eo|estis skribanta}}&lt;br/&gt;(was writing)
|{{lang eo|estos skribanta}}&lt;br/&gt;(will be writing)
|-
!{{lang eo|-onta}}&lt;br/&gt;(action soon to begin)
|{{lang eo|estas skribonta}}&lt;br/&gt;(is going to write)
|{{lang eo|estis skribonta}}&lt;br/&gt;(about to write)
|{{lang eo|estos skribonta}}&lt;br/&gt;(will be about to write)
|}

As adjectives, they must agree in case and number with the noun they are modifying, which is the subject of the active participle phrase.

As adjectives, they must agree in case and number with the noun they are modifying, which is the subject of the passive participle phrase.

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|La libro estas skribata.}}
|The book is being written.
|-
|{{lang eo|La libroj estas skribataj.}}
|The books are being written.
|}

The direct object of sentences in passive voice is denoted by '''{{lang eo|de}}''' after the participle:

{|  class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
|{{lang eo|La libro estas skribata de mi.}}
|The book is being written by me.
|}

== Conjunctions ==

Conjunctions do not have a grammatical ending.
Other than {{lang eo|ĉu}} (&quot;whether/or&quot;), {{lang eo|se}} (&quot;if&quot;) and {{lang eo|ke}} (&quot;that&quot;), their endings cannot be confused with other grammatical endings.
For those that can, this does not cause confusion, because there are only a small number of them, so they are easy to identify.

== The Time of Day ==
Ordinal numbers ({{lang eo|unua, dua}}) are used for the hour of the day, with ''horo'' expressed or understood. The minutes are expressed by cardinal numbers ({{lang eo|unu, du}}). In questions, as well as using ''kiam'', the adjective ''kioma'' (from ''kiom'', how much) can be used:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Esperanto
!English
|-
| {{lang eo|Kiam vi alvenos?}}
| When will you arrive?
|-
| {{lang eo|Kioma horo estas?}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">The intake system is responsible for delivering oxygen, which is necessary for combustion.  An intake system generally comprises an air filter, a throttle, and passageways for air to reach the cylinders themselves.

There are several main types of intake systems.  Carbureted, Fuel Injected, Naturally Aspirated, and Forced Induction.

== Carburetor ==
The Carburetor is a device that mixes fuel(Gasoline especially petrol) into the incoming air for better combustion of it.  The airflow into the carburetor is controlled by a butterfly valve &amp; throttle valve, and the fuel is added to the mixture through venturis
types of carburetor 
1.single venturie 
2.multi venturie 
a.up draught
b.down draught
c.side draught
== Naturally Aspirated ==
An engine that is naturally aspirated uses the dynamic forces involved its in own operation to move air into its cylinders.

Simply put, if an engine is not turbocharged or supercharged, and if it does not use NOS, it is naturally aspirated. There are a few exceptions, but they are so rare that it's not even worth going into them.

== Forced Induction ==
Forced induction involves mechanical devices which force air into the cylinders.  This greater density of oxygen allows for greater expansion, but as the engine block is mostly static, the greater expansion translates into greater force and thus more torque. Both methods of forced induction increase fuel consumption because as more air is forced into the engine, more fuel must be added as well to maintain a safe air/fuel ratio.

===Turbocharging===
A turbocharger is a device which reuses the engine's exhaust gases to cram more air into the engine, resulting in more power.

A disadvantage of turbocharging is that they have lag, which is a noticeable delay in the time between when the accelerator is fully applied and the time when the turbo kicks in. Turbo lag is not noticeable on high quality cars, such as Porsches.

===Supercharging===
A supercharger also forces more air into the engine just like a turbo, except that a supercharger is driven by the engine's crankshaft rather than by the exhaust gases.

A supercharger has an advantage over a turbocharger in that there is no lag. Another advantage is that the supercharger works even at low RPM, while turbos only work at higher RPM.

'''''Start Working NOW!'''''

The Extended Essay (EE) is one of the requirements of the IB Diploma Programme. It provides students with an opportunity to conduct independent research on a topic of interest to them. It is written on a freely-chosen topic as long as there is a subject teacher in school, as the candidate must have a subject supervisor.

===Recommendations=== 

The IBO recommends that candidates spend approximately 40 hours in total on their extended essays, and if you put it off until that last weekend, your work won't be nearly as good as it can be. Talk to your IB school supervisor, as it is his or her job to set internal school deadlines (i.e. choosing a topic, formulating an outline, rough draft, final draft, etc).

==Getting Started==

:*Firstly, find a topic you're actually interested in, or you'll never work on it. 
:*Don't stress. After doing all your research 4,000 words is nothing (your first draft could be 6,000-8,000 words). While the Extended Essay has the potential to make you hate your own topic (as many academic assignments do), an interest in the topic can motivate you to pull through in the end.
:*Many students are appalled at the sheer number of words that this task requires. But by following the guidelines set out for you, you'll quickly realize how hard pressed you will be to contain your work to the limit.
:*Make sure that your focus is somewhat specific, or that you have a specific topic in mind (instead of just a general subject area). 
::*'''Example''': Your final essay title should be somewhat similar to the style used in the Internal Assessments for the 20th Century World Issues course - specific and focused with some form of cause and effect. Check the official Extended Essay guidelines for more on this - it offers sample essay titles (along with title choosing advice and essay titles to avoid) for each subject area.
::*If the above example does not apply to you, perhaps ask your IB Coordinator for examples from students past. Many of them keep a record of every essay, mainly to ensure there is no plagiarism.
:*Make sure you stay on top of the work.  
:*Look over the guidelines and the explanations. 

To get a diploma, you need to complete the TOK Essay and the Extended Essay. At best, you can achieve 3 bonus points towards your IB diploma, so don't ignore your schoolwork, as your courses are worth much more. The point matrix is outlined in the &quot;Diploma Points Matrix for the Extended Essay and TOK&quot; grid in the IBO form. You can still get your diploma if you get a &quot;Mediocre&quot; on one and an &quot;Elementary&quot; on another.
NOTE: As of May 2010, an 'Elementary' on both TOK and Extended essay is an automatic fail, but you may still pass with an 'Elementary' on either one, just not both. An 'Elementary' on either is a so called 'failing condition' which requires a minimum 28 points rather than the usual 24 to obtain your diploma.

However, you can make a very good essay, provided you allot yourself enough time to write about something you are interested in. The IBO knows that you are between 16 and 18 years old and thus does not require a perfect essay or a groundbreaking new discovery. They just want to see that you can work on and complete a big project. 

====Picking a Topic====
You'll want to write about a topic or subject you're fairly familiar with.  For instance, if you've nailed the process of writing labs, do a science investigation. It'll be just like a big lab write-up, and writing the method, materials, qualitative/quantitative observations are all part of the word count, and take up a significant amount of words.

=====Essay Competitions=====
Find out if there are competitions or scholarship opportunities in which you can enter your essay. Why not kill two birds with one stone and head off to university with a scholarship? If you don't win, at least you'll get feedback, something the IBO neglects to give.

==Writing a Good Extended Essay''==
Everyone wants to write a good Extended Essay, but just remember that it's really not as overwhelming as it sounds. Some candidates will find their first drafts are in the 6,000 to 8,000 range, while others will reach about 2800-3500.  In fact, keep in mind that 4,000 words is the ''maximum'' word count and not where you must get to. While most essays have a word count in the 3,900 range, it is perfectly acceptable to submit an essay that is 3,500 words. While there is no actual minimum word count, you would probably want to write over 3,000 words, since a short essay might imply that the topic was not investigated thoroughly enough. However, some topics - mathematics among them - may require only 2,000 words to fully investigate them.

===Citing Sources===
Keep legible, consistent and accurate notes that include bibliographic information. There's nothing more annoying than browsing through a 1200 page book looking for where that key quotation came from. Cite your sources in a consistent manner (either in MLA or APA format, or some other recognized format). IBO is very strict with plagiarism, so remember that the text has to be your own and do not forget to make references. You will have to sign an IBO form certifying that your EE is your own, and has no unsourced material in it, before they will even read your essay. Failure to submit an Extended Essay will result in no diploma being awarded.

Use the internet to find information but do include books in your research especially if your essay is not on the Sciences. Be skeptical in your use of the internet. Anyone can post anything, so read with a critical eye. Generally, university and academic websites are good sources to refer to. News sources are generally reliable, but be sure to stay away from &quot;gossip&quot; media which often contorts the truth.

Keep in mind that a general guide line used in many schools is 5 sources minimum for the IA in History, so if you are doing a History paper aim to have as close to ten sources as possible if not more for the EE.

===Organization===
Once you have researched your topic, you should spend a lot of time structuring and organizing your essay. Make sure your essay has a clear introduction, research question/focus (i.e. what you will be investigating), body, and conclusion. A poorly organized or unclear essay will hurt the assessment of your essay. You should also spend some time making sure that your 300-word abstract is clear and succinct in summarizing your essay. An unclear abstract will make your essay difficult to understand and will also hurt the assessment of your essay.

Although this is stated in the &quot;General Requirements&quot; for the Extended Essay, I feel it is necessary to repeat: if you are doing a paper in a subject not offered at your school, '''be very careful''', ''especially'' if doing your paper in World Religions. You might want to either reconsider your choice of topic, or make sure you have several people with good credibility in that topic reading your paper. If you don't, especially in World Religions, you could end up offending your reader, and I promise you, you do '''not''' want to do that.

You can do your extended essay on any topic for which an IB class exists - i.e. something like Islamic History, which only about 100 candidates a year write about. However, you cannot do your extended essay in Theory of Knowledge, most pilot subjects and school-based syllabus subjects (check with your IB coordinator). Bear in mind that getting a good score in your extended essay, combined with your score for your Theory of Knowledge essay, may reward you with up to 3 bonus points. So aim high!

===IBO Official Guide===

The IBO's official guide to writing the Extended Essay can be found here: http://xmltwo.ibo.org/publications/DP/Group0/d_0_eeyyy_gui_1012_1/html/production-app3.ibo.org/publication/258/part/1/chapter/1.html

The above site is quite useful in perusing tips and hints for writing the essay, in addition to viewing the IBO standards for the essay. Note that the above link is for consideration purposes only.

'''Semi-protection''' of a page prevents '''unregistered users''' and '''users with very new accounts''' from editing that page.

Semi-protection:
*Is '''''not''''' intended to prohibit anonymous editing in general.
*Is '''''not''''' intended for pre-emptive protection of articles that ''might'' get vandalized.
*Is '''''not''''' to be used for edit warring or revert wars. 

Semi-protection is only applied if the page in question is facing a serious vandalism problem. It is not an appropriate solution to editorial disputes of any kind since it may restrict some editors and not others. Administrators apply semi-protection in the same manner as current full protection against vandalism is applied &amp;mdash; either on their own initiative or following an alert on an article's talk page, [[Wikibooks:Protected page|requests for page protection]], [[WB:SL|the staff lounge]], or some other relevant page.

Semi-protection is only to be applied as a ''response'' to serious vandalism and not as a ''pre-emptive'' measure against the threat or probability of vandalism, such as when certain pages suddenly become high profile due to current events or being linked from a high-traffic website.  Only when there is evidence of a serious problem of vandalism should semi-protection be applied. ''Do not semi-protect the Featured Article, unless the page is currently experiencing significant vandalism.''

'''Administrators: note''' that semi-protection should only be considered if it is the only option left available to solve the problem of vandalism of the page. In other words, just like full protection, it is a last resort, not a pre-emptive measure.

To request that semi-protection of an article be lifted, a simple note on the article's talk page or the [[WB:SL|staff lounge]] should be sufficient, but the [[Wikibooks:Protected page|requests for protection page]] can be used if necessary. Requests to lift semi-protection should generally be unnecessary in the same way that unprotection after simple vandalism at present is generally swiftly seen to by either the protecting admin or another. When semi-protecting a page, add it to [[Wikibooks:Protected page]] just as you would for a fully protected page.
{{Meta|Semi-protection}}
Articles that are semi-protected are indicated with {{tl|sprotected}} and listed at [[Wikibooks:Protected page]] in the same way as protections are at present.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Yorktown1776. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Yorktown1776~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Make as a part of the [[Wikibooks:Protected page|general protection policy]] ==

This is an interesting idea.  There are a number of pages that are currently &quot;protected&quot; that I would like to see moved to semi-protection status.  I've gone and &quot;protected&quot; a couple of pages that seem to have been a target of recent vandalism that in particular would be useful to move under this general umbrella.

BTW, what is the specific technical requirement in order to accomplish this task?  Do we need to ask the developers to &quot;upgrade&quot; MediaWiki for Wikibooks to get this feature?  I don't see any ability to semi-protect any pages currently on Wikibooks.

This policy proposal also needs to be modified slightly to fit the terminology for Wikibooks (modules, not articles, and Books of the Month instead of featured articles) and there are a few unique aspects for Wikibooks that may need to review the policies to fit this project as opposed to how things are done on Wikipedia.  Not a bad idea though. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:21, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

:I agree. We don't need to have this as a separate policy, only as an addition to the current protection policy. Maybe somebody should try merging this in to a proposal, and we can vote on it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:47, 12 July 2006 (UTC)


== Move to Reject, merge to [[Wikibooks:Protected page]] ==

I am moving to '''reject''' this proposal, and merge anything that is salvagable (if anything is) to [[Wikibooks:Protected page]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:35, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Agree''' --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:54, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

:I don't really have an opinion either ways, but you might want to look at the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=protect&amp;user=&amp;page= protection log]... a lot of pages have been protected over the past several days. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:42, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

::Protecting a page, or unprotecting a page are subject to [[Wikibooks:Protected page]]. This policy is essentially a fork of that policy, and therefore can be rejected. The pages that have been protected in the last couple days don't really have anything to do with this, that I can see. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:52, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

==Semi-protection==

How do I enable Semi-protection for all pages with MediaWiki?

:I'd have thought it would be easier to simply not allow IPs to edit rather than trying to protect the pages. In other words, set group &quot;all&quot; to NOT have the rights createtalk, createpage and edit. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:10, 9 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Imaginary numbers==

Before understanding complex numbers, we need to know about the imaginary unit, i. i arises from the need to be able to calculate the square root of negative numbers.

Think of the equation &lt;math&gt; x^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;. From this, we can see that 

:&lt;math&gt; x = \sqrt{-1} &lt;/math&gt;. 

All logic tells you that you cannot multiply anything by itself and achieve a negative number, and this is true. So we give it a value of i. 

:&lt;math&gt; i = \sqrt{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

From this, we can see that:

:&lt;math&gt; i^2 = -1 &lt;/math&gt;

From here we can derive that:

:&lt;math&gt; i^3 = -i &lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt; i^3 = i^2 * i^1&lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; i^1 = i. &lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; i^2 = -1. &lt;/math&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; Thus, -1 * i = -i &lt;/math&gt;

Finally: {{Helpful hint|hint=When dealing with powers of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, some find it useful to deal with &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in pairs. For example, thinking of &lt;math&gt; i^4 &lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; i^2 * i^2 &lt;/math&gt;.}}

:&lt;math&gt; i^4 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

As -1 squared is equal to 1.

With this we have a very valuable tool and are now able to do square roots of negative numbers.

==Simple Operations With Complex Numbers==

Complex numbers are numbers that consist of a real number and an imaginary number. They come in the form of x + y i. (With x and y being real numbers and i being the imaginary unit).

They add up very much like you would imagine. Take the two complex numbers (2+3i) and (3+4i). Adding the two together is as simple as adding the real parts (in this case: 2 + 3 = 5) and adding the imaginary parts (3i + 4i = 7i) to give us the final complex number of (5 + 7i).

The same applies for subtraction. Taking our example complex numbers of (2+3i) and (3+4i). We just subtract the real part (2 - 3 = -1) and subtract the imaginary part (3i - 4i = -i) to give us our new complex number (-1 -i).

Multiplication is much like expanding quadratic and cubic equations. Simply, you just take the two complex numbers, sit them side by side and multiply out. Taking our example complex numbers we would do the following:

&lt;math&gt; (2+3i)(3+4i) = (2*3) + (2*4i) + (3i*3) + (3i*4i) = 6 + 8i + 9i + 12i^2 = 12i^2 + 17i + 6 &lt;/math&gt;

It really is as simple as thinking of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; like &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in our quadratics and treating it in exactly the same way, then replacing &lt;math&gt;i^2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i^3&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i^4&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Argand diagrams==

{{Remember|The '''modulus''' of a complex number is the length of the line that joins the origin of an Argand diagram to the point that represents the complex number, and it is given by:

&lt;math&gt;|z|=\sqrt{zz*}=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z=x+iy&lt;/math&gt;.}}


{{Remember|The '''argument''' of a complex number is the angle in radians of the complex number point from the real axis (the x-axis), measured counterclockwise. The argument for a complex number z, denoted arg(z), is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\theta = tan^{-1}\Bigg({\frac{y}{x}}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

if it is in the first quadrant.
}}

When representing a complex number on an Argand diagram, we can see that

:&lt;math&gt;sin\theta = \frac{y}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y=rsin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise:

:&lt;math&gt;x=rcos\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

Since a complex number z can be represented by x+iy,

:&lt;math&gt;z=rcos\theta+irsin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z=r(cos\theta+isin\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;

{{Remember|A complex number can be represented in either Cartesian or polar form. The polar form is:

&lt;math&gt;z=r(cos\theta+isin\theta)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where r is &lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;/math&gt; and &amp;theta; is the argument of z.}}

The polar form of a complex number is very similar to how we represent vectors. Accordingly, the modulus of a complex number is analogous to the resultant of the x and y components, and the argument is the direction of the resultant vector.

{{Remember|Euler's relationship is:

&lt;math&gt;e^{i\theta}=cos\theta + isin\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

By substituting this into the polar form for a complex number, we can see that another way of writing the complex number z is:

&lt;math&gt;|z|e^{iarg(z)}\,&lt;/math&gt;
}}

==Complex conjugates and equations==
&lt;!-- Argand diagram to go here --&gt;

Conjugates are just reflections of co-ordinates on an Argand diagram. They are reflected across the real axis and thus only the imaginary co-ordinate is changed (from, say, 2 + 2i to 2 - 2i).
In other words, the sign of the imaginary part is changed (from negative to positive or vice versa).

Complex conjugates are useful when dividing complex numbers as the denominator can be made real by multiplying the top and bottom of the fraction by the complex conjugate of the denominator, for example: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2+4i}{1+i}= \frac{(2+4i)(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)}= \frac{2+2i+4}{1+1}= \frac{6+2i}{2}= 3+i&lt;/math&gt;

This is called realising (the complex number version of rationalising) the denominator.

Conjugates are also useful when solving equations with real coefficients. If such an equation has an complex root, then the conjugate of the complex number will also be a root of the equation, allowing you to factorise the equation fully in most cases in exams.

{{Remember|If a polynomial has real coefficients and if any of its roots are complex, then these roots will occur in conjugate pairs.}}

'''Example:'''
Given that &lt;math&gt;-1+2i&lt;/math&gt; is a solution, find the other roots of the equation &lt;math&gt;x^3+4x^2+9x+10=0&lt;/math&gt;.

We automatically know one of the other roots is -1-2i (since the coefficients of the polynomial above are all real) so we can start to form a factorization of the equation:

&lt;math&gt;x^3+4x^2+9x+10 = (x-b)(x-(-1+2i))(x-(-1-2i))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;=(x-b)(x^2 + x + 2xi + x + 1 + 2i -2xi -2i -4i^2)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=(x-b)(x^2 +2x + 5)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x - bx^2 - 2bx - 5b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=x^3 + (2-b)x^2 + (5-2b)x - 5b\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow\begin{cases}
(2-b) = 4\\
(5-2b) = 9\\
-5b = 10
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow b = -2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- More info requested please!

Help, with equations appreciated.

Thanks. --&gt;

Now that we know about complex numbers, we can start to solve quadratic equations whose determinant is negative (i.e. quadratics that do not cross or touch the x-axis on a Cartesian graph).

'''Example:'''
Solve the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2-2x+5 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;b^2-4ac=-16&lt;/math&gt; we know that the equation does not have any real roots. Using the quadratic formula:

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{2\pm\sqrt{-16}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow x=\frac{2\pm4i}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow x=1\pm2i&lt;/math&gt;

==Square rooting complex numbers==

Every complex number has two complex square roots. To find them for the general complex number x+iy, we denote the answer by p+iq and equate:

:&lt;math&gt;(p+iq)^2 = x+iy&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p^2+2ipq-q^2 = x+iy&lt;/math&gt;

Since x is the only real term on the right-hand side, it must be equal to &lt;math&gt;p^2-q^2&lt;/math&gt;, which are the real terms of the left-hand side. Likewise, y must be equal to 2pq. This is a general rule:

{{Remember|Two complex numbers, p+qi and r+si, are identical if and only if &lt;math&gt;p=r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q=s&lt;/math&gt;.}}

If we were trying to find the square roots of, say, 2+4i, we would have:

:&lt;math&gt;p^2-q^2 = 2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2pq = 4&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow p = \frac{4}{2q}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting:

:&lt;math&gt;\Bigg(\frac{4}{2q}\Bigg)^2 - q^2 = 2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \frac{16}{4q^2} - q^2 = 2&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;4q^2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;16 - 4q^4 = 8q^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow 4q^4 +8q^2 -16 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow q^4 +2q^2 -4 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for u:

:&lt;math&gt;u^2+2u-4=0&lt;/math&gt;

Using the quadratic formula:

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4-4 \cdot 1 \cdot -4}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow u = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{20}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Since q is real, it must be equal to the square root of the positive value of u:

:&lt;math&gt;q = \sqrt {\frac{-2 + \sqrt{20}}{2}} = \sqrt {-1 + \frac{\sqrt{20}}{2}} = \pm 1.11...&lt;/math&gt;

If q=+1.11 then:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{4}{2*1.11} = 1.80&lt;/math&gt;

If q=-1.11 then:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{4}{2*-1.11} = -1.80&lt;/math&gt;

Hence p+qi is:

:&lt;math&gt;1.80+1.11i, -1.80-1.11 \Rightarrow p+qi = \pm (1.80+1.11i)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since the 1980's, parenting has changed. Many parents let their children raise themselves while they watched from afar. Others became &quot;hover parents&quot; and monitored their child's every move. The views of how children are raised have never been more discussed and debated than today, and much has changed from the '''children should be seen not heard''' of only a few generations ago.

Though some may consider themselves to be &quot;expert parents&quot;, they too have many questions about how to raise their children.

The point of this book is for parents, and related interested individuals, to join together bringing tips, knowledge and references together which will help us all be better parents with less stress.
Let us build this up first with any tips you contribute by category and then expand pages as greater content comes into existence.

This book was created as the depth of the '[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting Parenting page on wikipedia.org]' is inadequate for the journey and caring and leadership role which encompasses all active parents in the parenting journey.  That page is not helpful to you as a parent, but an effective book on wikibooks can be!

== Parenting skills ==
Parenting is always an '''adventure'''- even those that consider themselves &quot;fully prepared&quot; never expect what comes next. New parents initially will be overwhelmed at the baby's constant demand for their attention. Here are some tips and things you can do to make sure your child grows up in loving family, and heads in the right direction.

Children are our future. Given the proper tools and environment they can shape the future into something beautiful. To brighten their future, parents should encourage their play, have regular conversations with the child, and develop the child's body and mind. Play is a critical aspect to all children. Child pyscologists have found that imaginative play is healthy to their growing minds and should be encouraged. Parents should talk and listen to their child on a &quot;grown up&quot; level; never condesending, playing down their ideas or using &quot;baby talk&quot;. If the child can speak full, well developed sentences, baby talk in in no way helpful. In order to develop a child's brain and body, proper care must be given. Aside from healthful meals, a good peditrician must be aquired and visited regularly. Even if the parents aren't religious, morals are critical at an early age. Right from wrong, good from bad, and basic rules are all easily developed between 3 and 6 years old .&lt;ref name=&quot;10 Tips for Positive Parenting&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Tips for Positive Parenting|url=http://www.pioneerthinking.com/ara-posparenting.html|publisher=ARA Content|author=Shay Bilchik|date=18 Feb 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the toddler years (2-5), parents should see that the child takes part in imaginative play on a daily basis. Parents may find it fun to join their child and play along. Time should be set aside every day, normally around naptime or bedtime, to read a story. This encourages the child to read and allows you to spend a peaceful moment together. You may walk in on your child holding a book upside down, trying to read for themselves. Allow them to safely explore the world around them: take nature walks, collecting interesting things you find, go bird watching and let your child &quot;talk to&quot; the birds, even a walk around the neighborhood will aid in their '''social development'''. It allows your child to interact with his neighbors and future school mates. If your child is of preschool age, regular doctor's appointments are essential. At this age children can develop sleep problems that can escalate quickly from nightmares to refusing to sleep in their own bed. It is always best to make sure your child is healthy early on and make sure no problems arise. &lt;ref name=&quot;Preschool Parenting Tips&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Preschool Parenting Tips|url=http://www.keepkidshealthy.com/preschool/preschoolquicktips.html|publisher=Keep Kids Healthy, LLC|date=16 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a parent, Try to set a side time on a regular basis to do something fun with your child.

A top priority in a parent's mind should be their child's safety. If the parents are ignorant as to what they should do regarding safety, Child Care classes should be looked in to. 
*Lying down while eating or drinking anything is a hazard. Even infants should be slightly elevated when given a bottle.
*Food, such as meats that can't be easily chewed through, should be cut into small pieces for the child to eat. 
*Toys shouldn't include small removable parts, as these are tempting and present a choking hazard.
*Swimming pools should be fenced off and locked so that the child cannot access them. If this isn't possible, remove the ladder or anything that can be used as stairs. Children are '''curious creatures''' that '''wander and explore''' their environments.

Remember to give your child unconditional love, parent them positvly, teach them good people skills and manners, and remember the importance of play and a good sense of humor. Always do your absolute best, take a break now and then, and remeber that no 2 children are completely alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proper Parenting Means Learning Successful Parenting Skills|url=http://www.parenting-healthy-children.com/proper-parenting.html|publisher=Parenting-Healthy-Children.com|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discipline is a subject widely debated; How strict? Time out? What rules? Here are a few tips:
*Discipline should be gentle enough that the child isn't fearful of you, but also strict enough that they know you mean business.
*Time outs should last no longer than an hour but no shorter than 10 minutes. If the child spends too much time in the &quot;punish chair&quot; or a corner, he will become distracted and forget why he is there in the first place. 
*While some argue that physical discipline is needed, others believe that it leads to violence in the future. Studies haven't proven this but it should be left up to the parents to decide. If physical discipline is used, it shouldn't be excessive or abusive. 3 light swats on the bottom would be sufficient. ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parenting Techniques|url=http://www.lifecho.com/parenting-techniques|publisher=Lifecho.com|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

You need to explain decisions with your children and let them talk back, at least a little bit to improve critical thinking. Not just &quot;no means no&quot; as your reason for something. A &quot;temper tantrum&quot;  should be settled quickly and quietly by explaining your house rules. An apology and a hug is to be expected after a time out. Of course when a baby or child that cannot talk goes into a fit, parents should take care to investigate what is causing the baby or child such distess, rather than discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dokoupil|first=Tony|title=In Defense of Permissive Parenting: Why Talking Back May Lead to Smarter Kids|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/blogs/the-human-condition/2009/10/21/in-defense-of-permissive-parenting-why-talking-back-may-lead-to-smarter-kids.html|newspaper=The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC|date=21 Oct 2009|archiveurl=http://archive.is/XuYT8|archivedate=30 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parenting is a hard job and these tips are just here to help parents get a better understand of how to handle their child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positive Parenting|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/positive|publisher=The Nemours Foundation|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of parenting, family and family structure on child behaviour==
The still developing mind of a child is like a sponge. A child will imitate nearly everything their parents do or say. Some will stumble around in mommy's shoes while others will watch football with daddy. Arguments should be held away from the child. They do not know exactly what is going on, only that it is something negative between their parents. The people which the are around the most, parents mainly, greatly affect a child's behavior. If a child is raised in a conservative household, in most cases he will grow up with negative feelings towards homosexuality. If a child is raised to think that &quot;Daddy is a meany&quot;, they will grow up with this thought in the back of their minds. To say &quot;Always be on your guard&quot; wouldn't be accurate: &quot;watch what you say&quot; is the more appropriate phrase.
*Censor cursing to &quot;Dang!&quot; and &quot;Shoot!&quot; 
*Don't overuse &quot;Hate&quot;; overuse &quot;Love&quot;
*The tone of voice you use when talking matters. You may get tired of talking like Snow White, but at least your child will believe everything is peaceful at home.
As parents, you must REAR your child, rather than raise. If the atmosphere in your child's home environment is a peaceful one, your child's development will shine and he will excell. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belsky|first=Jay|title=The Determinants of Parenting: A Process Model|journal=Child Development|year=1984|month=February|volume=55|issue=3|pages=83-96|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1129836?uid=3738992&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=55836820373|publisher=The Society for Research in Child Development, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travelling by car==
===Getting them in their seat belt===
*The game we find most effective is to make it a competition and say 'lets count how long it takes you to get in and buckled up' and then we count loud and fast. 
**Recently to this we've added a rhyme to the number he gets to .. ie in on count of 6 &quot;six! Pick up sticks&quot;
***For experience - start the process early - this way there will be no trauma. Baby will always help when used to situations. call it a &quot;condition&quot; for getting in the car - always sit him in the backseat, same car seat, same side... It is VERY important that you never let baby experiment or experience standing or even being in the car out of the carseat.
You may also try using those strollers that have a detachable car seat that connects to base that stays in the car - this way baby gets used to car seat before getting in the car. The trick is always starting early! 

==Bedtime==
When your child is at least 6 months old it is recommended for parents to try to solve bedtime problems. At this age the child has reached a point where they can sleep longer, they are now able to wake up and comfort themselves to fall back asleep. It may be difficult at first because the child is already used to the parents being there as soon as they start crying. Parents should gradually start ignoring the child’s crying, maybe 5 minutes for the first night and then increasing the time every night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solving Sleep Problems with Infants|url=http://www.parenting.org/article/solving-sleep-problems-infants|publisher=Boys Town Press|accessdate=6 March 2012|author=Patrick C. Friman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friman|first=Patrick C.|title=Good night, sweet dreams, I love you : now get into bed and go to sleep!|year=2005|publisher=Boys Town Press|location=Boys Town, NE|isbn=1-889322-65-2|pages=57|url=http://www.boystownpress.org/index.php/good-night-sweet-dreams-i-love-you.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Many books all say 'have a routine', (this is unhelpful on its own)
*I run the principal I call the bed machine, once the bed machine is started, it may take a while but will keep moving forward with only one destination 'BED'.
*For us we call it 'Books, Milk and bed' others do 'Bath, book and bed'.
**Establish a set order for yourself.
=== Brushing teeth ===
* We place a chair outside the bathroom which we call the 'brushing chair', which we get our son to sit on when we brush his teeth, it has greatly reduced the squirm factor
*Allowing the child to watch and practice as mommy and daddy brush their teeth will teach them to develop good brushing habits

==Meal times==
===Getting them to eat their greens===
*Scientists have proved that young children are anatomically predisposed to dislike the colour green, for reasons having to do with the developing retinal cones of the eye. Therefore it is useful to include non-green vegetables such as carrots, cauliflower, rutabaga, salsify etc.
*Foods can also be coloured to introduce fun and create an interest factor; however, artificial food colourings should not be used, as some children are allergic to them.
*Sweet vegetables are more palatable to young children such as peas, swede &amp; sweet potato.
===Table Manners===
About a century ago, children weren't allowed at the table until manners were mastered. They ate in their nursery with the nanny and came to the table as a reward for their progress or when family came to visit.
*Do not expect your child to never put their elbows on the table; remember that they are small and must support themselves. 
*All children should learn to say please and thank you but this is a courtesty extended beyond the table.
*Remeber:children learn from what their parents do. If your husband belches at the end of every meal, your child may grow to think that this is accepctable.

A smooth &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[w:set|set]] together with a collection of subsets &lt;math&gt;\{O_\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; with the following properties:

# Each &lt;math&gt;p\in\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt; lies in at least one &lt;math&gt;O_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{M}=\cup_\alpha O_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
# For each &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, there is a [[Wikipedia:bijection|bijection]] &lt;math&gt;\psi_\alpha:O_\alpha\longrightarrow U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an [[wikipedia:open set|open subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; 
# If &lt;math&gt;O_\alpha\cap O_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is non-empty, then the map &lt;math&gt;\psi_\alpha\circ\psi_\beta^{-1}:\psi_\beta[O_\alpha\cap O_\beta]\longrightarrow\psi_\alpha[O_\alpha\cap O_\beta]&lt;/math&gt; is [[Wikipedia:smooth function|smooth]].

The bijections are called ''charts'' or ''coordinate systems''. The collection of charts is called an ''atlas.'' The atlas induces a [[Wikipedia:topology|topology]] on ''M'' such that the charts are [[wikipedia:continuous function|continuous]]. The domains &lt;math&gt;O_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the charts are called ''coordinate regions''. 
== Examples ==
* Euclidean space, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with a single chart (&lt;math&gt;O=\mathbb{R}^n,\psi=&lt;/math&gt; [[wikipedia:identity map|identity map]]) is a trivial example of a manifold.
* 2-sphere &lt;math&gt; S^2 = \{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 | x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
:Notice that &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; is not an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;. The identity map on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; restricted to &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; does not satisfy the requirements of a chart since its range is not open in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3.&lt;/math&gt;
:The usual spherical coordinates map &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; to a region in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, but again the range is not open in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2.&lt;/math&gt; Instead, one can define two charts each defined on a subset of &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; that omits a half-circle. If these two half-circles do not intersect, the union of the domains of the two charts is all of &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt;. With these two charts, &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; becomes a 2-dimensional manifold. It can be shown that no single chart can possibly cover all of &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; if the topology of &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt; is to be the usual one.

:''Main article: [[Wikipedia:Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild metric]]''

The '''Schwarzschild metric''' can be put into the form 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^{2} = -c^2 \left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^2 r} \right) dt^2 + \left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\right)^{-1}dr^2+ r^2 d\Omega^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wikipedia:gravitational constant|gravitational constant]], &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as the [[wikipedia:mass|mass]] of the gravitating object, and

:&lt;math&gt;d\Omega^2 = d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

is the standard metric on the [[wikipedia:2-sphere|2-sphere]]. The constant

:&lt;math&gt;r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} &lt;/math&gt;

is called the '''Schwarzschild radius'''.


Note that as &lt;math&gt;M\to 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;r \rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; one recovers the [[Wikipedia:Minkowski metric|Minkowski metric]]:

:&lt;math&gt;ds^{2} = -c^2dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, this means that around small or far away from any gravitating bodies we expect space to be nearly flat. Metrics with this property are called [[wikipedia:asymptotically flat|asymptotically flat]].

Note that there are two singularities in the Schwarzschild metric: at r=0 and &lt;math&gt;r=r_{s}=\frac{2GM}{c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be shown that while the latter singularity can be transformed away with a change of metric, the former is not.  In other words, r=0 is a bonafide singularity in the metric.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Combining letters to form words in Arabic is somewhat different from how it's done in English.&lt;br&gt;

First of all, there are no redundant letters in the Arabic alphabet. There's ''almost'' never a doubt as in &quot;should I use ie or ei? should I use y or i?&quot;. If it sounds like ي then you use ي, there is no other option. (You should be familiar with the Arabic alphabet before reading this article.)&lt;br&gt;
There are two exceptions (that I'm aware of):&lt;br&gt;
* Some forms of the hamza.&lt;br&gt;
* The alef-maqsoora.&lt;br&gt;

and two issues which can be tricky:&lt;br&gt;
* The taa-marboota.&lt;br&gt;
* The tanween.&lt;br&gt;

For the alef-maqsoora, there is a rule which you can use to figure out when you have to use it and when you don't, but it maybe a bit too advanced for this lesson. The same applies for taa-marboota, and the tanween, there are rules which tell you what to do, but they maybe too advanced for the purposes of this lesson.

Second, you need to be careful with vowels. There are two types of vowels: letters, and Harakat. If the vowel is short, it's not written as a letter, rather as a symbol that appears above or below the letter which proceeds it.&lt;br&gt;
For example, the English word &quot;dish&quot; has a short vowel between the 'd' sound and the 'sh' sound; in Arabic, such a vowel wouldn't be written as a letter.&lt;br&gt;
Consider the word:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;سَلام&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
which is pronounced 'salaam', with a short 'a' sound after the 's', and a long 'a' sound after the 'l'.&lt;br&gt;
We used four letters to write the word: &lt;br&gt;
س 'seen'&lt;br&gt;
ل 'laam'&lt;br&gt;
ا 'alef'&lt;br&gt;
م 'meem'&lt;br&gt;
Note that there's no 'alef' after the 'seen'; that's because it's a short 'aa' sound, thus it's not written as a letter, rather, a 'fatHa' appears on top of the 'seen'.&lt;br&gt;
The fatHa is a straight line that appears above the letter to indicate a short 'aa' sound the follows the letter.&lt;br&gt;

With that said, you need to note that there are only three vowel sounds in Arabic:&lt;br&gt;

aaaaa - represented with an 'alef' ا if it's long (as in man, can, dash), and a fatHa َ if it's short (as in let, bet, mesh).&lt;br&gt;

eeiii - represented with a 'yaa' ي if it's long (as in feel, heal), and with a kasra ِ if it's short (as in dish, fish.)&lt;br&gt;

ooooo - represented with a 'waw' و if it's long (as in food, mood), and with a dhamma ُ  if it's short (as in .. can't think of a proper example! except maybe mashrum.)
Note that this sound is *not* the same as in &quot;hawk&quot; or &quot;poke&quot;!!&lt;br&gt;

To sum up: there are three vowels: alef, waw, ya' ا, و , ي and three Harakat: &lt;br&gt;
fatHa: a short stroke above the letter to indicate a short 'aa' sound.&lt;br&gt;
kasra: a short stroke below the letter to indicate a short 'ee' sound.&lt;br&gt;
Dhamma: a small 'waw' و above the letter to indicate a short 'oo' sound.&lt;br&gt;

Here are some examples:
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مَقال&lt;/font&gt; ma-qaal &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;رَصِيد&lt;/font&gt; ra-Seed &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;حَرَكَة&lt;/font&gt; Ha-ra-kah &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;تَمثِيل&lt;/font&gt; tam-theel &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مُلتُقٌى&lt;/font&gt; mul-ta-qa &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مِفتَاح&lt;/font&gt; mif-taaH &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There are two more things I want to talk about:&lt;br&gt;
Taa Marbota (connected taa'):&lt;br&gt;
This letter can only appear at the end of the letter, it looks just like 'haa' هـ in its final shape, except it has two dots on top. ـة or ة &lt;br&gt;
When this letter appears in a word, it means this: if you stop at the end of the word, you pronounce it like a 'haa' ـه&lt;br&gt;
i.e. حركة would be pronounced &quot;Harakah&quot;&lt;br&gt;
However, if you don't stop talking when you finish saying the word, then you would pronounce it as a 'taa' ـت&lt;br&gt;
i.e. الحركة مفيدة would be pronounced: &quot;alHarakatu Mofeedah&quot;&lt;br&gt;

The taa-marboota is usually used to indicate &quot;female&quot; nouns and adjectives.&lt;br&gt;

Alef Maqsoora&lt;br&gt;

'''Birkhoff's theorem''' 

:Any spherically symmetric solution of the vacuum field equations must be static and asymptotically flat. 

''proof''
...
[[wikipedia:Q.E.D.|Q.E.D.]]

This means that the exterior solution must be given by the [[General Relativity/Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild metric]].

'''Reissner-Nordström black hole''' is a black hole that carries [[wikipedia:electric charge|electric charge]] &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, no [[wikipedia:angular momentum|angular momentum]], and [[wikipedia:mass|mass]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. General properties of such a black hole are described in the article [[wikipedia:charged black hole|charged black hole]].

It is described by the electric field of a point-like charged particle, and especially by the '''Reissner-Nordström metric''' that generalizes the Schwarzschild metric of an electrically neutral black hole:

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=-\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}+\frac{Q^2}{r^2}\right)dt^2 + \left(1-\frac{2M}{r}+\frac{Q^2}{r^2}\right)^{-1} dr^2 +r^2 d\Omega^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where we have used units with the [[wikipedia:speed of light|speed of light]] and the [[wikipedia:gravitational constant|gravitational constant]] equal to one (&lt;math&gt;c=G=1&lt;/math&gt;) and where the angular part of the metric is

:&lt;math&gt;d\Omega^2 \equiv d\theta^2 +\sin^2 \theta\cdot d\phi^2&lt;/math&gt;

The electromagnetic potential is

:&lt;math&gt;A = -\frac{Q}{r}dt&lt;/math&gt;.

While the charged black holes with &lt;math&gt;|Q| &lt; M&lt;/math&gt; (especially with &lt;math&gt;|Q| &lt;&lt; M&lt;/math&gt;) are similar to the Schwarzschild black hole, they have two horizons: the [[wikipedia:event horizon|event horizon]] and an internal [[wikipedia:Cauchy horizon|Cauchy horizon]].  The horizons are located at &lt;math&gt;r = r_\pm := M \pm \sqrt{M^2-Q^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  These horizons merge for &lt;math&gt;|Q|=M&lt;/math&gt; which is the case of an [[wikipedia:extremal black hole|extremal black hole]].

== Important Note ==
I added an important note at the bottom of the page regarding the fact that although the United Nations is classified under Government on WikiBooks, it's actually not a governmental body. Go check out ''''Everyone's United Nations''''. It's a book released by the U.N. annually which covers the basics of the UN and on the very first few pages they explicitly say that the U.N. has no sovereignty of its own and is '''not''' a government.

Began a detailed description of limit-stop screw adjustment. This module needs to be expanded to cover barrel adjusters and their relationship to indexed and non-indexed shifters and related adjustment. Ideally, a standard glossary should be referenced  - or established if none exists - so that terminological issues in this domain are minimised. Certainly needs more work on intra-wikipedia links. Retained original link to the external site, as it is among the best discussions of the subject matter available (to date). -- 30-08-2006 michael at cam org

This page needs to be more than a simple reference to an external link

== Division of sections ==

Would anyone object to creating separate sections for rear and front derailers?  All of the general topic lesson material could be put under derailers and the specifics could be addressed in each sub article.  I think it would be a good idea as a person may only be interested in the specifics of replacing or adjusting a front or rear derailer.  It would also allow for more comprehensive explanation of the specific topic.  [[User:Alan.ca|Alan.ca]] 03:40, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

==It needs the basic thing first==
What is needed I think is a clear description of the alignment of a basic rear-derailleur.   After that, other things would be justified, and whether or not several pages are needed to cover it should be certainly be considered. 

I could not quite follow the description as it stands as a practical how-to, and eventually went to the site at Park Tools; but their version needs too many pairs of hands or too much equipment. I hope that a few changes here will not be resented too much.   Let me know here if there are ''fundamental'' objections to anything that is done, since I am not aware of the possible proprietary issues.

The photos are about the best that I have seen on the subject.   Can the permissions stand the making of labelled copies?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Topicality is the questionable stock issue.  Some teams argue that topicality is not a &quot;voting issue,&quot; and should not influence the judge's decision.  However, topicality can become a voting issue if the negative establishes good standards and voters (see below).  Topicality arguments are run in the following way. 

Foremost comes the resolution.  The resolution for 2005-2006 is &quot;Resolved: That the United States Federal Government should substantially decrease its authority either to detain without charge or search without probable cause.&quot;

A topicality argument suffices from the Affirmative team not meeting the parameters of the resolution.  In other words, the resolution says that the problem should be &quot;substantially decreased.&quot;  The argument would then be that the affirmative is not substantially decrease the authority of the government.

An untopical case would be one that only says that cops can no longer search without probable cause - thus not substantially decreasing the problem.  

Likewise, topicality arguments can be ran on any word in the resolution.  A popular argument for this year's topic is &quot;or.&quot;  If the affirmative case tries to fix both detainment and search and seizure, then it could be non-topical. 

Topicality arguments are laid out in the following manner:

#Definition - definition of the word that you are running topicality on.
#Link - plank in affirmative plan that proves that they are not substantially decreasing, or solvency cards which do not prove the extent of the decrease.
#Standards - why the negative's interpretation of the resolution/definition of the word is superior. Possible standards include the argument that a definition from a law dictionary is superior, or that a definition NOT from a law dictionary is superior, that the negative's interpretation provides the fairest division of argumentative ground, that the negative's interpretation provides the best opportunity for education, etc.
#Voters  - why the judge should vote on topicality in the round. The most popular is &quot;abuse,&quot; or it is abusive to the negative team to have to argue a case that meets both standards instead of the one that the resolution requires.



Topicality arguments are one of the greatest arguments in policy debate, however some affirmatives will argue that it should not be voted on (or even used as an independent reason to vote against the negative) because it is frequently run as a time suck. Topicality is an a priori issue for the affirmative: if they lose topicality, they lose the round. Therefore, negatives are able to run quick and usually inapplicable topicality arguments that the affirmative must now dedicate their own speech time to addressing. This tactic is what is referred to as a time suck and is sometimes argued as being unfair by affirmative teams.  Some affirmative teams will claim that this is a reason to consider topicality to be a &quot;reverse voter,&quot; meaning that if the negative loses the topicality argument that they brought up as a time suck, they should lose the round as punishment. The reverse voter argument is generally not successful unless the negative is running topicality against a very clearly topical affirmative.

This is an easier version of [[Cookbook:Peanut Brittle|Peanut Brittle]] that can be prepared in under 10 minutes using a microwave.

==Ingredients==
*1 cup sugar
*1/2 cup white corn syrup
*1 cup roasted peanuts
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]
*1 teaspoon baking soda

==Procedure==
*Lightly grease cookie sheet and set aside.
*In 1 1/2 qt. casserole dish stir together sugar and syrup. Microwave at high for 4 minutes.
*Stir in peanuts. Microwave at high for 3-5 minutes or until light brown.
*Add butter and vanilla, blending well. Microwave at high 1-2 minutes more. Peanuts will be lightly browned and syrup very hot.
*Add baking soda and stir gently until light and foamy.
*Pour mixture onto greased cookie sheet. Let cool 1/2 hour to 1 hour. When cool, break into small pieces and store in airtight container.
*Makes about 1 pound.

==Tips==
*Take care not to overcook or under cook. Overcooking results in a burnt taste, and under cooking results in a taffy-like consistency that sticks to the teeth.
*Microwave times will depend on the power of your individual microwave. It may take a few experiments before you determine what is the right cooking time.
*If you start seeing part of the mixture turning brown, it is probably beginning to burn. Remove immediately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==''=&gt;'' Lambda Operator==
I may add this section, but currently am busy with school. When learning C#, I saw this a few times and could not figure out what it was. Try Googling for &quot;C# =&gt;&quot;. I nevertheless finally realized this was an operator for lambda functions. I cam here to find out what it was and there was nothing.

==''Read'' column==
I added the ''Read'' column because one of the obstacles to some beginners in the C family of languages (and indeed one of the great merits to those more experienced) appears to be its terse, symbolic representation. A guide to reading those symbols seems to help some beginners. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 22:10, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

==Prefix vs. postfix==
Maybe I'm just being OCD about this, but how did the terms &quot;prefix increment/decrement&quot; and &quot;postfix increment/decrement&quot; not make it into this page?  Anyone else think they should be there, or am I the only one?  --[[User:Nanodeath|Nanodeath]] 02:23, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

:They're in the arithmetic section as &lt;code&gt;a++&lt;/code&gt; etc. [[User:Rodasmith|Rodasmith]] 21:31, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

==?? operator==
Where is the ?? operator, for checking if a nullable type is null? --[[User:134.121.148.200|134.121.148.200]] 12:22, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

Hi, when you say &quot;molasses&quot;, can I just use either dark or light molasses?

== Taste Great! ==

I just wish there were something that says just how small &quot;small&quot; is.

I made them about.. eh... 1.5-1.75&quot; in diameter.

Maybe 1&quot; would have been better?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Module 2881 The Market System

This module provides an introduction as to why economic choices have to be made and how
the market model operates. The subject content covers the basic principles of:
* why individuals, organisations and societies have to make choices;
* how competitive markets work;
* the objectives and competitive behaviour of firms and how explanations of market structure are used by economists to explain this behaviour.

==Managing Scarce Resources==
The main economic problem is scarce resources in relation to infinite wants. Everybody must make choices, in economics this is known as opporunity cost.
Opportunity Cost:
In decision making the next best alternative that could have been chosen.
The opportunity cost thus leads to an important tool in economics that is Marginal analysis.
Marginal analysis:
An approach to economic decision making based on considering the additional(marginal) benefits and costs of a small change in behavior.

==Competitive markets and how they work==

==Firms and how they operate==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Salsa Variants ==

I recently moved to Southern California and discovered that Salsa down here refers not just to the classic tomato / cilantro &quot;salsa roja&quot; described in the recipe page here, but to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_%28sauce%29 a whole variety of tasty sauces]. I suggest that this Salsa page should become a disambiguation page for the various types of salsa.



== &quot;A bunch of cilantro&quot; ==

Hi, I don't know how much a &quot;bunch&quot; is.  HOw many tablespoons or leafs would you say?

A &quot;bunch&quot; probably means the bundle that cilantro is often sold as. About a half cup, chopped, would be reasonable. You might like more.

==Onion==
1 teaspoon fresh chopped onion, seems as extremely little, maybe it should have read 1 fresh chopped onion?

==Tomatoes==

Canned tomatoes? This seems very odd. Salsa should have a fresher taste, which would be destroyed by using canned tomatoes. --[[User:205.188.117.74|205.188.117.74]] 01:02, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

== tomatoes, onions... ==

Instead of canned tomatoes, you can use 4 fresh tomatoes, such as roma or hot house. As you cut them up, be sure to get rid of the seeds and after you cut them, let them sit for ten minutes to allow any excess moisture to evaporate so your salsa isn't too wet.

Also, use a half onion, very well cut up to make the salsa good.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p&gt;Brain scans of adult stutterers have found two abnormalities associated with stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One neurological abnormality is &lt;i&gt;underactivity&lt;/i&gt; in the auditory processing area (this chapter). The other neurological abnormality is &lt;i&gt;overactivity&lt;/i&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;MotorLearning.shtml&quot;&gt;speech motor control area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This combination of over- and underactivity may explain why the &amp;quot;conventional wisdom&amp;quot; told to stutterers is a contradiction of trying harder and relaxation, e.g. &amp;quot;try harder to relax.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No brain scans have done of stuttering children. We don't know whether these two neurological abnormalities &lt;i&gt;cause&lt;/i&gt; stuttering or &lt;i&gt;are caused by&lt;/i&gt; stuttering. It's possible that stuttering causes a child's brain to develop abnormally in these two areas. It's also possible that some children have one or both neurological abnormalities before they start stuttering, which cause them to stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is certain exactly what's wrong with adult stutterer's auditory processing area. Stutterers have normal hearing, i.e., there's nothing wrong with our ears. A &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn31&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that adult stutterers have an inability to integrate auditory and somatic processing. I.e., we may have an inability to compare what we hear ourselves saying to what we feel our muscles doing. This may explain why we have poorly coordinated speech muscle movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;Anti-StutteringDevices&quot;&gt;Altered Auditory Feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Changing how stutterers hear their voices improves fluency. This can be done in many ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Speaking in chorus with another person.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hearing your voice distorted.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hearing your vocal fold vibration (phonation) without hearing the articulation of your lips, jaw, and tongue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hearing a synthesized sound mimicking your phonation (masking auditory feedback, or MAF).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hearing your voice delayed a fraction of a second (delayed auditory feedback, or DAF).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hearing your voice shifted higher or lower in pitch (frequency-shifted auditory feedback, or FAF).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Switching your voice from one ear to the other twenty times per second (binaural switching auditory feedback).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together these phenomena are called &lt;i&gt;altered auditory feedback&lt;/i&gt;. No studies have investigated the effects of altered auditory feedback on stutterers' brains. My hypothesis is that introducing errors targeted at the area that integrates auditory and somatic processing increases blood flow to that area. Such errors disconnect how you hear your voice from what you feel your muscles doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I.e., hearing what you are saying out of sync with what you feel your muscles doing raises a red flag. The red flag is raised in the area that is abnormally underactive in stutterers. It's like a poor little overlooked village suddenly saying, &amp;quot;The British are coming! Eureka! There's gold in them thar hills! We've struck oil! Aliens have landed!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can picture wagon trains, locomotives, and paratroopers descending on this sleepy little burg. In brain terms, more blood flows to this area. The activity level increases to normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The errors must &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; raise red flags in other brain areas, such as language processing. E.g., I built a device that, when you walked up to Fred and said, &amp;quot;Hi, Fred,&amp;quot; the device whispered in your ear, &amp;quot;Hi, Steve.&amp;quot; It didn't improve fluency. It just stopped everyone&amp;#151;stutterers or non-stutterers&amp;#151;from talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When stutterers hear altered auditory feedback, something feels &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;. You realize that all your life something was wrong but you didn't know it. Speaking just feels natural, like this is how we're supposed to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, non-stutterers can't stand altered auditory feedback. I've amused many non-stutterers by putting a DAF/FAF anti-stuttering device on them and telling them to count to twenty. Most can't get to ten. They repeat or skip numbers, or giggle uncontrollably, then rip the headphones off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my hypothesis is correct, then altered auditory feedback increases blood flow to non-stutterers auditory/somatic integration area, raising activity to an abnormally high level. Too much activity is as bad as not enough activity. Interestingly, the effects of too much activity in this area are somewhat like stuttering&amp;#151;repeating words, or not being able to get words out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Immediate Effects of Anti-Stuttering Devices&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The most effective types of altered auditory feedback are delayed auditory feedback (DAF) and frequency-shifted auditory feedback (FAF). Each reduce stuttering about 70%, immediately, without training, speech therapy, mental effort, or abnormal-sounding speech. You just put the headphones on and talk. Combined DAF/FAF reduces stuttering about 80%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; say that DAF always makes you talk slowly and monotonously. They say that you can talk slowly without DAF so the devices are unnecessary. But several studies have shown that DAF (and FAF) reduce stuttering at normal and faster than normal speaking rates. The first such study was published in 1993. This is yet another example of Ph.D. university &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; who claim to be scientists but instead tout unscientiﬁc &amp;quot;old wives’ tales&amp;quot; and don't read the research journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70-80% is the average improvement found in dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn32&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, with hundreds of stutterers. Rarely does DAF and/or FAF improve anyone's speech more than 90%, or less than 50%. If auditory processing underactivity were the only cause of stuttering, then DAF/FAF devices would make all stutterers 100% fluent. The 70-80% effectiveness shows that auditory processing underactivity is an important factor in stuttering, but not the only factor. To get closer to 100% fluency an anti-stuttering device has to be combined with speech therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Should Adults Use Anti-Stuttering Devices?&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The only treatment for the auditory processing abnormality is an altered auditory feedback device. No speech therapy can fix this abnormality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people overcome stuttering by treating the other factors, e.g., fluency shaping therapy. But using an anti-stuttering device in conjunction with other therapies will make the other therapies easier, faster, and more effective. You'll then use your anti-stuttering device less and less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have success with speech therapy and can talk fluently in most  situations, there will be a few situations in which you stutter. Public speaking is usually that situation. You may want an anti-stuttering device for public speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I keep an anti-stuttering device plugged into my telephone. I pick up the phone and talk fluently. After a few calls my speech is improved for the rest of the day. Many &lt;a href=&quot;#Subsidies&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; provide telephone-compatible anti-stuttering devices free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Should Children Use Anti-Stuttering Devices?&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Children under six shouldn't use anti-stuttering devices. Childhood stuttering therapy is usually 100% effective, so anti-stuttering devices are unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven- to thirteen-year-olds can use anti-stuttering devices under the supervision of a speech-language pathologist or a parent trained by a speech-language pathologist, or for &lt;i&gt;limited&lt;/i&gt; unsupervised uses such as a classroom presentation. If your child gets speech therapy in school only twenty minutes each week, buying a device can enable your child to do therapy at home for thirty minutes each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don't know whether children who stutter have the same neurological abnormalities that adult stutterers have. Altering a child's brain activity might cause his brain to develop in a different way. &lt;i&gt;Extensive&lt;/i&gt; use of an anti-stuttering device might cause the child's brain to develop normal auditory processing and the child would outgrow stuttering. But maybe extensive use of an anti-stuttering device would cause the child's brain to develop in another, unknown abnormal way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some anti-stuttering devices impair the user's hearing. Some devices occlude (block) the ear that the device is in. And some devices pick up, distort, and amplify &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;background noise&lt;/a&gt;. If a child can't hear his teacher, he'll fall behind in school. He might get hit by a bus that he couldn't hear coming. Some users have reported symptoms of permanent hearing damage, such as ringing in the ears or pain from loud noises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=DAF&gt;Delayed Auditory Feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;If you've decided not to try an anti-stuttering device, you can skip the rest of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to talk at a normal speaking rate, set the DAF delay between &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn33&quot;&gt;50 and 75 milliseconds&lt;/a&gt;. Don't use a delay longer than 75 milliseconds unless you're using &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;slow speech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen this scenario over and over. A stutterer gets a 50% improvement at 50 milliseconds. He gets a 75% improvement at 75 milliseconds. He sees that the dial goes up to 200 milliseconds. He thinks, &amp;quot;I'll crank up this baby! I'll redline it! I'll turn it up all the way to 200 milliseconds and I'll be 200% fluent!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong. 200 milliseconds is for talking five to ten times slower. You can force yourself to ignore a 200 millisecond delay and talk at a normal speaking rate. You can train your auditory processing to be even less active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you read that? Used incorrectly, a DAF device might make your auditory processing underactivity worse! This may explain why some stutterers have reported that a DAF device lost effectiveness or &lt;a href=&quot;Footnotes.shtml#ftn8&quot;&gt;wore off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;Long-TermDAF&quot;&gt;Long-Term Effects of DAF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Nine adult stutterers used DAF devices thirty minutes per day, for &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn33&quot;&gt;three months&lt;/a&gt;. The thirty minutes consisted of ten minutes reading aloud, a ten-minute conversation with a family member, and a ten-minute telephone call. The subjects received no speech therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;vanborsel.gif&quot; width=432 height=265&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Long-Term Effects of DAF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The device used was the &lt;a href=&quot;SchoolDAF.shtml&quot;&gt;School DAF&lt;/a&gt;, made by Casa Futura Technologies (my company), with a binaural (two ears) headset. The subjects were allowed to set the delay where they wanted. Most selected delays around 100 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the three months of DAF use, the subjects stuttered on 37% of words, on average. When they put on the DAF device their stuttering dropped to 10%. I.e., the device improved their speech about 70%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months later the subjects stuttered on 17% of words, when not using the DAF device. When wearing the DAF device they stuttered on 13% of words.

&lt;p&gt;This shows that, when not wearing the devices, the subjects' stuttering diminished from 37% of words to 17% of words, or a 55% improvement. This is &amp;quot;carryover fluency.&amp;quot; Put another way, the device trained the users to no longer need the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase (from 10% to 13%) in stuttering when wearing the devices wasn't statistically significant. Examining this more closely, stuttering when wearing the device increased only for &amp;quot;automatic speech,&amp;quot; such as reciting days of the week, and for repeating words and sentences after the examiner. No change in effectiveness was found in conversations or in a &amp;quot;picture description&amp;quot; task. This suggests that any &amp;quot;wearing off&amp;quot; effects occurred in less-important speaking situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;carryover fluency&amp;quot; effect was the same across all speaking tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two other studies combined speech therapy with a DAF device. One &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn35&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was of adults, the &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn36&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; of children. Both studies found that combining DAF and stuttering therapy trained the subjects to speak fluently (less than 2% stuttering) and no longer need the devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;FAF&quot;&gt;Frequency-Shifted Auditory Feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Frequency-shifted auditory feedback (FAF) shifts the pitch of your voice in your earphones. A FAF upshift makes you hear your voice sounding like Mickey Mouse. A FAF downshift makes you hear your voice sounding like a &lt;a href=&quot;Footnotes.shtml#ftn10&quot;&gt;gravel-voiced radio announcer&lt;/a&gt; saying his station's call letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarter-octave pitch shift reduces stuttering about 35%. A half-octave pitch shift reduces stuttering about 65-70%. A full-octave pitch shift reduces stuttering about 70-75%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting pitch up or down is equally effective, in short-term studies, when the stutterer is wearing the device. But there may be a long-term difference between an up- or a downshift. FAF causes &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn37&quot;&gt;non-stutterers&lt;/a&gt; to speak at a higher or lower vocal pitch, depending on whether the device is set for an up or down frequency shift. This higher or lower pitch vocal pitch results from changing vocal fold tension. In other words, FAF induces changes in vocal fold tension in non-stutterers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;FAFeffect.gif&quot; width=432 height=345&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;FAF Stuttering Reduction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll see in the chapter on &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;speech motor control&lt;/a&gt; that vocal fold relaxation is a primary target of fluency shaping therapy. I.e., putting on a FAF device might induce in seconds what takes weeks in speech therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn38&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that my company's FAF devices, set for a half-octave downshift, didn't cause a change in vocal pitch in stutterers. But speech clinics have reported that my FAF devices induce vocal fold relaxation in stutterers. I've seen this myself. Usually stutterers need a greater pitch shift, between one-half and one octave down. Also the study used older headphones which lacked the bass response of today's headphones. I believe that a new study, using one-half or one octave downshifts (the gravel-voice) would find that the current devices induce vocal fold relaxation. I've also seen that FAF downshifts induce a slower speaking rate, similar to DAF. If this is true, then a FAF downshift should result in long-term carryover fluency and no longer needing the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a FAF upshift (the Mickey Mouse voice) appears to induce vocal fold tension. And I've seen FAF upshifts induce faster speaking rates. If this is true, then a FAF upshift should result in poor long-term performance (e.g., no carryover fluency, and possibly &amp;quot;wearing off).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Types of FAF&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;All of the published studies of FAF used &lt;i&gt;octave-scale&lt;/i&gt; FAF. Octave-scale FAF requires lots of &lt;a href=&quot;Footnotes.shtml#ftn11&quot;&gt;computing power&lt;/a&gt;. My company's devices use octave-scale FAF. When you set my devices to a one-octave upshift, the 125-Hz fundamental frequency of an adult male voice is shifted up to 250 Hz. The 250 Hz first overtone of your voice is shifted to 500 Hz. The 500 Hz second overtone of your voice is shifted to 1000 Hz. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you instead use a one-octave downshift, your 125 Hz voice is shifted in your earphones to 62 Hz. Your 250 Hz first overtone is shifted to 125 Hz, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;octaveFAF.jpg&quot; width=440 height=183&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Octave-Scale vs. Frequency-Compression FAF&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the tiny computers in hearing aids don't have enough processing power to produce octave-scale FAF. Instead, a simpler process uses &lt;a href=&quot;Footnotes.shtml#ftn12&quot;&gt;frequency compression/expansion&lt;/a&gt; FAF. The upshift adds 500 Hz to your voice (or 1000 Hz or 2000 Hz, depending on the setting). Thus, your 125 Hz fundamental frequency is shifted to 625 Hz&amp;#151;more than two octaves up! Your 250 Hz first overtone is shifted to 750 Hz. Your 500 Hz second overtone is shifted to 1000 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you switch frequency compression/expansion to downshift or &lt;i&gt;subtract&lt;/i&gt; 500 Hz from your voice, your 125 Hz fundamental frequency vanishes. 125 Hz minus 500 Hz is nothing (there are no negative frequencies). The 250 Hz first overtone of your voice also vanishes. And the 500 Hz second overtone of your voice vanishes. You can only hear the weak third (1000 Hz) and higher overtones of your voice. When I tried a hearing aid-style DAF/FAF device, I heard my voice in my ear &lt;i&gt;rise&lt;/i&gt; in pitch as the FAF was adjusted lower!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No published studies have investigated whether frequency compression/expansion FAF has an effect on stuttering. From what consumers and clinicians have told me, upward frequency compression FAF seems to have good immediate effects but poor long-term results. Downward frequency expansion FAF appears to have little or no effect on stuttering (in contrast, downward octave-scale FAF has excellent immediate and long-term results).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;LongTermDAFFAF&quot;&gt;Long-Term Effects of DAF/FAF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn39&quot;&gt;Eight subjects&lt;/a&gt; (four adults, four children) used a hearing aid-style DAF/FAF device about seven hours per day, for four months. The delay was set at 60 milliseconds and the FAF at 500 Hz up (about two octaves). The subjects received brief speech therapy, specifically to prolong vowels and use &amp;quot;starter sounds&amp;quot; such as &amp;quot;um&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ah.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;speecheasy.jpg&quot; width=440 height=310&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;Long-term effectiveness of hearing aid-style DAF/FAF device&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the &lt;a href=&quot;#Long-TermDAF&quot;&gt;three-month DAF study&lt;/a&gt;, a small &amp;quot;wearing off&amp;quot; effect appears in the chart but isn't statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the three-month DAF study, the &amp;quot;carryover fluency&amp;quot; effect is small and statistically insignificant. Did the 500 Hz upshift induce vocal fold tension and/or a faster speaking rate, thus canceling the long-term benefits of DAF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or does using an anti-stuttering device half an hour a day produces better long term results than using it seven hours a day (see &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Practice Scheduling&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;MAF&quot;&gt;Masking Auditory Feedback (MAF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;If you have silent blocks, in which you can't make a sound, you'll want a device with masking auditory feedback (MAF). You push a button and the device pulls you out of the block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAF is a synthesized sine wave at your fundamental frequency. This sound fools your brain into thinking that your vocal folds are vibrating. Your vocal folds relax and start vibrating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Edinburgh Masker, popular in the 1980s, helped many stutterers improve their speech over time, until they no longer needed the device. Other stutterers found that the device &amp;quot;wore off&amp;quot; and became ineffective. Still other stutterers have used the device for more than twenty years with no carryover or &amp;quot;wearing off.&amp;quot; No &lt;a href=&quot;Footnotes.shtml#ftn13&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; investigated why the device had different effects on different people. My guess is that the device made users talk louder, which increases vocal fold tension, and some users habituated to speaking with too-tense vocal folds. For the users who developed carryover fluency, the device may have helped them overcome fears and anxieties, or they may have used the device to enhance stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;SoundQuality&quot;&gt;Sound Quality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Different anti-stuttering devices have different effects, due to differences in sound quality. It's like the difference between listening to Beethoven at a concert hall, or as a cellphone ringtone. It's also the difference between an effective and ineffective device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Frequency Range&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Different anti-stuttering devices have different frequency ranges. Generally, the bigger the microphone and earphones, the wider the frequency range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My company's devices have a flat frequency response from 60 to 5000 Hz. This is the range of human voices, plus additional low range for FAF downshifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, hearing aids usually have a frequency range of 200 to 7000 Hz. The frequency ranges typically aren't flat, but instead are tuned to sound best somewhere around &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn40&quot;&gt;3000 or 4000 Hz&lt;/a&gt; (where most people lose their hearing). The devices can't reproduce the low range of human voices, especially the fundamental frequency of phonation that's key to stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Monaural vs. Binaural Sound&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Binaural (two ears) sound is &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn41&quot;&gt;25% more effective&lt;/a&gt; than monaural (one ear) sound. Some devices can be either binaural or monaural. Other devices are monaural only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;Warranties&quot;&gt;Warranties, Returns and Repairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Read price sheets and warranties carefully. Are there hidden charges? Are the extra charges refundable if you return the device? How long is your trial period for returning the device? Do you get a full or partial refund?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toss the device onto a hard floor (before you pay for it!). How breakable is it? How long is the warranty? Are repairs covered in all situations, or excluded if it was your fault that the device broke?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How easy would it be to lose a device, especially for a child?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask about the company's return rates. My company's return rate is less than 1%. Some companies have much higher return rates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;BackgroundNoise&quot;&gt;Background Noise Elimination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Some anti-stuttering devices work well in quiet speech clinics, but are unusable in a noisy restaurant. A variety of features help solve the background noise problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Noise-Canceling Microphones&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Positioned correctly, a &lt;i&gt;noise-canceling directional microphone&lt;/i&gt; eliminates background noise at the source. In contrast, the omnidirectional microphones in hearing aids pick up background noises louder than your voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Push-To-Talk Button&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;push to talk&amp;quot; button also eliminates background noise. You push a button and the device switches sound on. You let go of the button and the sound switches off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In noisy environments you're usually in a group. E.g., you go out to a restaurant with three friends. You'll talk one-fourth of the time. Most of the time you sit and listen, with clear hearing. When you have something to say, you push the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also works well for a child in school, who mostly listens and occasionally is called on by the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;High-Frequency Filters&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Most anti-stuttering devices have high-frequency filters to reduce noise above your vocal range. Some devices have adjustable filters, so that a man with a deep voice can set his device to filter out more background noise than a woman or a child with a high voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Voice Activation&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Voice activation switches on sound when the user talks, and switches off sound when the user stops talking. That is, if the device has a noise-canceling directional microphone. If the device has an omnidirectional microphone, loud noises switch on sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My company's Pocket Speech Lab analyzes your vocal fold tension and switches on DAF/FAF when you tense your vocal folds, before you stutter. It switches off sound when you're speaking with relaxed vocal folds, or not talking (see &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Vocal Frequency Biofeedback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Dynamic Expansion&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Some devices have dynamic expansion. This makes loud sounds louder and quiet sounds quieter. If you're using a noise-canceling directional microphone this makes your voice louder and background sounds quieter. With an omnidirectional microphone it can make your voice quieter and background noise louder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Acoustical Transparency&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Listening to someone talk, while you wear a DAF device that's picking up the other person's voice, is like reading the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;difficulttohear.gif&quot; width=440 height=27&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That says, &amp;quot;difficult to hear another person speaking.&amp;quot; You hear the person speaking twice, with the words out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, small FAF pitch shifts, without a DAF delay, have little impact on your ability to &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn42&quot;&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt;. It's like hearing music played on a violin vs. on a viola. Or hearing your friend's voice drop a little when recovering from a cold. This is known as &amp;quot;acoustically transparent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;Subsidies&quot;&gt;Finding Help Paying for an Anti-Stuttering Device&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many states, including Texas, California, Massachusetts, Georgia, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Arizona have &lt;a href=&quot;discounts.shtml&quot;&gt;special telephone equipment distribution programs&lt;/a&gt; that provide telephone-compatible anti-stuttering devices free to qualified residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're employed, ask your employer to help pay for an anti-stuttering device. All of my customers who've asked their employers received help. And then they were given extra work and responsibilities. Some also got raises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your employer were to say no, you could mention that the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Americans with Disabilities Act&lt;/a&gt; requires employers to pay for &amp;quot;reasonable accommodations&amp;quot; requested by employees with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're unemployed and stutter, your state's vocational rehabilitation program will help get you a job, including paying for speech therapy and/or an anti-stuttering device. See the section &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Vocational Rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some speech clinics will handle your insurance billing for anti-stuttering devices. The CPT/HCPCS procedure code for electronic anti-stuttering devices is E1399-NU. The diagnosis code for stuttering is 307.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had good experiences with [http://www.sertoma.org/ Sertoma] and [http://www.lionsclubs.org/ Lions Clubs]. Sertoma assists persons with speech, hearing, and language disorders. Service organizations prefer to help low-income children, and they prefer to be approached by the child's speech-language pathologist.&lt;/p&gt;

==Indirect Therapy==

&lt;p&gt;Indirect therapy is a &amp;quot;gentle nudge.&amp;quot; Indirect therapy changes the &lt;i&gt;parents'&lt;/i&gt; speech and behaviors. The speech-language pathologist trains the parents to slow down and use simple vocabulary, and not criticize the child, to not put pressure on the child (e.g., don't demand that the child confess guilt), to wait two seconds after the child finishes speaking before answering the child, and to give the child lots of hugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indirect therapy is ineffective. A literature review found&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#133;little convincing evidence&amp;#133;that parents of children who stutter differ from parents of children who do not stutter in the way they talk with their children. Similarly, there is little objective support&amp;#133;that parents' speech behaviors contribute to children's stuttering or that modifying parents' speech behaviors facilitates children's fluency.{{ref|Nippold1995}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen studies found no evidence that altering parental behavior changed children's speech. These studies found no differences for positive statements (praise, encouragement, agreement), negative statements (criticism, reprimands), questions, topic initiations and terminations{{ref|Meyers1985a}}; conversational assertiveness and responsiveness{{ref|Weiss1992}}; 
response time latency or the time between one person finishing speaking, and the other person beginning speaking{{ref|Kelly1992}}; &amp;quot;formal&amp;quot; style vs. a &amp;quot;casual&amp;quot; style{{ref|Howell1997}}; or illocution.{{ref|Rommel1997}}

&lt;p&gt;The studies I really liked found the opposite of what the &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; have been telling parents for 75 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A study found that mothers interrupt their child after dysfluencies, not before.{{ref|Meyers1985b}} This suggests that &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; interrupting causes children to stutter!&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;A study found that when mothers spoke faster their children spoke &lt;i&gt;slower&lt;/i&gt;.{{ref|Meyers1985c}} Another study trained parents to slow their speaking rates. The children's speaking rate &lt;i&gt;increased&lt;/i&gt;.{{ref|Stephenson-Opsal1988}} This suggests that parents talking &lt;i&gt;slowly&lt;/i&gt; causes their children to stutter!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Parents of children who stutter produced more positive statements (e.g., praise, encouragement) and fewer negative statements (e.g. criticisms, disparaging remarks) than parents of children who didn't stutter.{{ref|Meyers1990}} This suggests that parents' praise and encouragement &lt;i&gt;causes&lt;/i&gt; children to stutter!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;A multiyear study followed 93 preschool children. At the start, none of the children stuttered. One year later, 26 of the children stuttered. The researchers compared the speech behaviors of the two groups of mothers, before their children started stuttering. No differences were found, except that mothers of children who would stutter had shorter, less complex utterances.{{ref|Kloth1995}} This contradicts the &amp;quot;capacities and demands model&amp;quot; of childhood stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, some psychologists now discount the role of parents in the development of children's character and personality. About 50% of the personality differences are attributable to our genes, and the rest due to the child's peers: &amp;quot;&amp;#133;what parents do seems to be nearly irrelevant.&amp;quot;{{ref|Harris1998}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Direct Therapy== 

&lt;p&gt;In contrast,&lt;i&gt; direct therapy&lt;/i&gt; changes the child's speech and behaviors. Direct therapy can be more of a big shove, rather than a gentle nudge. It may include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Games to encourage speaking.&lt;/li&gt;
	
	&lt;li&gt;Games to train specific speech skills, similar to adult [[Speech-Language_Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Open- and Closed-Loop Speech Motor Control| fluency shaping therapy]].&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Modeling the child's speech and/or behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A child's first therapy session may just be playing a game to encourage the child to talk. E.g., the speech-language pathologist and child silently play with separate boxes of trucks, on opposite sides of the room. The speech-language pathologist begins making engine sounds. She then gradually moves to the center of the room, and her trucks interact with the child's trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Say the Magic Word&amp;quot; is another game to encourage talking. You can play this while looking through a picture book, or while driving. The parent says she sees something. The child guesses what the parent sees. When the child says the &amp;quot;magic word,&amp;quot; the parent rings a bell or gives the child a peanut. No particular word is magic&amp;#151;the child is rewarded for fluent words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Auditory Processing/Altered Auditory Feedback#Frequency-Shifted Auditory Feedback| frequency-shifted auditory feedback]] (FAF) device makes shy children want to talk. They're fascinated to hear their voices sounding like a &amp;quot;little kid&amp;quot; (frequency upshift) or a &amp;quot;monster&amp;quot; (frequency downshift).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some games teach speech skills. In &amp;quot;Can't Catch Me,&amp;quot; one person gets a peanut when the other person asks a question. You then quietly eat your peanut before answering the question. If you answer the question before eating your peanut, you must put your peanut back. The parent should lose more peanuts than the child, by answering too quickly. This reduces the time pressure the child feels about quickly answering questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A turtle hand puppet can teach slow speech with stretched vowels. When the child uses the target speech skills, the turtle slowly walks. When the child speaks fast, the turtle retreats into her shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[http://www.superduperinc.com Super Duper]  has other games for stuttering therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

==Modeling==

&lt;blockquote&gt;Caitlyn, a four-year-old female who began to stutter in the midst of her parents' divorce, was exhibiting significant struggle and tension behavior as well as secondary behaviors. Of most concern was her head-banging behavior during difficult moments of stuttering. After many sessions in which I attempted to eliminate this behavior through fluency-shaping principles, I saw no change. One day, shortly after Caitlyn banged her forehead on the table to interrupt a block, I modeled the same behavior. Caitlyn was shocked and ignored me. After I did this several times she asked me, &amp;quot;Why did you do that? Didn't that hurt?&amp;quot; I responded, &amp;quot;I don't know why I did it. But it sure didn't help me get my word out!&amp;quot; Caitlyn never again banged her head to help her talk. She has been out of therapy for six years and remains fluent.{{ref|Wallace1998}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This speech-language pathologist's &lt;i&gt;modeling&lt;/i&gt; of Caitlyn's behavior was radically different from conventional stuttering therapy practices. The speech-language pathologist improved the child's awareness of her stuttering. In contrast, most &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; would have pretended not to notice Caitlyn's head-banging behavior. They would have predicted that making Caitlyn aware of her head-banging would have caused emotional trauma and made her stuttering worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that a teenage brother and sister use profanity at the family dinner table. Should the parents act horrified and tell their children never to use such language? Should they refuse to allow dessert or television for the teenagers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know that won't work. The teenagers will use profanity at the next opportunity, just for the amusement of horrifying their parents. Instead, the parents should immediately use twice as much profanity. Dad should say, &amp;quot;#$%^, this is best *&amp;amp;^% meatloaf in the whole @#$% world!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom should then respond, &amp;quot;Oh, you big !@#$, you're so &amp;amp;^%$ cool and #$%^ sexy and when you talk ^%$#!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teenagers will turn red with embarrassment, and never use profanity again in front of their parents!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In a psychology class about traumatized children we saw a video of a ten-year-old boy destroying a psychologist's office. The boy threw every object he could throw, and smashed everything else. The psychologist sat there calmly telling the boy not to destroy the office. He finally grabbed the boy and hugged him. To me it looked like a full body restraint but the instructor said it was a hug, and that was what the boy really needed. I asked what would have happened if the psychologist had modeled the boy's behavior. E.g., the psychologist could have thrown and smashed stuff. The instructor said that was the worst idea she'd ever heard. But I think the boy would have stopped, watched in amazement as the psychologist destroyed his own office, and then asked, &amp;quot;Why did you do that?&amp;quot; The boy and the psychologist could then have started talking, with understanding of what the boy was feeling, which is what I think the boy needed.&lt;/i&gt;--[[User:Tdkehoe|Thomas David Kehoe]] 02:06, 28 March 2006 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of modeling is to improve the subject's awareness of his or her behaviors. Stutterers are largely unaware of their stuttering, or at least what they do when they stutter. Everyone else can see the stuttering but the stutterer can't. Combining video and modeling can help a stutterer improve [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Psychological Issues/Self-Awareness of Stuttering Behaviors#Self-Awareness of Stuttering Behaviors|self-awareness]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modeling also dispels a person's mistaken view that a behavior is invisible, or it's acceptable, or everyone does it. If everyone ignores undesirable behavior then the person may think it's OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modeling only works when the modeler or the modelee knows how to replace the undesirable behavior with a target behavior. E.g., it's OK for your speech-language pathologist to model your stuttering because she can show you how to speak fluently. It was OK for [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Automatic, Effortless Fluency#My Romantic Disaster of 1996|my Romantic Disaster of 1996]] to make me aware that I was stuttering, because I knew what to do to talk fluently. It's not OK to point out a problem to someone who has no idea what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;Feedback and Biofeedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The associative stage of motor learning requires feedback. In sports this is called &lt;i&gt;knowledge of results&lt;/i&gt;. E.g., in golf or tennis you see where the ball goes after you hit it. Playing golf or tennis on a dark, foggy night would be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback quality is affected by &lt;i&gt;speed&lt;/i&gt;. If you hit ten golf balls on a dark, foggy night, then the next day find one of the balls 150 yards away, you'll have no memory of what you did right to hit it so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback quality is also affected by &lt;i&gt;accuracy&lt;/i&gt;. If you and your buddy each hit a golf ball, and one ball goes 150 yards but you don't know whose ball it was, you have inaccurate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the observer gets bored. If you hit golf balls for hours, and have a person telling you how far the balls go, sooner or later the person will stop paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Fluency Skills Feedback&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;When you're learning fluent speech motor skills, you need knowledge of results. Some skills are easy to observe the results of. E.g., resting your hand on your stomach tells you whether you're using diaphragmatic (relaxed) breathing or thoracic (speech) breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your articulators (lips, jaw, and tongue) are a little harder to be aware of, as you can't see them. But you have good proprioceptive awareness of these muscles, so developing awareness and control isn't hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your vocal folds are another story. These muscles are deep in your throat. You can't touch them or see them. Most people don't even know they have vocal folds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult feedback is with the timing of all this. E.g., your speech-language pathologist tells you to exhale a little air and then increase your vocal fold tension. You do this slowly and correctly. Then she tells you to increase the speed. You must execute these movements within hundredths of a second. You can't tell whether you're doing it right, and most speech-language pathologists can't either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fluency specialist who's helped hundreds of stutterers has better-trained ear and visual skills and gives better quality of feedback than a speech-language pathologist who's never treated a stutterer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;biofeedback&quot;&gt;Biofeedback Devices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;AuditoryProcessing.shtml#&quot;&gt;last chapter&lt;/a&gt; I discussed anti-stuttering devices that treat the auditory processing underactivity associated with stuttering. Now I'll discuss stuttering therapy devices that use biofeedback to treat the speech motor control overactivity associated with stuttering.&lt;a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn16' href=&quot;#_ftn16&quot; name=&quot;_ftnref16&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=MsoFootnoteReference&gt;&lt;span style='font-family:Symbol;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'&gt;&lt;span style='mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol'&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Biofeedback&lt;/i&gt; is the measurement and display (to the user) of a physiological activity, to enable the user to improve awareness and control of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biofeedback machines provides faster, more precise, and more reliable feedback than a human observer. Machines can provide feedback in real-time, beeping the instant you make a mistake. Machines can accurately measure things humans can't see or hear. And machines never get bored, even after hours of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But biofeedback devices aren't a &amp;quot;miracle cure&amp;quot; for stuttering. Stuttering therapy works on many motor skills, so you might need several devices. Another problem is that certain motor activities are difficult to monitor, especially the vocal folds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;CAFET and Dr. Fluency&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.afccafet.com/cafetoverview.htm&quot;&gt;Computer-Aided Fluency Establishment and Trainer&lt;/a&gt;(CAFET) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sts.co.il/DrFluency/Index.htm&quot;&gt;Dr. Fluency&lt;/a&gt; are computer-based stuttering biofeedback systems. Both use a microphone to monitor vocal volume, as a surrogate for vocal fold activity, and a chest strap to monitor breathing. Dr. Fluency uses two chest straps, to differentiate diaphragmatic (relaxed) breathing from thoracic (upper chest) breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see your breathing and your vocal volume displayed on the computer screen, along with instructions or error messages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer systems train similar speech motor skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Relaxed, diaphragmatic breathing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Continuous breathing. The computer alerts you if you hold your breath more than 1/3 of a second.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gradual exhalation, as opposed to the rapid, uncontrolled exhalation associated with stuttering.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pre-voice exhalation, or letting a little air out before you begin tensing your vocal folds.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gentle onset, or gradually increase vocal volume. The computer alerts you if your vocal volume changes too rapidly. The computer also alerts you if your voice is too quiet for your air flow (which sounds breathy).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Continuous phonation. Breaks in vocal volume are shown on the computer monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adequate breath support. The computer alerts you if you continue to talk after the point at which you should take another breath. Stutterers too often try to finish a phrase with insufficient air in their lungs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Phrasing. Each of the above seven speech targets is taught first with vowels, then progressing to monosyllabic words, then to marked-length phrases. Stutterers too often pause to breathe at feared words or when they run out of air, rather than pausing to breathe at linguistically-appropriate points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAFET and Dr. Fluency provide the following advantage over non-instrument-based stuttering therapy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The computer provides instant, accurate information on what you are doing right or wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The computers are always paying attention, and never get tired of helping you practice.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The computers provide step-by-step instructions. Dr. Fluency has animated graphics showing what your speech muscles should do for each exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;With the computer training the physical speech motor skills, the speech pathologist can spend more time on the psychological aspects of stuttering.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you learn &lt;i&gt;visually&lt;/i&gt; rather than &lt;i&gt;aurally&lt;/i&gt;, you may learn faster with the computer displays than by listening to your speech on a tape recorder.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dr. Fluency is designed for home practice use as well as clinical use. According to motor learning theory, practicing one hour per day is optimal. Practicing more hours per day or fewer days per week produces poorer results in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unpublished study of the CAFET program with 197 adults and teenagers reported that 82% met fluency criteria six months after completing the program; 89% were fluent after twelve months; and 92% were fluent two years post-therapy. These results are impressive, but unpublished studies are questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Electromyography (EMG)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EMG measures muscle activity via electrodes taped to your skin. Several &lt;a href=&quot;References.shtml#edn44&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; found EMG to be effective for treating stuttering. These include the large &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found computers to be more effective than speech-language pathologists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest fluency breakthrough was with EMG biofeedback. I brought my company's first EMG/DAF/FAF device to a speech-language pathology convention. For four days, eight hours a day, I showed hundreds of speech-language pathologists how the devices worked. I showed how tensing my vocal folds caused red lights and DAF/FAF to switch on, and relaxing my vocal folds made green lights go on and DAF/FAF to switch off. For a week after the convention I couldn't stutter. Eventually my stuttering returned, but daily use of the device on telephone calls kept my stuttering under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But EMG biofeedback isn't a &amp;quot;miracle cure.&amp;quot; Surface electrodes poorly monitor vocal fold activity (the primary symptom of stuttering), because vocal folds are deep in the neck, surrounded by other muscles. EMG devices are costly and difficult to set up. And even at the convention I heard speech-language pathologists laughing behind my back at the strange apparatus, with electrodes taped to my face and wires everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;vocalfrequency&quot;&gt;Vocal Frequency Biofeedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The great problem in stuttering therapy biofeedback is how to monitor vocal fold activity. EMG surface electrodes can't do this. The CAFET and Dr. Fluency monitor vocal fold activity indirectly via vocal volume. These devices assume is that a quiet voice means relaxed vocal folds, and loud voice means tense vocal folds. That isn't always true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better method is to monitor the frequencies of the stutterer's voice. Relaxed vocal folds generally produce a deep-pitched voice; tense vocal folds generally produce a high-pitched voice. The user simply speaks into a microphone; no electrodes are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocal frequency biofeedback is also available in Kay Elemetrics' Visi-Pitch device, and in my company's Pocket Speech Lab. I've found that no one&amp;#151;stutterers or speech-language pathologists&amp;#151;can control the red and green lights when they first try the device. But after about ten minutes of training a light bulb goes on in their heads and they can easily control their vocal fold tension and vocal pitch, and make the light turn red or green at will. This suggests to me that no stuttering therapy programs train how to relax one's vocal folds. Many stuttering therapy programs claim to do this but I don't see the results. I suspect that &amp;quot;gentle onsets&amp;quot; are not the best way to train stutterers to speak with relaxed vocal folds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Introducing yourself to an attractive person. Raising your hand to answer a teacher's question. Ordering in a restaurant. Calling a store to ask if they have what you want. Making a toast at your best friend's wedding reception. Calling to order a pizza. Leaving a voicemail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do any of these make you nervous? Any that you never, ever do? Everyone is nervous about some speaking situations. Public speaking is humanity's most common fear, greater than the fear of death. Few women will introduce themselves to a man to ask for a date, or call a man who's given his telephone number and asked for a date. Ordering in a French restaurant is scarier than ordering at McDonald's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Predator Approach&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Rent the video [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093773/ Predator], starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura. Settle down with a bowl of popcorn to watch the governor of California and the governor of Minnesota discuss school funding and property tax reform. Just joking. Back in 1987, Schwarzenegger and Ventura were action movie heroes. In &lt;i&gt;Predator&lt;/i&gt; the men shoot a variety of large weapons, including an M-134 7.62mm minigun and an M-79 grenade launcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now write down a list of speaking tasks that you don't do, that non-stutterers don't think twice about doing. Let's say that you're afraid to leave voicemails on answering machines. Write down all the speech therapy tools you can use in this situation. Imagine yourself as Schwarzenegger and Ventura making a list of weapons to bring. But instead of arming yourself with a minigun and a grenade launcher, your weapons for voicemail could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Practicing your message before you call.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fluency skills, such as slow speech with stretched vowels, relaxing your breathing, or relaxing your vocal folds.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Using a DAF/FAF anti-stuttering device.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A hierarchy of stress, beginning with calling your own answering machine, then calling your speech-language pathologist's answering machine, then calling a friend's answering machine, then calling a business's answering machine (e.g., calling restaurants before they open asking if they have banquet facilities), and finally calling that attractive person of the opposite sex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't stop listing your arsenal until you look at the list and laugh at how you'll blow away that poor little voicemail. Then think of one more weapon to add to your list. You're ready when you're confident that you won't stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say that your message is, &amp;quot;You're the most wonderful person I've ever met. I can't wait to see you again.&amp;quot; Using all of your fluency weapons, pick up the phone and call your own answering machine. Check your messages. Pretty good, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now call yourself again. This time, reduce or throw away one of your weapons. If you used one-second stretched syllables on the first call, call yourself using half-second stretch. Then go to quarter-second &amp;quot;slow normal&amp;quot; speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you used an anti-stuttering device on the first call, don't use the device for your next call. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you practiced the message on the first call, say something spontaneous on your next call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step by step, throw away your weapons, until you can call your own voicemail fluently, without effort or fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, if you're a non-violent person, think of this as a multifactoral approach to stuttering therapy. Instead of relying on one fluency skill, take one item from the [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Auditory Processing|auditory processing]] category, e.g., an anti-stuttering device; one item from the [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control|speech motor control]] category, e.g., relaxed vocal folds; one item from the stress control category, e.g., using a hierarchy of stress; one item from the [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Genes and Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitters]] category, e.g., medication, etc. Don't select all your fluency skills from one category, e.g., gentle onsets, diaphragmatic breathing, relaxed vocal folds, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Make a Stress Hierarchy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now take a step up the stress hierarchy. Call your speech-language pathologist and leave a message. (If you're not in speech therapy, call a friend or relative.) Begin with your full arsenal of fluency weapons, then call back, using fewer fluency weapons. Then work your way up your stress hierarchy. If you feel any twinge of fear on a call, take a step back until you feel confident again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaching feared speaking situations can be like fighting a grizzly bear armed only with a pocket knife. Scary speaking situations combine to look like a ten-foot-tall bear. Most speech therapy programs give you only one weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divide your general fear of speaking into specific fears. The giant bear becomes many small bears. Now create a stress hierarchy, with a small bear on one end, and a bunny rabbit on the other end. And instead of having one weapon, which your speech-language pathologist (or the expert who trained her back at the university) assured you was the One True treatment for stuttering, you now have a variety of fluency skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You're armed like Arnold Schwarzenegger, you're hunting bunny rabbits, and you're in a pet shop before Easter. Armed to the teeth with speech therapy skills, there's no possibility of stuttering in your feared situation. Heck, it isn't even a feared situation anymore!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now see why this chapter follows the [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Auditory Processing|auditory processing]] chapter and the [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control|speech motor learning and control]] chapter. The previous chapters gave you many weapons for your fluency arsenal. Now that you have many fluency skills you have no reason to fear speaking situations. Work your way down your list of feared speaking situations until you have no more speech-related fears and anxieties than an average non-stutterer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Further Reducing Fears and Anxieties&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;When you run out speech-related fears and anxieties that non-stutterers aren't scared of, make a list of speaking situations that scare non-stutterers. Remember when I said that your speech can be better than non-stutterers? When you're ready, move on to these areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Walk up to strangers at parties. If you're single, pick attractive persons of the opposite sex. Say that your speech therapist wants you to talk to strangers and ask if you can talk to this person. If you have an anti-stuttering device, ask if it's OK to use it. No one is going to say no. I met one of my ex-girlfriends this way.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Join Toastmasters International to learn public speaking skills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sign up for a beginning acting class at a university or community theater. Acting classes are the most fun you've had since sixth grade.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Put together some funny stories and sign up to do stand-up comedy on amateur night at a nightclub.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sign up for voice lessons. Amaze people by singing at social occasions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Learn a foreign language. Talk to cab drivers in their native language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stress Is the Absence of Choices&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;We experience stress when our plans are thwarted. We try to reach a goal, and some little thing stops us. For stutterers, that little thing often is an inability to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., you go to a fast-food restaurant to buy a cheeseburger. You can see the cheeseburgers behind the counter. You can smell the cheeseburgers. You even have correct change in your hand. All you have to do is say, &amp;quot;Cheeseburger&amp;quot;&amp;#151;but stuttering stops you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of thinking of stress as thwarted plans, think about your choices. You could point at the cheeseburgers. You could write &amp;quot;cheeseburger&amp;quot; on a note. You always have choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you focus only on reaching your goal, you miss opportunities that may be better than your goal. E.g., you miss the salmon pesto salad the restaurant just added to the menu. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you pantomime &amp;quot;cheeseburger&amp;quot; as if you were playing charades. You feel ridiculous, and people in the line laugh at you. Then a movie producer offers you a million dollars to star in his new &amp;quot;stupid and stupider&amp;quot; movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, that's unlikely. Just realize that you always have choices. As you imagine your choices, you'll feel your stress going away. Your insurmountable problem now looks like a variety of choices (see the section [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Response Selection Under Stress/Speech-Related Fears and Anxieties#Personal Construct Therapy: You Always Have Choices|Personal Construct Therapy]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Use a Partner to Center Your Emotions&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;When you feel stressed, find a partner who expresses the opposite emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.g., if you're fired from your job. You come home feeling like a failure and you'll never succeed. You don't want a partner who agrees with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you want a partner who'll tell you that you're smart and hardworking, and you'll soon find a better job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture your emotions like a car with a manual transmission. To shift from one gear to another gear, you have to shift through neutral gear. Similarly, to shift from feeling stressed to another emotion, first seek your emotional center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reduce Your Child's Stress&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;No studies have tested whether reducing stress affects children's stuttering. But you can try and observe whether this helps your child's speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't demand that your child confess guilt (fear of punishment). When your child experiences overwhelming emotions, e.g., is afraid to do something, don't demand that your child explain why he or she feels overwhelmed. Emotions are in a deeper, older brain area. Language is a higher, new brain function. An emotionally overwhelmed child may be unable to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't insist that your child talk in an unfamiliar situation, e.g., at a new day care center (uncertain what to say, fear of embarrassment, uncertainty of status with new children). Situations that feel comfortable to you may be stressful to your child. Try to see stress from your child's point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reduce Your Listener's Stress&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering is a rare disorder. Many people have never met a stutterer. I've had listeners ask if I was having a medical emergency, or ask if I was cold (apparently I looked like I was shivering). I have no doubt that other listeners thought that I was mentally retarded or psychotic, perhaps dangerous. Reduce their fears by saying that you stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some listeners think that they did something to make you stutter. Other listeners wish there were something they could do to help you. Tell them that you stutter. If they have any questions about stuttering, they'll ask you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Psychological Issues#Tell Stuttering Jokes|joke about stuttering]]. Or you could put stuttering on your business card, perhaps describing you as chapter leader of your local stuttering support group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better, tell listeners that you're using speech therapy skills. Ask if your fluency skills sound weird, then do what your speech-language pathologist wants you to do (e.g., breathe with your diaphragm, relax your vocal folds, slow down your speaking rate). Ask if your stuttering therapy speech sounds better than your stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask the listener to remind you when you miss a speech motor control target. You could ask listeners to remind you when you stutter, but they'll be uncomfortable doing this, and you'll feel embarrassed if you don't have good control over your stuttering. Instead, ask listeners to remind you when you miss targets, e.g., you talk too fast. You should have better control over that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're doing speech therapy, tell listeners you'll pay $1 for each missed target they point out (see my [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Automatic, Effortless Fluency#My Romantic Disaster of 1996|Romantic Disaster of 1996]]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you use an [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Auditory Processing/Altered Auditory Feedback#Altered Auditory Feedback|anti-stuttering device]], show it to your listener and ask if she minds if you use it. This is perhaps the best way to tell listeners that you stutter. Listeners invariably ask questions about the devices. In contrast, listeners rarely ask questions about speech therapy, e.g., vocal fold relaxation isn't of great interest to the general population. But everyone wants to know how anti-stuttering devices work. Suggest that the listener try on the device, and adjust it to make the listener stutter (by maximizing the delay, or moving the pitch shift up and down). When I do this, other people come over to see what's making their friend trip over his or her words. They give me positive feedback about my stuttering, laugh at their own failure to talk, and experience for a few minutes what it feels like to stutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Alternative Ways to Reduce Stress&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;If stuttering is the only way you know to reduce stress, you'll always stutter in stressful situations. Instead, learn alternative ways to reduce stress. Take a stress reduction class. Read books about handling stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to reduce stress is to relax your breathing. Stress reduction classes teach this. Or take a meditation or yoga class. Relaxed breathing not only reduces stress, it helps stutterers talk fluently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Look for Stuttering-Reducers&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a stutterer reading a projected PowerPoint presentation aloud to an audience. He scans the slides for feared words. Sure enough, there's a p-word. And an s-word! He scans the prodigious thesaurus in his brain, looking for words he can substitute. But the audience is reading the slides projected on the screen. Will they think he's illiterate if he substitutes or skips words? But what if he blocks and the audience discovers that he stutters! What can he do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's looking for stuttering-increasers. I.e., he's looking for ways to stutter. And, sure enough, stuttering-increasers&amp;#151;difficult sounds, feared words, judgmental listeners&amp;#151;abound, if you know where to find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine another stutterer, also reading aloud to an audience. Instead of looking for stuttering-increasers, she looks for stuttering-reducers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;With her text prepared for her, she can focus on using her speech therapy skills instead of thinking about what she's saying.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;She can pretend to be a robot reading machine. The robot has no emotions, it just sees words, moves its mouth, and words come out.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;She can wear an anti-stuttering device and the audience will think it's a microphone for the PA system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When she introduces herself she can say that she stutters. Audiences love presentations that start with a joke, so she could start with a joke about her stuttering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll recognize this as a variation of the [[#The Predator Approach|&lt;i&gt;Predator&lt;/i&gt; approach]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Increasing or Decreasing Stress in Therapy&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering therapy typically begins with a stutterer learning closed-loop speech motor control in a low-stress environment, e.g., chatting with the speech-language pathologist, or alone practicing word lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stutterer gradually moves from closed-loop speech motor control to open-loop speech motor control. When he achieves fluent open-loop speech motor control, the speech-language pathologist takes him to a shopping mall for &amp;quot;transfer&amp;quot; practice. Then they're finished with speech therapy and he's on his own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is fluent open-loop speech in low-stress environments, and relapse to open-loop stuttering in high-stress environments. The relapse shake the stutterer's self-confidence. Or the stress de-myelinates (weakens) fluent speech motor programs. A single high-stress, dysfluent experience might destroy weeks of low-stress practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or both. The stutterer then gets into a vicious cycle of stress and relapse leading to more stress and more relapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better plan would be to train a stutterer to recognize stressful situations, and consciously switch to closed-loop speech motor control (i.e., very [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control/Open- and Closed-Loop Speech Motor Control#Slow Speech|slow speech]]) in high-stress environments. When he feels his stress diminishing he can switch to open-loop speech motor control (i.e., normal-sounding speech). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I used to meet strangers and say, &amp;quot;My speech-language pathologist wants me to talk to strangers. May I talk to you?&amp;quot; I would then use very slow closed-loop speech motor control. After we had a friendly conversation going and my fears and anxieties diminished, I'd use the &amp;quot;slow-normal&amp;quot; speaking rate that mixes open- and closed-loop speech motor control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, with traditional therapy the stutterer switches between stuttering and fluent speech, as situations change between high-stress and low-stress. Instead, I switched between closed-loop and open-loop speech motor control, as stress changed. The result was that I constantly myelinated (strengthened) the fluent speech motor programs in my brain. Most important, I strengthened my brain's connection between stressful situations and closed-loop speech motor control. Switching to closed-loop speech motor control in a stressful situation should be as habitual as remembering to count to ten before punching someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might object that severe stutterers may be unable to produce even two-second stretch closed-loop speech motor control in stressful situations. I.e., their fluent speech completely breaks down under stress. So use the  [[#The Predator Approach|&lt;i&gt;Predator&lt;/i&gt; approach]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you might object that closed-loop speech motor control sounds &amp;quot;weird,&amp;quot; and stressful situations are where you most want to sound normal. When I said to strangers, &amp;quot;My speech-language pathologist wants me to talk to strangers&amp;#133;#133;&amp;quot; no one ever refused. Most people then asked me questions about stuttering therapy. As long as the stutterer tells listeners that he is using special &amp;quot;speech therapy speech,&amp;quot; sounding &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot; isn't an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

==The principle of relativity==

[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|right|Galileo Galilei]]Principles of relativity address the relationship between observations made at different places. This problem has been a difficult theoretical challenge since the earliest times and involves physical questions such as how the velocities of objects can be combined and how influences are transmitted between moving objects.  

One of the most fruitful approaches to this problem was the investigation of how observations are affected by the velocity of the observer.  This problem had been tackled by classical philosophers but it was the work of Galileo that produced a real breakthrough. [[w:Galileo|Galileo]] (1632), in his &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot;, considered observations of motion made by people inside a ship who could not see the outside:

:&quot;have the ship proceed with any speed you like, so long as the motion is uniform and not fluctuating this way and that. You will discover not the least change in all the effects named, nor could you tell from any of them whether the ship was moving or standing still. &quot;

According to Galileo, if the ship moved smoothly then someone inside it would be unable to determine whether they were moving.  If people in Galileo's moving ship were eating dinner they would see their peas fall from their fork straight down to their plate in the same way as they might if they were at home on dry land. The peas move along with the people and do not appear to the diners to fall diagonally.  This means that the peas continue in a state of uniform motion unless someone intercepts them or otherwise acts on them. It also means that simple experiments that the people on the ship might perform would give the same results on the ship or at home.  This concept led to “Galilean Relativity” in which it was held that things continue in a state of motion unless acted upon and that the laws of physics are independent of the velocity of the laboratory.

This simple idea challenged the previous ideas of Aristotle. [[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]] had argued in his ''Physics'' that objects must either be moved or be at rest.  According to Aristotle, on the basis of complex and interesting arguments about the possibility of a 'void', objects cannot remain in a state of motion without something moving them. As a result Aristotle proposed that objects would stop entirely in empty space. If Aristotle were right the peas that you dropped whilst dining aboard a moving ship would fall in your lap rather than falling straight down on to your plate. Aristotle's idea had been believed by everyone so Galileo's new proposal was extraordinary and, because it was nearly right, became the foundation of physics. 

Galilean Relativity contains two important principles: firstly it is impossible to determine who is actually at rest and secondly things continue in uniform motion unless acted upon.  The second principle is known as Galileo’s Law of Inertia or Newton's First Law of Motion.

===Special relativity===
Until the nineteenth century it appeared that Galilean relativity treated all observers as equivalent no matter how fast they were moving.  If you throw a ball straight up in the air at the North Pole it falls straight back down again and this also happens at the equator even though the equator is moving at almost a thousand miles an hour faster than the pole.  Galilean velocities are additive so that the ball continues moving at a thousand miles an hour when it is thrown upwards at the equator and continues with this motion until it is acted on by an external agency.
 
This simple scheme became questioned in 1865 when James Clerk Maxwell discovered the equations that describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves such as light. His equations showed that the speed of light depended upon constants that were thought to be simple properties of a physical medium or “aether” that pervaded all space.  If this were the case then, according to Galilean relativity, it should be possible to add your own velocity to the velocity of incoming light so that if you were travelling at a half the speed of light then any light approaching you would be observed to be travelling at 1.5 times the speed of light in the aether.  Similarly, any light approaching you from behind would strike you at 0.5 times the speed of light in the aether.  Light itself would always go at the same speed in the aether so if you shone a light from a torch whilst travelling at high speed the light would plop into the aether and slow right down to its normal speed.  This would spoil Galileo's Relativity because all you would need to do to discover whether you were in a moving ship or on dry land would be to measure the speed of light in different directions.  The light would go slower in your direction of travel through the aether and faster in the opposite direction.

If the Maxwell equations are valid and the simple classical addition of velocities applies then there should be a '''preferred reference frame''', the frame of the stationary aether. The preferred reference frame would be considered the true zero point to which all velocity measurements could be referred.  
 
Special relativity restored a principle of relativity in physics by maintaining that Maxwell's equations are correct but that classical velocity addition is wrong: there is no preferred reference frame.  Special relativity brought back the interpretation that in all inertial reference frames the same physics is going on and there is no phenomenon that would allow an observer to pinpoint a zero point of velocity. [[:Wikipedia:Albert Einstein|Einstein]] preserved the principle of relativity by proposing that the laws of physics are the same regardless of the velocity of the observer. According to Einstein, whether you are in the hold of Galileo's ship or in the cargo bay of a space ship going at a large fraction of the speed of light the laws of physics will be the same.

Einstein's idea shared the same philosophy as Galileo's idea, both men believed that the laws of physics would be unaffected by motion at a constant velocity.   In the years between Galileo and Einstein it was believed that it was the way velocities simply add to each other that preserved the laws of physics but Einstein adapted this simple concept to allow for Maxwell's equations.

===Frames of reference, events and transformations ===

Before proceeding further with the analysis of relative motion the concepts of reference frames, events and transformations need to be defined more closely. 

Physical observers are considered to be surrounded by a '''reference frame''' which is a set of coordinate axes in terms of which position or movement may be specified or with reference to which physical laws may be mathematically stated.  

An '''event''' is something that happens independently of the reference frame that might be used to describe it.  Turning on a light or the collision of two objects would constitute an event.

Suppose there is a small event, such as a light being turned on, that is at coordinates &lt;math&gt;x,y,z,t&lt;/math&gt; in one reference frame.  What coordinates would another observer, in another reference frame moving relative to the first at velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis assign to the event? This problem is illustrated below:

[[Image:relstandard.gif]]

What we are seeking is the relationship between the second observer's coordinates for the event &lt;math&gt;x^', y^', z^', t^'&lt;/math&gt; and the first observer's coordinates for the event &lt;math&gt;x,y,z,t&lt;/math&gt;. The coordinates refer to the positions and timings of the event that are measured by each observer and, for simplicity, the observers are arranged so that they are coincident at t=0. According to Galilean Relativity:

&lt;math&gt;x^' = x - vt&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y^' = y &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;z^' = z &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;t^' = t &lt;/math&gt;

This set of equations is known as a '''Galilean coordinate transformation''' or '''Galilean transformation'''.

These equations show how the position of an event in one reference frame is related to the position of an event in another reference frame.  But what happens if the event is something that is moving?  How do velocities transform from one frame to another?

The calculation of velocities depends on Newton's formula: &lt;math&gt;v = dx/dt&lt;/math&gt;.  The use of Newtonian physics to calculate velocities and other physical variables has led to Galilean Relativity being called '''Newtonian Relativity''' in the case where conclusions are drawn beyond simple changes in coordinates.  The velocity transformations for the velocities in the three directions in space are, according to Galilean relativity:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u^'_x = u_x - v}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u^'_y = u_y}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u^'_z = u_z}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u^'_x, u^'_y, u^'_z}&lt;/math&gt; are the velocities of a moving object in the three directions in space recorded by the second observer and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u_x, u_y, u_z}&lt;/math&gt; are the velocities recorded by the first observer and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the relative velocity of the observers. The minus sign in front of the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; means the moving object is moving away from both observers.

This result is known as the '''classical velocity addition theorem''' and summarises the transformation of velocities between two Galilean frames of reference.  It means that the velocities of projectiles must be determined relative to the velocity of the source and destination of the projectile.  For example, if a sailor throws a stone at 10 km/hr from Galileo's ship which is moving towards shore at 5 km/hr then the stone will be moving at 15 km/hr when it hits the shore.

In Newtonian Relativity the geometry of space is assumed to be Euclidean and the measurement of time is assumed to be the same for all observers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The derivation of the classical velocity addition theorem is as follows
If the Galilean transformations are differentiated with respect to time:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x^' = x - vt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dx^'/dt = dx/dt - v&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But in Galilean relativity &lt;math&gt;t^' = t&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;dx^'/dt^' = dx^'/dt&lt;/math&gt; therefore:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dx^'/dt^' = dx/dt - v&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dy^'/dt^' = dy/dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dz^'/dt^' = dz/dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If we write &lt;math&gt;u^'_x = dx^'/dt^'&lt;/math&gt; etc. then:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u^'_x = u_x - v&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u^'_y = u_y &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;u^'_z = u_z &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The postulates of special relativity===

In the previous section transformations from one frame of reference to another were described using the simple addition of velocities that were introduced in Galileo's time and these transformations are consistent with Galileo's main postulate which was that the laws of physics would be the same for all inertial observers so that no-one could tell who was at rest.  Aether theories had threatened Galileo's postulate because the aether would be at rest and observers could determine that they were at rest simply by measuring the speed of light in the direction of motion. Einstein preserved Galileo's fundamental postulate that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference but to do so he had to introduce a new postulate that the speed of light would be the same for all observers.  These postulates are listed below:

1. First postulate: the principle of relativity

Formally: '''the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference'''. 

Informally: every physical theory should look the same mathematically to every inertial observer.  Experiments in a physics laboratory in a spaceship or planet orbiting the sun and galaxy will give the same results no matter how fast the laboratory is moving.

2. Second postulate: the invariance of the speed of light

Formally: '''the speed of light in free space is a constant in all inertial frames of reference.''' 

Informally: the speed of light in a vacuum, commonly denoted c, is the same for all inertial observers, is the same in all directions, and does not depend on the velocity of the object emitting the light. 

Using these postulates Einstein was able to calculate how the observation of events depends upon the relative velocity of observers. He was then able to construct a theory of physics that led to predictions such as the equivalence of mass and energy and early quantum theory. 

Einstein's formulation of the axioms of relativity is known as the '''electrodynamic approach''' to relativity.  It has been superseded in most advanced textbooks by the “space-time approach” in which the laws of physics themselves are due to  symmetries in space-time and the constancy of the speed of light is a natural consequence of the existence of space-time. However, Einstein's approach is equally valid and represents a tour de force of deductive reasoning which provided the insights required for the modern treatment of the subject.

===Einstein's Relativity - the electrodynamic approach===

Einstein asked how the lengths and times that are measured by the observers might need to vary if both observers found that the speed of light was constant.  He looked at the formulae for the velocity of light that would be used by the two observers, &lt;math&gt;(x = ct)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x^' = ct^')&lt;/math&gt;,  and asked what constants would need to be introduced to keep the measurement of the speed of light at the same value even though the relative motion of the observers meant that the &lt;math&gt;x^'&lt;/math&gt; axis was continually advancing.  His working is shown in detail in the [[Special_Relativity/Mathematical_Appendix#Mathematics_of_the_Lorentz_Transformation_Equations | appendix]].  The result of this calculation is the '''Lorentz Transformation Equations''':

:&lt;math&gt;x' = \gamma (x - vt)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma (t - \frac{v x}{c^{2}})\, &lt;/math&gt;

Where the constant &lt;math&gt; \gamma = \frac {1}{\sqrt {1 -\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;. These equations apply to any two observers in relative motion but note that the sign within the brackets changes according to the direction of the velocity - see the [[Special_Relativity/Mathematical_Appendix#Mathematics_of_the_Lorentz_Transformation_Equations | appendix]].

'''The Lorentz Transformation''' is the equivalent of the Galilean Transformation with the added assumption that everyone measures the same velocity for the speed of light no matter how fast they are travelling.  The speed of light is a ratio of distance to time (ie: metres per second) so for everyone to measure the same value for the speed of light the length of measuring rods, the length of space between light sources and receivers and the number of ticks of clocks must dynamically differ between the observers.  So long as lengths and time intervals vary with the relative velocity of two observers (v) as described by the Lorentz Transformation the observers can both calculate the speed of light as the ratio of the distance travelled by a light ray divided by the time taken to travel this distance and get the same value.

Einstein's approach is &quot;electrodynamic&quot; because it assumes, on the basis of Maxwell's equations, that light travels at a constant velocity. As mentioned above, the idea of a universal constant velocity is strange because velocity is a ratio of distance to time. Do the Lorentz Transformation Equations hide a deeper truth about space and time? Einstein himself (Einstein 1920) gives one of the clearest descriptions of how the Lorentz Transformation equations are actually describing properties of space and time itself.  His general reasoning is given below. 

If the equations are combined they satisfy the relation:

(1) &lt;math&gt;x^{'2} - c^2t^{'2} = x^2 - c^2t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Einstein (1920) describes how this can be extended to describe movement in any direction in space:

(2) &lt;math&gt;x^{'2} + y^{'2} + z^{'2} - c^2t^{'2} = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - c^2t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Equation (2) is a '''geometrical postulate''' about the relationship between lengths and times in the universe.  It suggests that there is a constant s such that:

:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^{'2} + y^{'2} + z^{'2} - c^2t^{'2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - c^2t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation was recognised by Minkowski as an extension of Pythagoras' Theorem (ie: &lt;math&gt;s^2 = x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;), such extensions being well known in early twentieth century mathematics.  What the Lorentz Transformation is telling us is that the universe is a four dimensional spacetime and as a result there is no need for any &quot;aether&quot;. (See Einstein 1920, appendices, for Einstein's discussion of how the Lorentz Transformation suggests a four dimensional universe but be cautioned that &quot;imaginary time&quot; has now been replaced by the use of &quot;metric tensors&quot;).

Einstein's analysis shows that the x-axis and time axis of two observers in relative motion do not overlie each other,  The equation relating one observer's time to the other observer's time shows that this relationship changes with distance along the x-axis ie: 

:&lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma (t - \frac{v x}{c^{2}})\, &lt;/math&gt;

This means that the whole idea of &quot;frames of reference&quot; needs to be re-visited to allow for the way that axes no longer overlie each other.

==Inertial reference frames==

The Lorentz Transformation for time involves a component &lt;math&gt;(vx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt; which results in time measurements being different along the x-axis of relatively moving observers.  This means that the old idea of a frame of reference that simply involves three space dimensions with a time that is in common between all of the observers no longer applies.  To compare measurements between observers the concept of a &quot;reference frame&quot; must be extended to include the observer's clocks.

An '''inertial reference frame''' is a conceptual, three-dimensional latticework of measuring rods set at right angles to each other with clocks at every point that are synchronised with each other (see below for a full definition). An object that is part of, or attached to, an inertial frame of reference is defined as an object which does not disturb the synchronisation of the clocks and remains at a constant spatial position within the reference frame.  The inertial frame of reference that has a moving, non-rotating body attached to it is known as the '''inertial rest frame''' for that body. An inertial reference frame that is a rest frame for a particular body moves with the body when observed by observers in relative motion. 

[[file:Inertial.svg|880px]] 

This type of reference frame became known as an &quot;inertial&quot; frame of reference because, as will be seen later in this book, each system of objects that are co-moving according to Newton's law of inertia (without rotation, gravitational fields or forces acting) have a common rest frame, with clocks that differ in synchronisation and rods that differ in length, from those in other, relatively moving, rest frames.

There are many other definitions of an &quot;inertial reference frame&quot; but most of these, such as &quot;an inertial reference frame is a reference frame in which Newton's First Law is valid&quot; do not provide essential details about how the coordinates are arranged and/or represent deductions from more fundamental definitions.

The following definition by Blandford and Thorne(2004) is a fairly complete summary of what working physicists mean by an inertial frame of reference:

&quot;An inertial reference frame is a (conceptual) three-dimensional latticework of measuring rods and clocks with the following properties: (i ) The latticework moves freely through spacetime (i.e., no forces act on it), and is attached to gyroscopes so it does not rotate with respect to distant, celestial objects. (ii ) The measuring rods form an orthogonal lattice and the length intervals marked on them are uniform when compared to, e.g., the wavelength of light emitted by some standard type of atom or molecule; and therefore the rods form an orthonormal, Cartesian coordinate system with the coordinate x measured along one axis, y along another, and z along the third. (iii ) The clocks are densely packed throughout the latticework so that, ideally, there is a separate clock at every lattice point. (iv ) The clocks tick uniformly when compared, e.g., to the period of the light emitted by some standard type of atom or molecule; i.e., they are ideal clocks. (v) The clocks are synchronized by the Einstein synchronization process: If a pulse of light, emitted by one of the clocks, bounces off a mirror attached to another and then returns, the time of bounce &lt;math&gt;t_b&lt;/math&gt; as measured by the clock that does the bouncing is the average of the times of emission and reception as
measured by the emitting and receiving clock: &lt;math&gt;t_b=1/2(t_e + t_r)&lt;/math&gt;.¹

¹For a deeper discussion of the nature of ideal clocks and ideal measuring rods see, e.g., pp. 23-29 and 395-399 of Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973).&quot;

Special Relativity demonstrates that the inertial rest frames of objects that are moving relative to each other do not overlay one another. Each observer sees the other, moving observer's, inertial frame of reference as distorted. This discovery is the essence of Special Relativity and means that the transformation of coordinates and other measurements between moving observers is complicated. It will be discussed in depth below.

Firefox
By: Shawn Wilkinson

Introduction
Firefox is a piece of software the allows you to surf the web.  This piece of software and others like it are known as web browsers, or more common browsers, because they say what they do. They browse the web. Firefox is in my opinion and many others the best browser. It has tabbed browsing, a password saver, search engine search, and many other features build in (these feature will be explained later). Firefox is also very secure, which is an important feature because of the many people out there that can take your information. In this tutorial you will learn how to use how to use firefox to the best of its capabilities. If you are a beginner or as, in the internet world a noob, you will learn a lot from this tutorial, or if you are a very skilled in computers you can learn tips and tricks on this browser (h4xx0r).

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis.

''(feel free to add any content you find to these lists)''

== Policy ==

[[Artificial Intelligence/How you can help]] is our [[WB:LMOS]].

== Layout ==

AI is a rather large field (especially considering its age) so dividing it into small easily digestible chapters takes some effort. The basic idea, I think, should not be to create a book that needs to be read from start to finish. If this book is ever going to be used in the classroom (or other learning environments) people will need to be able to pick and choose according to their interests or curriculum. Chapters should therefore be as much standalone as possible, and required knowledge should be described clearly (both in terms of previous chapters and other knowledge (such as a basic grasp of programming structures or familiarity with Linear Mathematics). 

I think the basics of AI can be divided into around seven areas (like logic, machine learning, language etc.) To allow us to go into the more complicated areas as well (such as reinforcement learning or advanced neural models), I propose to set up a 'tiered' system. 

The first section would describe basic techniques and knowledge (such as logic and state space search ), that can be read in any order and serve as required knowledge for the rest of the book. This section should have some simple examples of how to use the techniques for AI (to make it a little less dry), but it should basically serve to explain just the techniques. 

Section two would describe the various subfields of Artificial Intelligence, based on the content of the first section (how predicate logic is used natural language processing and knowledge engineering, how state space searches are used in  gameplay and nlp etc.) The reader is assumed to be familiar with the stuff from the first section.

Section three would expand on section two, to expand on certain narrow fields, like Neural Networks. The Machine Learning chapter from section two would touch on Neural Networks, but the chapter in section three would be an extensive description of all techniques

Section four would serve to describe the very latest techniques, that borrow from different fields of AI, or very specific subjects that have developed their own body of knowledge and techniques (such as  Machine Vision).

(Note that the word chapter in this regard is rather arbitrary. Each of these chapters could (and hopefully will) grow to the size of a book in it's own right and will certainly need to be subdivided itself)

An (incomplete) example layout would be:
*Introduction: An overview and an explanation of the field, to let the reader know what she's getting into. Includes some philosophy, history and future.

'''Section 1'''
*Logic: Describing the basics of proposition logic and predicate logic. 
*Search: Decribing the basic idea of state space searches and search algorithms.

'''Section 2'''
*Planning, Decision making and Problem Solving: From the towers of Hanoi puzzle to a (simplified) autonomous shopping agent.
*Uncertainty: Introduction to reasoning, planning and decision making with uncertainty.
*Machine Learning: The basic ideas and algorithms.
*Natural Language: Stuff like Markov models and CFG's.
*Knowledge engineering: Ways to describe and store complicated knowledge. Databases, OO concepts, knowledge bases, etc.

'''Section 3'''
*Neural Networks and related models
*Bayesian Networks
*Inference in Logic: Backward and Forward chaining, Resolution and Logic Programming.

'''Section 4'''
*Machine Vision
*Speech Recognition, Text to Speech and OCR
*Advanced Logics
*Advanced NLP and NLG techniques: A description of the various techniques for dealing with tenses, sentence focus, presuppositions, etc.
*Reinforcement Learning
*Robotics''

Please commment and criticize freely. No layout will be perfect and this is certainly not the only possibility. [[User:Risk|risk]] 17:00, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

:I really think that the first section should include the basics of probability theory and inference (of which logic is a special case) estimation and optimisation (with state space search being a special case). To section 3 I'd add  ''Probabilistic Inference: The junction tree algorithm''. In section 4, reinforcemnet learning is more a basic research field than an application field, so it should have its own section - perhaps a chapter on sequential decision making would it fit it very well, together with planning.[[User:Olethros|Olethros]]


=== Subjects ===

I think it would be good to simply think of any subject that would fall into the field of AI, anything from ''Logic'' to ''Neural Networks in Reinforcement Learning''. Just write down anything you can think of. It will give us an idea of what we're dealing with here and for anything that doesn't fit into the layout, we'll have to find a solution.

:: Many thanks for the input. Don't be so sure you can't help. I'm not saying it wouldn't be nice to have some experts contributing, but I always figure that the people that are actually learning from a wiki can help it the most. They're the readers that know how things should be explained. [[User:Risk|risk]] 00:19, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

=== Layout Themes ===

With so much added to that last list, I think we need to rethink the layouts from scratch again, so here are some of my ideas.

==== How to do xxxx with AI ====

For example, chapter one would be &quot;How to make a perfect Tic-tac-toe AI&quot;, chapter two would be &quot;How to make a strong chess AI&quot;. Maybe they can be organized in themes like this:

* Trees
** List of requirements to understand section, with references to other wikibooks. Ex. This chapter would list &quot;understands basic binary trees and searching techniques, such as depth-first and breadth first&quot;.
** How to make a perfect Tic-tac-toe AI
*** Add other ways to make tic-tac-toe AIs, neural networks, genetic algorithms, whatever.
** How to make a strong chess AI
*** Ditto.
* Learning / pattern matching
** List of requirements
** How to make a program predict where you hid the ball. (basic game, 2 &quot;cups&quot; on the screen, user clicks one, an AI predicts where you would place it in advance.)
*** Other methods to complete this.
** etc. etc.

The emphasis on this kind of book would be practicality, every AI technique would have a use. Advantages would be that students could skip around to whatever section they wanted, and editors/teachers can work on any section they want. It would be easy to split the work, and easy for someone to split their learning path to whatever they want. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:12, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

: I like the idea, but I don't think it's going to work for the whole book. So many subjects (especially the basics) can be explained best 'bottom up', explaining the ideas and methods behind it, before starting to explain their uses. Take, for example, predicate logic. It's used pretty much everywhere in AI and should be one of the first chapters in any AI book, but I'd have a hard time thinking of a simple application that shows it's power. My main AI textbook tries to explain the uses of predicate logic (in planning systems) by trying to solve/play a simple game with it. Unfortunately, the  game can be solved quite easily with some common sense programming, where predicate logic pretty much fails miserably, leaving the reader to wonder exactly what the point of the chapter (and predicate logic) was. Of course if you simply explain predicate logic bottom up and let the reader get a feel for it, the reader will see for herself what the advantages and disadvatages of predicate logic are (and begin to understand its importance). There are many AI techniques that, though useful, don't have a very specific use that explains why they're useful. Once you understand them it's easy to see why it's very helpful to understand them, but it's actually quite difficult to give a simple example of what you can do with them. 

: I can see where you're coming from, of course. Learning endless logic systems and dull algorithms without anybody explaining (or showing) what they're for an how powerful they can be, will deter even the most motivated student. So I think it'll be very important to keep the students aware of what they can achieve with the stuff they're learning (where possible), using (real world) examples and simple assignments. I also think we can use the 'how to do xxxx with AI' in the setting of a (more or less) conventional textbook. If we create regular chapters that follow a bottom up approach, but make them as modular as possible (if at all possible you should be able to read them on their own, if there's other required knowledge, it should be described at the start of the chapter), we could turn the 'how to do xxxx with AI' into special case study chapters, to tie some of the other chapters together. For instance, a case study on a strong poker AI could refer back use the gameplay chapter, the reasoning with uncertainty chapter as well as chapters on statistics and reinforcement learning. A case study of diagnosis systems could use the chapter on predicate logic, knowledge engineering and perhaps uncertainty. That way, teachers could simply follow the course of the main chapters, to make sure their students get a comprehensive overview of the field, and people learning stuff by themselves, start with a case study, and read up on the required knowledge for as far as they care to. The main function for these chapters would be to make the material come alive, so interesting and exciting subjects should be chosen (so much for the diagnosis system :). I'll try to think up some of the more juicy AI systems (at least int my opinion), and add them to the list. [[User:Risk|risk]] 02:37, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

:: We would need a variety of games too. Poker is a popular game, but not one that I'm very much interested in. (by all means though, put it in the book. The popularity of poker today is massive). Perhaps we should make a list of games that an AI should be able to solve? --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:47, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

::: Dragontamer, bear in mind that in AI the possible problems are infinite, but there is a set of tools being used over and over to solve them, whether it is &quot;How to make a strong chess AI&quot; or &quot;How to control a nuclear power plant&quot;. If you can solve the poker problem you can pretty much use the same technique to solve the chess problem. When new techniques are derived (e.g. swarm intelligence) it can be applied to almost all problems, but with various levels of success. It is much more efficient to just add a chapter covering a new technique, rather than revisiting and editing all the problems discussed. It is your job as AI expert to find the technique best suited for the problem at hand. You might not know them all, but the techniqes are categorised, and you should know where to start looking. 

:::However, similar problems tend to favour certain types of techniques e.g. for discrete n-person games, geometrical object recognition, robotic motion control etc, so you can focus on a class of problems and the category of techniques most likely to hold the optimal solution, but sometimes a better/simpler solution can be found somewhere else quite unexpectedly. I addition most real life problems implement combinations and hybrids of techniques, making the possible solutions endless. --[[User:Moxon|Moxon]] 18:35, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

Hi, I have started a wikibook on [[Knowledge Engineering for Historians]] and would like to keep in touch with you guys because that may or may not cut down on the explaining of knowledge engineering that I have to do. Also, you might want to cross link at appropriate points to my stuff. Coverage is going to be driven by what I currently work on, but if you need a specific knowledge engineering examples at any point, let me know and maybe we can help each other out. 
Thanx and good luck,
--[[User:Rck|rck]] 17:05, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

==== Lesson -- Lesson -- Application layout ====
With that done, here is another Layout Idea. Simple really.

* Lesson
* Lesson
* Chapter dedicated to application
* Lesson
* Lesson
* Chapter on applications (can be on first 2 lessons as well)

Basically, modified version of the &quot;how to do this&quot; layout, with some more space for theory. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:54, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
: Yep, that's exactly what I was thinking (fast response, btw). I forgot to mention that these case studies would of course be a far cry from the paragraph of light reading you get in a lot of textbooks (especially math) where they show very quickly how the material is used in real life, to make it a little less dry. I would like these chapters to be comprehensive studies of the subject. For instance, the chapter on chess AI's should pretty allow the reader to build a chess AI herself (which may actually be a project). [[User:Risk|risk]] 03:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

==== Giant program layout ====

I'm not sure if this could work out in AI, but it was done very well in Ivor Horton's &quot;Beginning Java 2&quot;. What he did was create a problem at the beginning of the book, and then chapter by chapter after about chapter 10, he would start building a program to solve this problem. Beginning Java Objects also did this with a different problem and solution.

Layout:
* Introduction and theory (5-10 chapters or so for intro...)
* State a problem (For Beginning Java 2, it was &quot;build a paint clone&quot;)
* Chapter Lesson
* Application to the problem
* Lesson
* Application to the problem
* Lesson
* etc. etc.

--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:54, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

:Well, in a way this is what AI is. We've got a problem (we want artificial intelligence) and every chapter should get us a little closer to the solution. On a more preactical note, I think this approach might work well for some subjects and not so well for others. We could take a single problem (like a poker AI), and go at it from different angles, but if we do that in the theory chapters we'll lose modularity (you would have to read how the logic chapter dealt with the problem to understand what the machine learning chapter was referring to), we'd pretty much be forcing people to read the chapters in a certain order. The case study chapters are actually a great solution to this; show the reader different approaches to a problem after she's read the chapters. However, since our chapters are going to be pretty big (at least in ambition, any chapter covering all its subject matter would be a small book in its own right), this approach might work for certain single chapters. Take one simple problem and keep using it to explain the subject matter of the subchapters. Since the subchapters won't have to be as modular, the approach would work better on this level. I think would have to be decided chapter by chapter, but it's definitely something to keep in mind. [[User:Risk|risk]] 03:18, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

==== Add your theme here ====
Just a stub, so anyone else with an idea, just tack it on like this message.

; Artificial Life: I think this would make a great 'case study'. It's always been one of the most exciting AI subjects to me, but in three years of studying AI, it's only come up once, as a novelty. It's not something that's taken very seriously in academic circles, but I think it's one of the subjects that really illustrates how cool AI can be (and it's visual too). It draws mainly on machine learning techniques, with perhaps some reinforcement learning. [[User:Risk|risk]]
; Data Mining: Doing some basic data mining on a large (real life) data set. I actually did this on a project, and it taught me a lot about how machine learning works in practical situations. We could actually provide a dataset (maybe something from the wikipedia servers) and show how to answer questions about it, using neural networks, decision trees, stuff like that. Everything from cleaning the data, running algorithms (Weka [http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/] would probably be good for this), and interpreting the results. [[User:Risk|risk]]
; Dialogue Systems: How to beat the turing test. :) In the end, this is still the holy grail of AI's. It would be nice study cbr systems like ALICE that are pretty much the closest we've come so far and what techniques might actually pass the test. Stuff like systems that translate everything into some expanded logic (and back) and other solutions that AI researchers like to fantasize about. [[User:Risk|risk]]

==Statisics==

Something on statistics should be placed in here. I've played &quot;robocode&quot; before, and neural networks, pattern matching, and so forth were all beaten by a simple statistical analysis of the enemy. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 15:51, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

Neural networks and pattern matching are, or should be, applied statistics. I think that the first chapter should be a background chapter, talking about: logic, search, optimisation, probability theory and inference. These are enough for describing any field of AI I think. --[[User:Olethros|Olethros]] 12:09, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

== Categorization ==
Good luck with your initiative Risk, I hope you can manage to create a feasible structure and merge the sources. On the [[w:Artificial_intelligence]] talk page there is a discussion on categorization and refactoring of the wikipedia page. The notion of categorizing according to applications rather than techniques is discussed. It might be worth while to read those ideas. Either way I think this task is next to impossible. 

Sectioning as described in the schools of thought section, in the wikipedia pages, is becoming all the more difficult with so many hybrid systems developed. Another problem is the definition of terminology such as machine learning (any adaptive system can technically be considered as part of ML), and reinforcement learning (any AI technique can be applied to achieve this). Note that the [http://www.ieee-cis.org/ IEEE Computational Intelligence Society] divides the subject under Neural networks, Fuzzy systems &amp; Evolutionary computation.

In addition to pseudo code I think browser ready scripts would also be cool. A philosophical section would also be nice. And how about a sections with new ideas and news? 

I will also add some subjects to the uncategorised list above. Dragontamer please forgive me for chopping your message. Risk, maybe you should move it to the module page – maybe some index structure could self-emerge from this :-) If I went into to much detail, forgive me and remove it. (I can get a bit carried away since I've recently written up a literature study on the subject) --[[User:Moxon|Moxon]] 21:13, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

:Wow, great stuff, thanks. I'll try to fit all these subjects into the current layout to see how it holds up. I'll no doubt have to shift things about a bit. Of course, there's quite a difference between the perfect categorization of AI subjects and the perfect way to set up an AI textbook (although I don't think either goal is completely attainable). For instance, Machine Learning might be a very inefficient category, (since so many systems fall under it) but it's a chapter that (imo) no AI textbook should be without (because it shows very important techniques and design philosophies). Still, it's good to have a thought out list like this to see that all subjects will fit into the layout. 

:I like the other ideas too. A section for recent AI ideas and activity is a great idea (to give the reader an idea of where the action is). Most of my AI textbooks are only five years old and starting to get out of date already. Browsers script and applets would be a cool extra, but I'm not sure if wikimedia would allow that kind of code. I suppose we'll figure something out when (and if) we reach that point. [[User:Risk|risk]] 00:00, 31 December 2005 (UTC)

== Categorization 2 ==

I've started compiling all the ideas from this page into a layout on the article page. I haven't incorporated everything yet, (all the topics under subjects need to be checked to see if they can (or need to) be incorporated). Discuss it here. [[User:Risk|risk]] 14:55, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

== Outlining AI ==

I am sorry to add to the mess here. I do not agree with the current direction. Headings like &quot;Section 2: Basic AI topics&quot; and &quot;Section 3: More advanced topics and techniques&quot; add to the confusion, albeit I appreciate the efforts that has been done.[[User:Connection|Connection]] 13:54, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

We should set &quot;Applications of AI&quot; and &quot;Application Areas&quot; apart. For example Robotics is an Application Area where AI is used. Expert Systems (the topic) is an Application of AI, where AI tools are used. Neural Networks are an Application of AI.[[User:Connection|Connection]] 13:54, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

Areas of Application where a body of knowledge has been developed separate of the area itself (like Computational Linguistics in NLP) has its specific Constructs. They need a special term. For example, &quot;Application Constructs&quot; may be used, pending a better name. This heading covers &quot;Stuff like Markov models, POS taggers and CFG's&quot;, Semantic Nets, ... [[User:Connection|Connection]] 13:54, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

AI Application Constructs are in turn served by AI Constructs (again, pending a better name). These are Predicate Logic, Heuristic Modeling, ... [[User:Connection|Connection]] 13:54, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

Finally, &quot;AI Tools&quot; are formal systems used to implement and to assist in devlepoment AI Applications. This should cover Programming Languages (Lisp, Prolog), OO Implementations, ... This Book Section covers Techniques and &quot;How to&quot;, and provides Program source code.[[User:Connection|Connection]] 13:54, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

This Layered Approach leads to the following Outline (currently at First Level): [[User:Connection|Connection]] 13:54, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

*Overview

*Background (introduces concepts needed to understand Constructs: Probability, ...)

*Constructs

*Application Constructs

*Applications of AI

*Application Areas

*AI Tools

== I can't understand this ==

I don't get what this book is about, reading above it seems like you people are going through every step to create an AI individually however since nobody created a really good AI, i.e. human intelligence, you can't give a step by step instruction since there are many completely different ways that head in different directions that didn't produce any better results than the other, e.g. artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, heuristic probability search, etc. I hope you understand my concerns. [[User:80.109.79.136|80.109.79.136]] 13:19, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

:(Apologies for the necropost, but it's not very active around here.) I'm not quite sure where you get that impression apart from the one suggestion above (&quot;Giant program layout&quot;), which was shot down for the same reasons you gave. This book would be a broad introduction to AI concepts. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 01:31, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

== Prerequisite: Discrete mathematics ==

I added the ''[[Discrete mathematics]]'' prerequisite because I'd expect it to cover the &quot;review&quot; aspects of the first section as it's currently listed (propositional logic, searching, probability). (Examples: [http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072880082/information_center_view0/table_of_contents.html (Chapters 1, 6, 10)], [http://www.pearsonhighered.com/academic/product/0,3110,0130652474,00.html (Ch. 2, 7, 9)].) We might want to point people specifically to ''[[Formal Logic]]'' for first-order logic. This would help trim the scope of this book to its specific topic. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 04:18, 5 January 2009 (UTC)

== Outline 1 ==

Let me repost the only outline that has so far been presented, from the above section &quot;Subjects&quot;. Posting further outlines, as extensive as this one, is a way to make sure all the content is convered and well organized. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 14:22, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

[[Wikipedia:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]] started as a project at a university, the Stanford University Network. Its acronym, SUN, became representative of a company that provided computer hardware and software, especially for servers. {{ref|sun}}

Sun also invented the [[Wikipedia:Java programming language|Java programming language]]. The Java technology attracted much interest from the community of programmers. Many users wanted to create [[Wikipedia:Java applet|Java applet]]s. A web browser with Java support would display interactive Java programs in web pages.

Java instead found more use at the server. There are several languages to script web servers, including Perl, Python, and PHP, but many owners of servers preferred Java and the backing of Sun Microsystems. Businesses spoke of &quot;Java&quot; much and the demand for servers with Java 2 Enterprise Edition was high. With Java at the web server, there was no need for clients to upgrade their computers or install Java. {{ref|javaserver}}

To handle large amounts of data, a web server with Java needed a back-end database. A Sun server running Solaris was one way to host such a database. {{ref|database}}

But then, between years 2000 and 2005, came change. Many persons stopped saying &quot;Java&quot; and started saying &quot;Linux&quot;. Businesses started looking for Linux products instead of Java products. Many GNU/Linux distributions provided functionality equal to Solaris. Commercial vendors of database software started providing it for Linux in addition to Solaris. IBM and the United States government became interested with Linux and wrote kernel code for Linux. Servers migrated from Solaris to Linux, which ended their need to pay Solaris licenses. Because Linux is free, licensing is gratis; Linux source code is public and several companies sell support for it.

Sun, which had dropped support for Java at the Macintosh platform, added the Linux platform, bringing the number of Java platforms to three. However, many users became interested in &quot;LAMP&quot;.

LAMP refers to Linux the kernel, Apache the web server, MySQL the database. These are all free, and can all be called Free Software and Open Source, except possibly Apache, for which some users have reservations. But Apache source code, like Linux kernel code and MySQL code, is public without a licensing fee. The &quot;P&quot; of LAMP refers to Perl, PHP, or Python, but never Java. The P-languages are all free, but Java is not.

LAMP asked servers to consider switching from Solaris and other platforms to Linux. Sun wanted to answer &quot;No&quot;. Sun wanted to exploit some advantages that Solaris retained versus Linux and LAMP.

Thus, Sun drafted the &quot;Common Development and Distribution License&quot;, a generalised version of the Mozilla Public License. The Open Source Initiative approved the CDDL license; thus any programme with a CDDL license is now Open Source. Then Sun decided to gradually apply the CDDL license to Solaris code to create a free operating system called OpenSolaris.

Some welcomed OpenSolaris. Some even wanted to create a type of GNU/OpenSolaris, by taking the GNU Compiler Collection and other common tools from the Linux platform and using them to fill gaps in OpenSolaris.

But certain persons warned that the CDDL license was incompatible with the dominant GNU General Public License. For example, code from a CDDL-ed programme cannot be placed into the Linux kernel. They began discouraging the use of CDDL-licensed code.

==More about the relativity of simultaneity==

Most physical theories assume that it is possible to synchronise clocks. If you set up an array of synchronised clocks over a volume of space and take a snapshot of all of them simultaneously, you will find that the one closest to you will appear to show a later time than the others, due to the time light needs to travel from each of the distant clocks towards you. However, if the correct clock positions are known, by taking the transmission time of light into account, one can easily compensate for the differences and synchronise the clocks properly. The possibility of truly synchronising clocks exists because the speed of light is constant and this constant velocity can be used in the synchronisation process (the use of the predictable delays when light is used for synchronising clocks is known as &quot;Einstein synchronisation&quot;).

The Lorentz transformation for time compares the readings of synchronised clocks at any instant. It compares the actual readings on clocks allowing for any time delay due to transmitting information between observers and answers the question &quot;what does the other observer's clock actually read now, at this moment&quot;.  The answer to this question is shocking.  The Lorentz transformation for time shows that the clocks in any frame of reference moving relative to you cease to be synchronised!

[[Image:Inertialoverlay.GIF]] 

The desynchronisation between relatively moving observers is illustrated below with a simpler diagram:

[[image:rel1.gif]]

The effect of the relativity of simultaneity is for each observer to consider that a different set of events is simultaneous.  The relativistic phase difference between clocks (&quot;relativistic phase&quot;) means that observers who are moving relative to each other have different sets of things that are simultaneous, or in their &quot;present moment&quot;.  It is this discovery that time is no longer absolute that profoundly unsettles many students of relativity.  

[[image:Coord6.gif]]

The amount by which the clocks differ between two observers depends upon the distance of the clock from the observer (&lt;math&gt;t = xv/c^2 &lt;/math&gt;).  Notice that if both observers are part of inertial frames of reference with clocks that are synchronised at every point in space then the phase difference can be obtained by simply reading the difference between the clocks at the distant point and clocks at the origin.  This difference will have the same value for both observers.

'''Example: flashing lights'''

Two lights that are stationary with respect to each other are separated by 3000 metres.  The lights flash one after another with a time interval of 4 microseconds between the flashes.  How fast would you need to travel along the line of the lights to see the lights flashing simultaneously?

This problem is a straightforward example of relativistic phase, events that are simultaneous for a moving observer being successive events in their own frame of reference.  The phase difference between clocks with distance is given by:[[File:Twoflashes.jpg|right|Two successive flashes]]

&lt;math&gt;\Delta t = vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt; 

So &lt;math&gt;v = \Delta tc^2/x&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to express &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; as a fraction of the speed of light gives:

&lt;math&gt;v_c = \Delta tc/x&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore: &lt;math&gt; v_c = \frac{4 \times 10^{-6} \times 3 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^3} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;v_c = 0.4 c&lt;/math&gt;

(See the &quot;explosion&quot; example in Scherr et al (2001))

Discuss the relationship between the times that a stationary and a moving observer will assign to the flashes in the example: the Lorentz transformation for the time of an event is &lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma (t - vx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;, it is composed of an elapsed time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and a phase difference, &lt;math&gt;vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. The flashing lights example is arranged so that &lt;math&gt;t = t' = 0&lt;/math&gt; when the observers in the two inertial frames of reference pass each other at the first flash and so that &lt;math&gt;t = t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t' = 0&lt;/math&gt; is the time of the second flash.  

If &lt;math&gt;t' = 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;0 = \gamma (t - vx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt; so, according to the Lorentz transformation the moving observer finds events to be simultaneous in the stationary inertial reference frame when &lt;math&gt;t = vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt;, ie: when the elapsed time in the stationary frame is equal to the phase difference between the frames.

====Example: Relativistic Bug Capture====

How fast would a 1000 m long spaceship need to travel to observe a nanosecond difference between stationary clocks aligned with its bow and stern?

From &lt;math&gt;t = xv/c^2 &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;10^{-9} = 10^3 v/(9 \times 10^{16}) &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;v = 9 \times 10^4 ms^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; or 90 km per second.

This effect could be used to bring together bugs of different ages that are twins in their own inertial frame of reference:

[[Image:Relativisticbugs.jpg|How the relativistic phase difference between clocks in moving and stationary inertial frames provides a moving observer with simultaneous access to different times in the stationary frame.]]

Bill travels past Jim in a very long spaceship and simultaneously captures two bugs, one coincident with the bow of the spaceship and one coincident with the stern. Although the bugs are twins in their own frame of reference they are different ages in Bill's reference frame. The captured bugs are free to wander up and down Bill's spaceship and could meet each other. 

What length of spaceship travelling at 90 km per second would be needed to capture the bugs in the picture?

===The Andromeda Paradox===

What do we mean when we say that events are occuring &quot;now&quot;?  If we are looking out over a cityscape, watching the traffic, lots of things appear to be happening all at once. We can take a snapshot with a camera and the scene on the photo consists of all those things that happened at very nearly the same time.  They are only &quot;very nearly&quot; at the same time because the events on the photo that were furthest away actually occurred slightly earlier than those that were nearby because of the time taken for light to reach the camera. If we want to discover the events that really happened at the same time we would need to subtract the time taken for the light to get to us.  This would be highly necessary if you were observing events on the Moon: if you were on the Earth and saw the time on a lunar clock you would know that the real time on the moon was more than a second later.  But would this be enough?  What about the relativistic phase differences between clocks due to motion?

Special Relativity introduces yet another factor, in addition to the travel time of light, that upsets our knowledge of which events are simultaneous.  The relativistic phase differences between clocks are tiny at the distance of the moon but have the startling consequence that at distances as large as our separation from nearby galaxies an observer who is driving on the earth can have a radically different set of events that are simultaneous with her &quot;present moment&quot; from another person who is standing on the earth. The classic example of this effect of relativistic phase is the &quot;Andromeda Paradox&quot;, also known as the &quot;Rietdijk-Putnam-Penrose&quot; argument. Penrose described the argument:

&quot;Two people pass each other on the street; and according to one of the two people, an Andromedean space fleet has already set off on its journey, while to the other, the decision as to whether or not the journey will actually take place has not yet been made. How can there still be some uncertainty as to the outcome of that decision? If to either person the decision has already been made, then surely there cannot be any uncertainty. The launching of the space fleet is an inevitability.&quot; (Penrose 1989).

The argument is illustrated below:

[[image:rel2.gif]]

Notice that neither observer can actually &quot;see&quot; what is happening on Andromeda now. The argument is not about what can be &quot;seen&quot;, it is purely about what different observers consider to be contained in their instantaneous present moment. The two observers observe the same, two million year old events in their telescopes but the moving observer must assume that events at the present moment on Andromeda are a day or two in advance of those in the present moment of the stationary observer. (Incidentally, the two observers see the same events in their telescopes because length contraction of the distance from Earth to Andromeda compensates exactly for the time difference on Andromeda.)

This &quot;paradox&quot; has generated considerable philosophical debate on the nature of time and free-will. The advanced text of this book provides a discussion of some of the issues surrounding this geometrical interpretation of special relativity.

A result of the relativity of simultaneity is that if the car driver launches a space rocket towards the Andromeda galaxy it might have a several days head start compared with a space rocket launched from the ground.  This is because the &quot;present moment&quot; for the moving car driver is progressively advanced with distance compared with the present moment on the ground.  The present moment for the car driver is shown in the illustration below:

[[image:rel3.gif]]

The net effect of the Andromeda paradox is that when someone is moving towards a distant point there are later events at that point than for someone who is not moving towards the distant point. There is a '''time gap''' between the events in the present moment of the two people.

==The twin paradox==

The &quot;Twin Paradox&quot; derives from an article by Langevin (1911) who used travel to a distant star and back to describe the relationships between times in different inertial reference frames.  Langevin's original example was called the &quot;Clock Paradox&quot; and showed that a space traveller who travels to a distant star and back finds that he has aged less than the people who stay on Earth. Benguigui (2012) provides a detailed account of how, over time, this example became the story of two twins, one who travels out into space and one who stays at home, and how it became described by Weyl in 1922 as the &quot;Twin Paradox&quot;. The &quot;Twin Paradox&quot; is an interesting example of the relativity of simultaneity and time dilation and deserves close study so that these features of Special Relativity can be understood.  However, be warned, the reason that the &quot;twin paradox&quot; has attracted so much puzzlement is that, although superficially a simple problem, the analysis of the various inertial frames of reference is complex.

====A one way trip====

The twin &quot;paradox&quot; consists of two journeys, an outbound journey and a return journey. Much can be learnt about the relativity of simultaneity by considering just the outbound journey without any return. The single journey without any return might consist of the following scenario: Jim stays at home on Earth and Bill goes off in a spaceship, Bill flies past Jim at a velocity of 0.8c, they both set all of their clocks to zero as they pass each other and Bill flies straight to Mars where he drops off a record of his clock reading. Jim, who stays on Earth, finds that Bill's clocks record less time than his own for the journey.

The journey to Mars consists of two inertial frames of reference. In Jim's frame of reference Bill is moving and Jim is stationary.  In Bill's frame of reference Jim, Earth and Mars move and Bill is stationary. There are only two reference frames so questions such as &quot;what does Jim observe if he considers himself to be moving&quot; are equivalent to asking &quot;how does Jim move in Bill's frame of reference?&quot;.

The start of the journey is shown below:

[[File:Twinstart.jpg|Jim and Bill at the start of the journey]]

Suppose for ease of calculation Mars is assumed to be 100 light seconds away from Earth. Jim's view of the journey is straightforward and is shown below:

[[File:Jimsview.jpg|Jim's view of the journey from Earth to Mars]]

If Mars is 100 light seconds away, Jim will time Bill's journey to take 125 seconds (&lt;math&gt;100/0.8&lt;/math&gt;). Relativistic time dilation will cause Bill's clocks to read 75 seconds ie: 

Bill's clocks will read: &lt;math&gt;125/\gamma &lt;/math&gt;  

where gamma is: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = 1.667&lt;/math&gt; 

so &lt;math&gt; 125/1.6667 = 75&lt;/math&gt; seconds.  

In Jim's inertial frame of reference Jim has aged by 125 seconds when Bill gets to Mars but Bill, as a result of time dilation, has only aged by 75 seconds. 

The reason that this lack of aging by Bill seems to be paradoxical is that it might be thought that Jim must also have aged less than Bill, after all, Jim travels away from Bill as much as Bill travels away from Jim so Bill should find Jim to have aged less than himself in the same way as Jim finds Bill to have aged less than himself.  In fact there is no paradox because Bill and Jim have very different ideas of the journey.  Bill's view of the journey is shown below.

[[File:Billsview.jpg|Bill's view of the journey from Earth to Mars]]

As a result of relativistic phase, Bill finds that the clocks on Mars start the journey 80 seconds ahead of his own.  The Martian clocks record another 45 seconds for the journey.  The 45 seconds elapsed time for the journey is what Bill expects when time dilation is taken into account (ie: &lt;math&gt;75/\gamma = 75/1.6667 = 45&lt;/math&gt; seconds). More surprising still, when Bill considers Jim's clock readings back on Earth he finds that only 45 seconds have elapsed on Jim's earth-based clocks during the journey because the 80 seconds of relativistic phase difference mean that Bill's clocks as he passes Mars are simultaneous with events on Earth that are only 45 seconds later than when he passed Earth. 

If Bill had an absurdly long rocket he could use a version of &quot;relativistic bug capture&quot; (see above) to net one of Jim's clocks the moment Bill reaches Mars. Bill could then show there was a Jim on Earth whose clocks had only progressed by 45 seconds for Bill's journey in Bill's inertial frame of reference. If Bill had captured one of Jim's clocks, the Jim who is simultaneous in his own frame of reference with the moment that Bill passes Mars would remember a giant net coming down from the tail of a spaceship and taking one of his clocks 45 seconds after Bill passed him. 

Notice that there are two Jims in this story, one who is simultaneous with the Mars that Bill visits and another who is simultaneous with Bill in Bill's frame of reference.  The Jim who is simultaneous with Bill in Bill's frame of reference would be an earlier Jim than the Jim who is simultaneous in his own frame of reference with Mars when Bill arrives. 

The one way journey is symmetrical in the sense that Jim observes Bill to age less than himself during the journey and Bill also observes an earlier Jim to have aged less than himself.

The one way journey would become fully symmetrical if Bill continued past Mars until his clocks read that 125 seconds had elapsed, at this point he would assess that Jim had experienced 75 seconds of elapsed time. When Jim's clock's read 125 seconds Jim finds Bill's clocks read 75 seconds and, symmetrically, when Bill's clocks read 125 seconds Bill finds that Jim's clocks read 75 seconds. This symmetry is emphasised in the schematic diagram below which compares Jim and Bill's clock readings:

[[File:Clockschematic.jpg|Schematic of Jim and Bill's clock readings]]

====What happens when there is a change of velocity?====

In the previous section it was shown that time dilation is symmetrical when observers separate at a constant velocity. The symmetry is evident in the way that, during the one way journey, Jim observes Bill's clocks to go slow and Bill also observes Jim's clocks to go slow.  The symmetry between the observers means that Bill can regard himself as stationary and observing Jim departing or vice versa. 

[[File:Jimbillviewturn.jpg|Jim and Bill's view of the turn]]

Bill finds that there are two Jims at two separate times involved in going to Mars then suddenly changing direction to return to Earth: these are labelled A and C in the diagram.  The first Jim has clocks that read 45 seconds since Bill passed Earth, this is the Jim who is simultaneous with Bill in Bill's frame of reference as Bill passes Mars.  The second Jim has clocks that read 205 seconds since meeting Bill, this Jim is simultaneous with Bill, in Bill's frame of reference, the moment after he has turned around at Mars and reached a velocity of -0.8c for the return journey.

The lack of any single Jim that is simultaneous with Bill when Bill changes velocity introduces an asymmetry into Special Relativity.  Bill turning around at Mars to come back to Earth is not equivalent to Earth turning to meet Bill because it is not clear, until Bill has made the turn, which Earth and which Jim is making the journey.  Langevin (1911), who first proposed the example of a traveller departing and returning younger, was well aware of the asymmetry and stated that: &quot;Thus the asymmetry – which occurred because only the traveler, in the middle of his journey, has undergone an acceleration that changes the direction of his velocity&quot;.

In Special Relativity the laws of physics are the same for each observer in an inertial frame of reference.  An inertial frame of reference might be all the clocks and measuring rods in a room on board a ship or in an entire city, the crucial feature of an inertial reference frame being that the clocks and measuring rods are stationary with respect to each other. Motions are measured so that the rest of the universe moves relative to the observer's inertial frame of reference.  There are three inertial frames of reference in the example of Bill going to Mars and returning to Earth: Jim, outbound Bill and inbound Bill. Outbound and inbound Bill are separated by a period of varying velocity when Bill turns around.  This period of changing velocity can also be regarded as a non-inertial hiatus in Bill's single inertial reference frame after which the relations between Bill's clocks and measuring rods and those in the rest of the universe have changed. 

Questions such as &quot;how does the Jim who is simultaneous with Bill after the turn view events if he regards himself as moving towards Bill?&quot; are really about the inbound Bill's reference frame.  In Jim's own inertial frame of reference Bill just goes to Mars, turns round and comes back again.  Jim always regards himself as stationary unless his reference frame becomes non-inertial by experiencing a change in velocity in which case Jim would regard himself as moving from one stationary state to another that has a different set of relationships with the universe.  Special Relativity holds that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames, it does not hold that all motion is relative, even in non-inertial changes.

The gap in time between the Jim who is simultaneous with Bill as Bill reaches Mars and the Jim who is simultaneous with Bill as he starts the journey back to Earth is known as the &quot;Time Gap&quot;.  The time gap in the &quot;twin paradox&quot; consists of the sum of the outgoing and incoming phase differences and in this case the time gap is 160 seconds .

====The time gap description of the &quot;twin paradox&quot;====

Once it is accepted that Bill and Jim have very different views of the journey these views can be summarised in the &quot;Time Gap&quot; description of the journey.  In this description Bill flies to Mars and discovers that the clocks there are reading a later time than his own clock. He turns round to fly back to Earth and realises that the relativity of simultaneity means that, for Bill, the clocks on Earth will have jumped forward and are ahead of those on Mars, yet another &quot;time gap&quot; appears. When Bill gets back to Earth the time gaps and time dilations mean that people on Earth have recorded more clock ticks that he did.  

For ease of calculation suppose that Bill is moving at a truly astonishing velocity of 0.8c in the direction of a distant point that is 100 light seconds away (about 30 million kilometres). The illustration below shows Jim and Bill's observations:

[[Image:overalljourney.jpg]]

From Bill's viewpoint there is both a time dilation and a phase effect. It is the added factor of &quot;phase&quot; that explains why, although the time dilation occurs for both observers, Bill observes the same readings on Jim's clocks over the whole journey as does Jim.

To summarise the mathematics of the twin paradox using the example:

Jim observes the distance as 100 light seconds and the distant point is in his frame of reference. According to Jim it takes Bill the following time to make the journey:

:Time taken = distance / velocity  therefore according to Jim:

:&lt;math&gt;t = 100/0.8 = 125&lt;/math&gt; seconds

:Again according to Jim, time dilation should affect the observed time on Bill's clocks:

:&lt;math&gt;T = t \times \sqrt {1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; so:

:&lt;math&gt;T = 125 \times \sqrt {1 - 0.8^2} = 75&lt;/math&gt; seconds

So for Jim the round trip takes 250 secs and Bill's clock reads 150 secs.

Bill measures the distance as: 

:&lt;math&gt;X = x \times \sqrt {1 - v^2/c^2} =  100 \times \sqrt {1 - 0.8^2} = 60&lt;/math&gt; light seconds.

:For Bill it takes &lt;math&gt;X/v = 60/0.8 = 75 &lt;/math&gt; seconds.

Bill observes Jim's clocks to appear to run slow as a result of time dilation:

:&lt;math&gt;t^' = T \times \sqrt {1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; so:

:&lt;math&gt;t^' = 75 \times \sqrt {1 - 0.8^2} = 45&lt;/math&gt; seconds

But there is also a time gap of &lt;math&gt;vx/c^2 = 80 &lt;/math&gt; seconds.

So for Bill, Jim's clocks register 125 secs have passed from the start to the distant point. This is composed of 45 secs elapsing on Jim's clocks at the turn round point plus an 80 secs time gap from the start of the journey. Bill sees 250 secs total time recorded on Jim's clocks over the whole journey, this is the same time as Jim observes on his own clocks.

==The nature of length contraction==

According to special relativity items such as measuring rods consist of events distributed in space and time and a three dimensional rod is the events that compose the rod at a single instant.  However, from the relativity of simultaneity it is evident that two observers in relative motion will have different sets of events that are present at a given instant. This means that two observers moving relative to each other will usually be observing measuring rods that are composed of '''different''' sets of events. If the word &quot;rod&quot; means the three dimensional form of the object called a rod then these two observers in relative motion '''observe different rods'''. 

The way that measuring rods differ between observers can be seen by using a Minkowski diagram. The area of a Minkowski diagram that corresponds to all of the events that compose an object over a period of time is known as the '''worldtube''' of the object. It can be seen in the image below that length contraction is the result of individual observers having different sections of an object's worldtube in their present instant.

[[Image:relcontract.gif]]

(It should be recalled that the longest lengths on space-time diagrams are often the shortest in reality).

It is sometimes said that length contraction occurs because objects rotate into the time axis.  This is actually a half truth, there is no actual rotation of a three dimensional rod, instead the observed three dimensional slice of a four dimensional rod is changed which makes it appear as if the rod has rotated into the time axis. In special relativity it is not the rod that rotates into time, it is the observer's slice of the worldtube of the rod that rotates.

There can be no doubt that the three dimensional slice of the worldtube of a rod does indeed have different lengths for relatively moving observers.  The issue of whether or not the events that compose the worldtube of the rod are always existent is a matter for philosophical speculation.

==More about time dilation==

The term &quot;time dilation&quot; is applied to the way that observers who are moving relative to you record fewer clock ticks between events than you. In special relativity this is not due to properties of the clocks, such as their mechanisms getting heavier.  Indeed, it should not even be said that the clocks tick faster or slower because what is truly occurring is that the clocks record shorter or longer elapsed times and this recording of elapsed time is independent of the mechanism of the clocks. The differences between clock readings are due to the clocks traversing shorter or longer distances between events along an observer's path through spacetime.  This can be seen most clearly by re-examining the Andromeda Paradox.

Suppose Bill passes Jim at high velocity on the way to Mars. Jim has previously synchronised the clocks on Mars with his Earth clocks but for Bill the Martian clocks read times well in advance of Jim's. This means that Bill has a head start because his present instant contains what Jim considers to be the Martian future. Jim observes that '''Bill travels through both space and time''' and expresses this observation by saying that Bill's clocks recorded fewer ticks than his own. Bill achieves this strange time travel by having what Jim considers to be the future of distant objects in his present moment. Bill is literally travelling into future parts of Jim's frame of reference. 

In special relativity time dilation and length contraction are not material effects, they are physical effects due to travel within a four dimensional spacetime.  The mechanisms of the clocks and the structures of measuring rods are irrelevant.  

It is important for advanced students to be aware that special relativity and General Relativity differ about the nature of spacetime.  General Relativity, in the form championed by Einstein, avoids the idea of extended space and time and is what is known as a &quot;relationalist&quot; theory of physics. Special relativity, on the other hand, is a theory where extended spacetime is pre-eminent. The brilliant flowering of physical theory in the early twentieth century has tended to obscure this difference because, within a decade, special relativity had been subsumed within General Relativity. The interpretation of special relativity that is presented here should be learnt before advancing to more advanced interpretations.

==The Pole-barn paradox==

The length contraction in relativity is symmetrical. When two observers in relative motion pass each other they both measure a contraction of length.

[[Image:Rellencon.gif]]

(Note that Minkowski's metric involves the subtraction of displacements in time, so what appear to be the longest lengths on a 2D sheet of paper are often the shortest lengths in a (3+1)D reality).

The symmetry of length contraction leads to two questions. Firstly, how can a succession of events be observed as simultaneous events by another observer? This question led to the concept of de Broglie waves and quantum theory. Secondly, if a rod is simultaneously between two points in one frame how can it be observed as being successively between those points in another frame? For instance, if a pole enters a building at high speed how can one observer find it is fully within the building and another find that the two ends of the rod are opposed to the two ends of the building at successive times? What happens if the rod hits the end of the building? The second question is known as the &quot;pole-barn paradox&quot; or &quot;ladder paradox&quot;.

[[Image:polebarn.GIF]]

The pole-barn paradox states the following: suppose a superhero running at 0.75c and carrying a horizontal pole 15 m long towards a barn 10m long, with front and rear doors. When the runner and the pole are inside the barn, a ground observer closes and then opens both doors (by remote control) so that the runner and pole are momentarily captured inside the barn and then proceed to exit the barn from the back door.

One may be surprised to see a 15-m pole fit inside a 10-m barn. But the pole is in motion with respect to the ground observer, who measures the pole to be contracted to a length of 9.9 m (check using equations).

The “paradox” arises when we consider the runner’s point of view. The runner sees the barn contracted to 6.6 m.  Because the pole is in the rest frame of the runner, the runner measures it to have its proper length of 15 m. Now, how can our superhero make it safely through the barn?

The resolution of the “paradox” lies in the relativity of simultaneity. The closing of the two doors is measured to be simultaneous by the ground observer. However, since the doors are at different positions, the runner says that they do not close simultaneously. The rear door closes and then opens first, allowing the leading edge of the pole to exit. The front door of the barn does not close until the trailing edge of the pole passes by.

What happens if the rear door is kept closed and made out of some impenetrable material? Can we or can we not trap the rod inside the barn by closing the front door while the whole rod is inside according to a ground observer? When the front end of the rod hits the rear door, information about this impact will travel backwards along the rod in the form of a shock wave. The information cannot travel faster than c, so the rear end of the rod will continue to travel forward at its original speed until the wave reaches it. Even if the shock wave is traveling at the speed of light, it will not reach the rear end of the rod until after the rear end has passed through the front door even in the runner's frame. Therefore the whole rod (albeit quite scrunched up) will be inside the barn when the front door closes. If it is infinitely elastic, it will end up compressed and &quot;spring loaded&quot; against the inside of the closed barn.

===Evidence for length contraction, the field of an infinite straight current===


Length contraction can be directly observed in the field of an infinitely straight current. This is shown in the illustration below.

[[Image:relelectro.GIF]]

Non-relativistic electromagnetism describes the electric field due to a charge using:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{\lambda}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r}&lt;/math&gt;

and describes the magnetic field due to an infinitely long straight current using the Biot Savart law:

&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}&lt;/math&gt;

Or using the charge density (from &lt;math&gt;I = \lambda v&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; ):

&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{\mu_0 \lambda v}{2 \pi r}&lt;/math&gt;

Using relativity it is possible to show that the formula for the magnetic field given above can be derived using the relativistic effect of length contraction on the electric field and so what we call the &quot;magnetic&quot; field can be understood as relativistic observations of a single phenomenon.  The relativistic calculation is given below.

If Jim is moving relative to the wire at the same velocity as the negative charges he sees the wire contracted relative to Bill:

&lt;math&gt;l_+ = l \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Bill should see the space between the charges that are moving along the wire to be contracted by the same amount but the requirement for electrical neutrality means that the moving charges will be spread out to match those in the frame of the fixed charges in the wire.

This means that Jim sees the negative charges spread out so that:

&lt;math&gt;l_- = \frac{l}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The net charge density observed by Jim is:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{q}{l_-} - \frac{q}{l_+}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{q}{l} ( \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}})&lt;/math&gt;

Using the binomial expansion:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{q}{l} (1 - \frac{v^2}{2c^2} - 1 - \frac{v^2}{2c^2})&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, allowing for a net positive charge, the positive charges being fixed:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{qv^2}{l c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The electric field at Jim's position is given by:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{\lambda v^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The force due to the electrical field at Jim's position is given by &lt;math&gt;F = Eq&lt;/math&gt; which is:

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{q \lambda v^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, from classical electromagnetism:

&lt;math&gt;c^2 = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0 \mu_0}&lt;/math&gt;

So substituting this into &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{q \lambda v^2}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r c^2}&lt;/math&gt;:

(1) &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{q\mu_0 \lambda v^2}{2 \pi r}&lt;/math&gt;

This is the formula for the relativistic electric force that is observed by Bill as a magnetic force.  How does this compare with the non-relativistic calculation of the magnetic force? The force on a charge at Jim's position due to the magnetic field is, from the classical formula:

&lt;math&gt;F = Bqv&lt;/math&gt;

Which from the Biot-Savart law is:

(2) &lt;math&gt;F = \frac{q\mu_0 \lambda v^2}{2 \pi r}&lt;/math&gt;

which shows that the same formula applies for the relativistic excess electrical force experienced by Jim as the formula for the classical magnetic force.

It can be seen that once the idea of space-time is understood the unification of the two fields is straightforward. Jim is moving relative to the wire at the same speed as the negatively charged current carriers so Jim only experiences an electric field. Bill is stationary relative to the wire and observes that the charges in the wire are balanced whereas Jim observes an imbalance of charge. Bill assigns the attraction between Jim and the current carriers to a &quot;magnetic field&quot;. 

It is important to notice that, in common with the explanation of length contraction given above, the events that constitute the stream of negative charges for Jim are not the same events as constitute the stream of negative charges for Bill.  Bill and Jim's negative charges occupy different moments in time.

Incidently, the drift velocity of electrons in a wire is about a millimetre per second but a huge charge is available in a wire (See link below).

===De Broglie waves===

De Broglie noticed that the differing three dimensional sections of the universe would cause oscillations in the rest frame of an observer to appear as wave trains in the rest frame of observers who are moving.

[[Image:reldebroglie.gif]]

He combined this insight with Einstein's ideas on the quantisation of energy to create the foundations of quantum theory. De Broglie's insight is also a round-about proof of the description of length contraction given above - observers in relative motion have differing three dimensional slices of a four dimensional universe. The existence of matter waves is direct experimental evidence of the relativity of simultaneity.

===Bell's spaceship paradox===

Bell devised a thought experiment called the &quot;Spaceship Paradox&quot; to enquire whether length contraction involved a force and whether this contraction was a contraction of space.  In the Spaceship Paradox two spaceships are connected by a thin, stiff string and are both equally and linearly accelerated to a velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; relative to the ground, at which, in the special relativity version of the paradox, the acceleration ceases.  The acceleration on both spaceships is arranged to be equal according to ground observers so, according to observers on the ground, the spaceships will stay the same distance apart. It is asked whether the string would break. 

It is useful when considering this problem to investigate what happens to a single spaceship. If a spaceship that has rear thrusters is accelerated linearly, according to ground observers, to a velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; then the ground observers will observe it to have contracted in the direction of motion.  The acceleration experienced by the front of the spaceship will have been slightly less than the acceleration experienced by the rear of the spaceship during contraction and then would suddenly reach a high value, equalising the front and rear velocities, once the rear acceleration and increasing contraction had ceased. From the ground it would be observed that overall the acceleration at the rear could be linear but the acceleration at the front would be non-linear.

In Bell's thought experiment both spaceships are artificially constrained to have constant acceleration, according to the ground observers, until the acceleration ceases. Sudden adjustments are not allowed. Furthermore no difference between the accelerations at the front and rear of the assembly are permitted so any tendency towards contraction would need to be borne as tension and extension in the string.

The most interesting part of the paradox is what happens to the space between the ships. From the ground the spaceships will stay the same distance apart (the experiment is arranged to achieve this) whilst according to observers on the spaceships they will appear to become increasingly separated. This implies that acceleration is not invariant between reference frames (see Part II) and the force applied to the spaceships will indeed be affected by the difference in separation of the ships observed by each frame.

The section on the nature of length contraction above shows that as the string changes velocity the observers on the ground observe a changing set of events that compose the string. These new events define a string that is shorter than the original. This means that the string will indeed attempt to contract as observed from the ground and will be drawn out under tension as observed from the spaceships. If the string were unable to bear the extension and tension in the moving frame or the tension in the rest frame it would break. 

Another interesting aspect of Bell's Spaceship Paradox is that in the inertial frames of the ships, owing to the relativity of simultaneity, the lead spaceship will always be moving slightly faster than the rear spaceship so the spaceship-string system does not form a true inertial frame of reference until the acceleration ceases in the frames of reference of both ships.  The asynchrony of the cessation of acceleration shows that the lead ship reaches the final velocity before the rear ship in the frame of reference of either ship. However, this time difference is very slight (less than the time taken for an influence to travel down the string at the speed of light &lt;math&gt;x/c &gt; vx/c^2 &lt;/math&gt;). 

It is necessary at this stage to give a warning about extrapolating special relativity into the domain of general relativity (GR). SR cannot be applied with confidence to accelerating systems which is why the comments above have been confined to qualitative observations.

==The transverse doppler effect==

The existence of time dilation means that the frequency of light emitted from a source that is moving towards or away from an observer should be red shifted in directions that are perpendicular to the direction of motion.  The transverse doppler effect is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\nu = \nu^{\prime} \sqrt{ 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the observed frequency and &lt;math&gt;\nu^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency if the source were stationary relative to the observer (the '''proper frequency''').

This effect was first confirmed by Ives and Stillwell in 1938.  The transverse doppler effect is a purely relativistic effect and has been used as an example of proof that time dilation occurs.

==Relativistic transformation of angles==

If a rod makes an angle with its direction of motion toward or away from an observer the component of its length in the direction of motion will be contracted.  This means that observed angles are also transformed during changes of frames of reference.  Assuming that motion occurs along the x-axis, suppose the rod has a proper length (rest length) of &lt;math&gt;L^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; metres and makes an angle of &lt;math&gt;\theta^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;degrees with the x'-axis in its rest frame.  The tangent of the angle made with the axes is:

:Tangent in rest frame of rod = &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta^{\prime} = \frac{L^{\prime}_y}{L^{\prime}_x}&lt;/math&gt;

:Tangent in observer's frame  = &lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac{L_y}{L_x}&lt;/math&gt;

:Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\tan \theta}{\tan \theta^{\prime}} =  \frac {L_y L^{\prime}_x} {L^{\prime}_y L_x}&lt;/math&gt;

:But &lt;math&gt;L_x = L^{\prime}_x \sqrt {1 - v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:And &lt;math&gt;L_y = L^{\prime}_y&lt;/math&gt;

:So

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta =\frac {\tan \theta^{\prime}} {\sqrt {1 - v^2/c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Showing that angles with the direction of motion are observed to increase with velocity.

The angle made by a ''moving'' object with the x-axis also involves a transformation of velocities to calculate the correct angle of incidence.

==Addition of velocities==

How can two observers, moving at v m/sec relative to each other, compare their observations of the velocity of a third object?

[[Image:relvel.gif]]

Suppose one of the observers measures the velocity of the object as &lt;math&gt;u^'&lt;/math&gt; where:

&lt;math&gt;u^' =  \frac{x^'}{t^'}&lt;/math&gt;

The coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t^'&lt;/math&gt; are given by the Lorentz transformations:

&lt;math&gt;x^' = \frac{x - vt}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;t^' = \frac{t - (v/c^2)x}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;

but

&lt;math&gt;x^' =  u^' t^'&lt;/math&gt;

so:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{x - vt}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} = u^' \frac{t - (v/c^2)x}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}}&lt;/math&gt;

and hence:

&lt;math&gt;x - vt = u^' ( t - vx/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

Notice the role of the phase term &lt;math&gt;vx/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. The equation can be rearranged as:

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{(u^' + v)}{(1 + u^'v/c^2)} t&lt;/math&gt;

given that &lt;math&gt;x =  u t&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{(u^' + v)}{(1 + u^'v/c^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the '''relativistic velocity addition theorem''', it applies to velocities parallel to the direction of mutual motion. 

The existence of time dilation means that even when objects are moving perpendicular to the direction of motion there is a discrepancy between the velocities reported for an object by observers who are moving relative to each other. If there is any component of velocity in the x direction (&lt;math&gt;{u_x} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{{u^'}_x}&lt;/math&gt;) then the phase affects time measurement and hence the velocities perpendicular to the x-axis. The table below summarises the relativistic addition of velocities in the various directions in space.

&lt;/TABLE&gt;
Notice that for an observer in another reference frame the sum of two velocities (u and v) can never exceed the speed of light.  This means that the speed of light is the maximum velocity in any frame of reference.</text>

&lt;p&gt;The speech disorder associated with [[w:Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's disease]] is also characterized by low volume and poor articulation. The combination sounds like mumbling. The standard treatment for Parkinson's speech is [http://www.lsvt.org/ Lee Silverman Voice Therapy]. LSVT focuses on increasing vocal volume, largely through consciously increasing airflow and vocal fold activity. A secondary benefit is improved articulation or vocal clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

==Mathematics of the Lorentz Transformation Equations==

Consider two observers  &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O^'&lt;/math&gt;, moving at velocity &lt;math&gt;v \,&lt;/math&gt; relative to each other who synchronise their clocks so that &lt;math&gt;t=t^'=0&lt;/math&gt; as they pass each other. They both observe the same event as a flash of light.  How will the coordinates recorded by the observers of the event that produced the light be interrelated?

The relationship between the coordinates can be derived using linear algebra on the basis of the postulates of relativity and an extra homogeneity  and isotropy assumption.

'''The homogeneity and isotropy assumption''': space is uniform and homogeneous in all directions.  If this were not the case then when comparing lengths between coordinate systems the lengths would depend upon the position of the measurement.  For instance, if &lt;math&gt; x^' = a x^2 \,&lt;/math&gt; the distance between two points would depend upon position. 

The linear equations relating coordinates in the primed and unprimed frames are:

: &lt;math&gt;x^' = a_{11} x + a_{12} y + a_{13} z  + a_{14} t \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y^' = a_{21} x + a_{22} y + a_{23} z  + a_{24} t \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z^' = a_{31} x + a_{32} y + a_{33} z  + a_{34} t \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t^' = a_{41} x + a_{42} y + a_{43} z  + a_{44} t \,&lt;/math&gt;

There is no relative motion in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; directions so, according to the 'relativity' postulate:

: &lt;math&gt;z^' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y^' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

: &lt;math&gt;a_{22} = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{21} = a_{23} = a_{24} = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;a_{33} = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{31} = a_{32} = a_{34} = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

So the following equations remain to be solved:

: &lt;math&gt;x^' = a_{11} x + a_{12} y + a_{13} z  + a_{14} t \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t^' = a_{41} x + a_{42} y + a_{43} z  + a_{44} t \,&lt;/math&gt;

If space is isotropic (the same in all directions) then the motion of clocks should be independent of the y and z axes (otherwise clocks placed symmetrically around the x-axis would appear to disagree).  Hence:

: &lt;math&gt; a_{42} = a_{43} = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

so:

: &lt;math&gt;t^' = a_{41} x + a_{44} t \,&lt;/math&gt;

Events satisfying &lt;math&gt;x^' = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; must also satisfy &lt;math&gt;x = vt \,&lt;/math&gt;. So:

: &lt;math&gt;0 = a_{11} vt + a_{12} y + a_{13} z  + a_{14} t \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;-a_{11} vt = a_{12} y + a_{13} z  + a_{14} t \,&lt;/math&gt;

Given that the equations are linear then &lt;math&gt;a_{12} y + a_{13} z = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; and:

: &lt;math&gt;-a_{11} vt = a_{14} t \,&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;-a_{11} v = a_{14} \,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore the correct transformation equation for &lt;math&gt;x^' \,&lt;/math&gt; is:

: &lt;math&gt;x^' = a_{11} (x - vt) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The analysis to date gives the following equations:

: &lt;math&gt;x^' = a_{11} (x - vt) \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y^' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z^' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t^' = a_{41} x + a_{44} t \,&lt;/math&gt;


Assuming that the speed of light is constant, the coordinates of a flash of light that expands as a sphere will satisfy the following equations in each coordinate system:

: &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = c^2t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x^{'2} + y^{'2} + z^{'2} = c^2t^{'2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the coordinate transformation equations into the second equation gives:

: &lt;math&gt;a_{11}^2(x - vt)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = c^2(a_{41}x + a_{44}t)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

rearranging:

: &lt;math&gt;(a_{11}^2 - c^2 a_{41}^2)x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2(va_{11}^2 + c^2a_{41} a_{44}) xt = (c^2 a_{44}^2 - v^2 a_{11}^2)t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

We demand that this is equivalent with

: &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = c^2t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

So we get:

: &lt;math&gt; c^2 a_{44}^2 - v^2 a_{11}^2 = c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; a_{11}^2 - c^2 a_{41}^2 = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;va_{11}^2 + c^2a_{41} a_{44} = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;


Solving these 3 simultaneous equations gives:

: &lt;math&gt; a_{44} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; a_{11} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; a_{41} = -\frac{v/c^2}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these values into:

: &lt;math&gt;x^' = a_{11} (x - vt) \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y^' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z^' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t^' = a_{41} x + a_{44} t \,&lt;/math&gt;

gives:

: &lt;math&gt;x^' = \frac{x - vt}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y^' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z^' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t^' = \frac{t - (v/c^2)x}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The inverse transformation is:

: &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{x^' + vt^'}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y = y^' \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;z = z^' \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{t^' + (v/c^2)x^'}{\sqrt{(1 - v^2/c^2)}} \,&lt;/math&gt;


===Einstein's original approach===

How would two observers measure the position and timing of an event by using light rays if the speed of light were constant? 
The modern analysis of this problem, exposing the assumptions involved, is given above but Einstein's original reasoning (Einstein 1905,1920) is as follows.

Light is transmitted along the positive x axis according to the equation &lt;math&gt;x = ct&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of light.  This can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;x - ct = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Another observer, moving relatively to the first may find different values for x and t but the same equation will apply:

:&lt;math&gt;x^' - ct^' = 0&lt;/math&gt;

A simple relationship between these formulae, which apply to the same event is:

:&lt;math&gt;(x^' - ct^') = \lambda (x - ct)&lt;/math&gt;


Light is transmitted along the negative x axis according to the equation &lt;math&gt;x = -ct&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of light.  This can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;x + ct = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x^' + ct^' = 0&lt;/math&gt;

And:

:&lt;math&gt;(x^' + ct^') = \mu (x + ct)&lt;/math&gt;

Adding the equations and substituting &lt;math&gt;a = \frac{\lambda + \mu}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b = \frac{\lambda - \mu}{2}&lt;/math&gt;:

:(1) &lt;math&gt;x' = ax - bct&lt;/math&gt;
:(2) &lt;math&gt;ct' = act - bx&lt;/math&gt;

The origin of one set of coordinates can be set so that &lt;math&gt;x^' = 0&lt;/math&gt; hence:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{bc}{a} t&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of one observer relative to the other then &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{x}{t}&lt;/math&gt; and:

:(3) &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{bc}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

At &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;:

:(4) &lt;math&gt;x^' = ax&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore two points separated by unit distance in the primed frame of reference ie: when &lt;math&gt;x^' = 1&lt;/math&gt; have the following separation in the unprimed frame:

:(5) &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \frac{1}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

Now &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; can be eliminated from equations (1) and (2) and combined with &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{bc}{a}&lt;/math&gt; and (4) to give in the case where &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t^' = 0&lt;/math&gt;:

:(6) &lt;math&gt;x^' = a (1 -\frac{v^2}{c^2}) x&lt;/math&gt;

And, if &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = 1&lt;/math&gt;:

:(7) &lt;math&gt;\Delta x^' = a (1 -\frac{v^2}{c^2})&lt;/math&gt;

Now if the two moving systems are identical and the situation is symmetrical a measurement in the unprimed system of a division showing one metre on a measuring rod in the primed system is going to be identical to a measurement in the primed system of a division showing one metre on a measuring rod in the unprimed system.  Thus (5) and (7) can be combined so that:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{a} = a (1 -\frac{v^2}{c^2})&lt;/math&gt;

So:

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 = \frac {1}{(1 -\frac{v^2}{c^2})}&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this value for &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; into equations (1) and (2) and solving for &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; gives:


:&lt;math&gt; x^' = \frac {x - vt}{\sqrt {1 -\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt; t^' = \frac {t - (v/c^2)x}{\sqrt {1 -\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the '''Lorentz Transformation Equations''' for events on the x axis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== To the people who assembled this wikibook, thank you! ==

I once went to a presentation by a friend who made himself a wicked cool little MythTV box in one of those sexy transparent plastic cases, about one cubic foot, and he did a demo of all kinds of wild and fascinating stuff. I got greedy for one, but couldn't find enough knowledge to do it, and ended up with a Tivo (with the lifetime subscription).

I'd be interested to see a comparison of the merits of a MythTV box compared to a Tivo box. What I myself know on the topic is that a MythTV box can do some things a Tivo can't, and the video is in an open format. The Tivo gets commercially supported, which is good and bad; the bad side is that there's a lot of advertising for what studios and broadcasters want me to see, and a bit less emphasis on my own choices. I know MythTV uses XMLTV listings and other stuff. Do you find that gives full coverage of what's available? Are there lapses for some cable TV providers? Just curious.

:(Note: I started this wikibook and added the first wave of content.)
:I hope people are finding this wikibook helpful for setting up their own functional MythTV. Mine is working great and I love it. The fact is (as it says in the wikibook), MythTV can do a LOT more than any commercial offering. The downside is that you have to get your hands dirty sometimes to configure and maintain it. It's been worth it, for me.
:MythTV is NOT for people who want a &quot;just works&quot; machine. They should get a Tivo. I've heard lots of good things about Tivo, but I'm a control freak. I want to be able to transfer shows to different places. For instance, burning episodes of TV shows to DVD is very useful... or I can transfer them to a laptop for a trip (as far as I know, that's not possible with Tivo).
:XMLTV has always been pretty accurate for me. I have digital cable, so I get a listing with my cable box (although MythTV has to use XMLTV, the cable company doesn't make it possible to interface with the cable box). Whenver the XMLTV listing is wrong, so is the listing in my cable box... that is, the only problems occur when they change around show times at the last minute (or when sports shows run long, etc.). You can't blame XMLTV or MythTV for that. Again, I emphasize that XMLTV had a full listing for every channel that I get (I'm in Canada, by the way), but obviously it might vary from region to region. This is just my experience.

In 1787 the Constitutional Convention drafted a proposed new charter for the government of the United States.  The Constitution was designed to make the federal government a more effective means to avoid wasteful tariff competition amongs the 13 states and to pay off the national debt.  The Articles of Confederation's shortcomings led to the

The question to be settled is &quot;Who gets the last word?&quot;  In the pre-amble it clearly states &quot;We the People&quot; and that's the understanding that led to the use of separate ratifying conventions in each state.

While some view Constitutional law, like Larry Kramer, as more than just the courts's review of the actions of government, most people limit the topic to just the work of the courts and mainly the United States Supreme Court at that.

After covering the origin of Judicial Review, there are two main areas of ConLaw: Rights of persons and citizens - and - powers of government.

=== Dr. Bonham’s Case === 
8 Co. Rep. 107a, 114a C.P. 1610.  Full text available [http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendV_due_processs1.html here]

Parliament passed a law authorizing the College of Physicians in London [CPL] to fine -and possibly imprison- anyone who practiced medicine in London for more then a month who was not a CPL graduate.  Continued defiance of the law carried the possibility of immediate imprisonment and an additional fine.  The CPL collected half of every fine imposed.  Dr. Thomas Bonham graduated from medical school in Cambridge; and was charged with the unlicensed practice of medicine in London.  He was fined, imprisoned, and sued to get his release.    

Before moving into Coke’s opinion some old uses of contemporary words need to be accounted for.  The CPL is a “censor” in that it is restricting the practice of medicine, in the same way that today one thinks of a censor as restricting the free flow of information.  The CPL also acts as a “party” to the case, because it stands to benefit from any judgments against unlicensed doctors. Lord Coke begins his analysis by saying that no one can be both a “censor” and a “party” to the same case.  

Now Coke runs into a problem because CPL is authorized by statue to operate in both capacities.  Coke’s solution is to find that “…in many cases, the common law will controul acts of parliament, and sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void: for when an act of parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law will controul it, and adjudge such act to be void” [original spelling].  Notice what Coke is doing; the British Parliament was seen as a democratically elected body, and the judiciary was not.  In order to claim the authority to overturn an act of Parliament, Coke is implicitly asserting the supremacy of the judiciary over the legislature.

=== The Federalist # 78 - The Judiciary Department===
[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers/No._78 Link to Full Text]

To the People of the State of New York:

WE PROCEED now to an examination of the judiciary department of the proposed government...

Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive, that, in a government in which they are separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The Executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.

This simple view of the matter suggests several important consequences. It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power; that it can never attack with success either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks. It equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive. For I agree, that &quot;there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.&quot; And it proves, in the last place, that as liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have every thing to fear from its union with either of the other departments; that as all the effects of such a union must ensue from a dependence of the former on the latter, notwithstanding a nominal and apparent separation; that as, from the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continual jeopardy of being overpowered, awed, or influenced by its co-ordinate branches; and that as nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office, this quality may therefore be justly regarded as an indispensable ingredient in its constitution, and, in a great measure, as the citadel of the public justice and the public security.

The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex-post-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.

Some perplexity respecting the rights of the courts to pronounce legislative acts void, because contrary to the Constitution, has arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power. It is urged that the authority which can declare the acts of another void, must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void. As this doctrine is of great importance in all the American constitutions, a brief discussion of the ground on which it rests cannot be unacceptable.

There is no position which depends on clearer principles, than that every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.

If it be said that the legislative body are themselves the constitutional judges of their own powers, and that the construction they put upon them is conclusive upon the other departments, it may be answered, that this cannot be the natural presumption, where it is not to be collected from any particular provisions in the Constitution. It is not otherwise to be supposed, that the Constitution could intend to enable the representatives of the people to substitute their WILL to that of their constituents. It is far more rational to suppose, that the courts were designed to be an intermediate body between the people and the legislature, in order, among other things, to keep the latter within the limits assigned to their authority. The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.

Nor does this conclusion by any means suppose a superiority of the judicial to the legislative power. It only supposes that the power of the people is superior to both; and that where the will of the legislature, declared in its statutes, stands in opposition to that of the people, declared in the Constitution, the judges ought to be governed by the latter rather than the former. They ought to regulate their decisions by the fundamental laws, rather than by those which are not fundamental.

This exercise of judicial discretion, in determining between two contradictory laws, is exemplified in a familiar instance. It not uncommonly happens, that there are two statutes existing at one time, clashing in whole or in part with each other, and neither of them containing any repealing clause or expression. In such a case, it is the province of the courts to liquidate and fix their meaning and operation. So far as they can, by any fair construction, be reconciled to each other, reason and law conspire to dictate that this should be done; where this is impracticable, it becomes a matter of necessity to give effect to one, in exclusion of the other. The rule which has obtained in the courts for determining their relative validity is, that the last in order of time shall be preferred to the first. But this is a mere rule of construction, not derived from any positive law, but from the nature and reason of the thing. It is a rule not enjoined upon the courts by legislative provision, but adopted by themselves, as consonant to truth and propriety, for the direction of their conduct as interpreters of the law. They thought it reasonable, that between the interfering acts of an EQUAL authority, that which was the last indication of its will should have the preference.

But in regard to the interfering acts of a superior and subordinate authority, of an original and derivative power, the nature and reason of the thing indicate the converse of that rule as proper to be followed. They teach us that the prior act of a superior ought to be preferred to the subsequent act of an inferior and subordinate authority; and that accordingly, whenever a particular statute contravenes the Constitution, it will be the duty of the judicial tribunals to adhere to the latter and disregard the former.

It can be of no weight to say that the courts, on the pretense of a repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature. This might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute. The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should be disposed to exercise WILL instead of JUDGMENT, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if it prove any thing, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body...

That inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of the Constitution, and of individuals, which we perceive to be indispensable in the courts of justice, can certainly not be expected from judges who hold their offices by a temporary commission. Periodical appointments, however regulated, or by whomsoever made, would, in some way or other, be fatal to their necessary independence. If the power of making them was committed either to the Executive or legislature, there would be danger of an improper complaisance to the branch which possessed it; if to both, there would be an unwillingness to hazard the displeasure of either; if to the people, or to persons chosen by them for the special purpose, there would be too great a disposition to consult popularity, to justify a reliance that nothing would be consulted but the Constitution and the laws...

''PUBLIUS.

==== Why The Federalist Matters ====

=== Marbury v. Madison ===
U.S. Supreme Court 
MARBURY v. MADISON, 5 U.S. 137 (1803) 
5 U.S. 137 (Cranch) 

Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the court. 

By the constitution of the United States, the president is invested with certain important political powers, in the [5 U.S. 137, 166]   exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience. To aid him in the performance of these duties, he is authorized to appoint certain officers, who act by his authority and in conformity with his orders. 

In such cases, their acts are his acts; and whatever opinion may be entertained of the manner in which executive discretion may be used, still there exists, and can exist, no power to control that discretion. The subjects are political. They respect the nation, not individual rights, and being entrusted to the executive, the decision of the executive is conclusive. The application of this remark will be perceived by adverting to the act of congress for establishing the department of foreign affairs. This officer, as his duties were prescribed by that act, is to conform precisely to the will of the president. He is the mere organ by whom that will is communicated. The acts of such an officer, as an officer, can never be examinable by the courts. 

But when the legislature proceeds to impose on that officer other duties; when he is directed peremptorily to perform certain acts; when the rights of individuals are dependent on the performance of those acts; he is so far the officer of the law; is amenable to the laws for his conduct; and cannot at his discretion sport away the vested rights of others. 

The conclusion from this reasoning is, that where the heads of departments are the political or confidential agents of the executive, merely to execute the will of the president, or rather to act in cases in which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion, nothing can be more perfectly clear than that their acts are only politically examinable. But where a specific duty is assigned by law, and individual rights depend upon the performance of that duty, it seems equally clear that the individual who considers himself injured has a right to resort to the laws of his country for a remedy. 

If this be the rule, let us inquire how it applies to the case under the consideration of the court. [5 U.S. 137, 167]   The power of nominating to the senate, and the power of appointing the person nominated, are political powers, to be exercised by the president according to his own discretion. When he has made an appointment, he has exercised his whole power, and his discretion has been completely applied to the case. If, by law, the officer be removable at the will of the president, then a new appointment may be immediately made, and the rights of the officer are terminated. But as a fact which has existed cannot be made never to have existed, the appointment cannot be annihilated; and consequently if the officer is by law not removable at the will of the president, the rights he has acquired are protected by the law, and are not resumable by the president. They cannot be extinguished by executive authority, and he has the privilege of asserting them in like manner as if they had been derived from any other source. 

The question whether a right has vested or not, is, in its nature, judicial, and must be tried by the judicial authority, If, for example, Mr. Marbury had taken the oaths of a magistrate, and proceeded to act as one; in consequence of which a suit had been instituted against him, in which his defence had depended on his being a magistrate; the validity of his appointment must have been determined by judicial authority. 

So, if he conceives that by virtue of his appointment he has a legal right either to the commission which has been made out for him or to a copy of that commission, it is equally a question examinable in a court, and the decision of the court upon it must depend on the opinion entertained of his appointment. 

That question has been discussed, and the opinion is, that the latest point of time which can be taken as that at which the appointment was complete, and evidenced, was when, after the signature of the president, the seal of the United States was affixed to the commission. 

It is then the opinion of the court, 

...

It is scarcely necessary for the court to disclaim all pretensions to such a jurisdiction. An extravagance, so absurd and excessive, could not have been entertained for a moment. The province of the court is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals, not to inquire how the executive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a discretion. Questions, in their nature political, or which are, by the constitution and laws, submitted to the executive, can never be made in this court. 

But, if this be not such a question; if so far from being an intrusion into the secrets of the cabinet, it respects a paper, which, according to law, is upon record, and to a copy of which the law gives a right, on the payment of ten cents; if it be no intermeddling with a subject, over which the executive can be considered as having exercised any control; what is there in the exalted station of the officer, which shall bar a citizen from asserting, in a court of justice, his legal rights, or shall forbid a court to listen to the claim; or to issue a mandamus, directing the performance of a duty, not depending on executive discretion, but on particular acts of congress and the general principles of law? 

If one of the heads of departments commits any illegal act, under colour of his office, by which an individual sustains an injury, it cannot be pretended that his office alone exempts him from being sued in the ordinary mode of proceeding, and being compelled to obey the judgment of the law. How then can his office exempt him from this particular mode of deciding on the legality of his conduct, if the case be such a case as would, were any other individual the party complained of, authorize the process? 

It is not by the office of the person to whom the writ is directed, but the nature of the thing to be done, that the propriety or impropriety of issuing a mandamus is to be determined. Where the head of a department acts in a case in which executive discretion is to be exercised; in which he is the mere organ of executive will; it is [5 U.S. 137, 171]   again repeated, that any application to a court to control, in any respect, his conduct, would be rejected without hesitation. 

But where he is directed by law to do a certain act affecting the absolute rights of individuals, in the performance of which he is not placed under the particular direction of the president, and the performance of which the president cannot lawfully forbid, and therefore is never presumed to have forbidden; as for example, to record a commission, or a patent for land, which has received all the legal solemnities; or to give a copy of such record; in such cases, it is not perceived on what ground the courts of the country are further excused from the duty of giving judgment, that right to be done to an injured individual, than if the same services were to be performed by a person not the head of a department. 

This opinion seems not now for the first time to be taken up in this country. 

It must be well recollected that in 1792 an act passed, directing the secretary at war to place on the pension list such disabled officers and soldiers as should be reported to him by the circuit courts, which act, so far as the duty was imposed on the courts, was deemed unconstitutional; but some of the judges, thinking that the law might be executed by them in the character of commissioners, proceeded to act and to report in that character. 

This law being deemed unconstitutional at the circuits, was repealed, and a different system was established; but the question whether those persons, who had been reported by the judges, as commissioners, were entitled, in consequence of that report, to be placed on the pension list, was a legal question, properly determinable in the courts, although the act of placing such persons on the list was to be performed by the head of a department. 

That this question might be properly settled, congress passed an act in February 1793, making it the duty of the secretary of war, in conjunction with the attorney general, to take such measures as might be necessary to obtain an adjudication of the supreme court of the United [5 U.S. 137, 172]   States on the validity of any such rights, claimed under the act aforesaid. 

After the passage of this act, a mandamus was moved for, to be directed to the secretary at war, commanding him to place on the pension list a person stating himself to be on the report of the judges. 

There is, therefore, much reason to believe, that this mode of trying the legal right of the complainant, was deemed by the head of a department, and by the highest law officer of the United States, the most proper which could be selected for the purpose. 

When the subject was brought before the court the decision was, not, that a mandamus would not lie to the head of a department, directing him to perform an act, enjoined by law, in the performance of which an individual had a vested interest; but that a mandamus ought not to issue in that case-the decision necessarily to be made if the report of the commissioners did not confer on the applicant a legal right. 

The judgment in that case is understood to have decided the merits of all claims of that description; and the persons, on the report of the commissioners, found it necessary to pursue the mode prescribed by the law subsequent to that which had been deemed unconstitutional, in order to place themselves on the pension list. 

The doctrine, therefore, now advanced is by no means a novel one. 

It is true that the mandamus, now moved for, is not for the performance of an act expressly enjoined by statute. 

It is to deliver a commission; on which subjects the acts of congress are silent. This difference is not considered as affecting the case. It has already been stated that the applicant has, to that commission, a vested legal right, of which the executive cannot deprive him. He has been appointed to an office, from which he is not removable at the will of the executive; and being so [5 U.S. 137, 173]   appointed, he has a right to the commission which the secretary has received from the president for his use. The act of congress does not indeed order the secretary of state to send it to him, but it is placed in his hands for the person entitled to it; and cannot be more lawfully withheld by him, than by another person. 

It was at first doubted whether the action of detinue was not a specific legal remedy for the commission which has been withheld from Mr. Marbury; in which case a mandamus would be improper. But this doubt has yielded to the consideration that the judgment in detinue is for the thing itself, or its value. The value of a public office not to be sold, is incapable of being ascertained; and the applicant has a right to the office itself, or to nothing. He will obtain the office by obtaining the commission, or a copy of it from the record. 

This, then, is a plain case of a mandamus, either to deliver the commission, or a copy of it from the record; and it only remains to be inquired, 

Whether it can issue from this court. 

The act to establish the judicial courts of the United States authorizes the supreme court 'to issue writs of mandamus, in cases warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any courts appointed, or persons holding office, under the authority of the United States.' 

The secretary of state, being a person, holding an office under the authority of the United States, is precisely within the letter of the description; and if this court is not authorized to issue a writ of mandamus to such an officer, it must be because the law is unconstitutional, and therefore absolutely incapable of conferring the authority, and assigning the duties which its words purport to confer and assign. 

The constitution vests the whole judicial power of the United States in one supreme court, and such inferior courts as congress shall, from time to time, ordain and establish. This power is expressly extended to all cases arising under the laws of the United States; and consequently, in some form, may be exercised over the present [5 U.S. 137, 174]   case; because the right claimed is given by a law of the United States. 

In the distribution of this power it is declared that 'the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party. In all other cases, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction.' 

It has been insisted at the bar, that as the original grant of jurisdiction to the supreme and inferior courts is general, and the clause, assigning original jurisdiction to the supreme court, contains no negative or restrictive words; the power remains to the legislature to assign original jurisdiction to that court in other cases than those specified in the article which has been recited; provided those cases belong to the judicial power of the United States. 

If it had been intended to leave it in the discretion of the legislature to apportion the judicial power between the supreme and inferior courts according to the will of that body, it would certainly have been useless to have proceeded further than to have defined the judicial power, and the tribunals in which it should be vested. The subsequent part of the section is mere surplusage, is entirely without meaning, if such is to be the construction. If congress remains at liberty to give this court appellate jurisdiction, where the constitution has declared their jurisdiction shall be original; and original jurisdiction where the constitution has declared it shall be appellate; the distribution of jurisdiction made in the constitution, is form without substance. 

Affirmative words are often, in their operation, negative of other objects than those affirmed; and in this case, a negative or exclusive sense must be given to them or they have no operation at all. 

It cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect; and therefore such construction is inadmissible, unless the words require it. [5 U.S. 137, 175]   If the solicitude of the convention, respecting our peace with foreign powers, induced a provision that the supreme court should take original jurisdiction in cases which might be supposed to affect them; yet the clause would have proceeded no further than to provide for such cases, if no further restriction on the powers of congress had been intended. That they should have appellate jurisdiction in all other cases, with such exceptions as congress might make, is no restriction; unless the words be deemed exclusive of original jurisdiction. 

When an instrument organizing fundamentally a judicial system, divides it into one supreme, and so many inferior courts as the legislature may ordain and establish; then enumerates its powers, and proceeds so far to distribute them, as to define the jurisdiction of the supreme court by declaring the cases in which it shall take original jurisdiction, and that in others it shall take appellate jurisdiction, the plain import of the words seems to be, that in one class of cases its jurisdiction is original, and not appellate; in the other it is appellate, and not original. If any other construction would render the clause inoperative, that is an additional reason for rejecting such other construction, and for adhering to the obvious meaning. 

To enable this court then to issue a mandamus, it must be shown to be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, or to be necessary to enable them to exercise appellate jurisdiction. 

It has been stated at the bar that the appellate jurisdiction may be exercised in a variety of forms, and that if it be the will of the legislature that a mandamus should be used for that purpose, that will must be obeyed. This is true; yet the jurisdiction must be appellate, not original. 

It is the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction, that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that case. Although, therefore, a mandamus may be directed to courts, yet to issue such a writ to an officer for the delivery of a paper, is in effect the same as to sustain an original action for that paper, and therefore seems not to belong to [5 U.S. 137, 176]   appellate, but to original jurisdiction. Neither is it necessary in such a case as this, to enable the court to exercise its appellate jurisdiction. 

The authority, therefore, given to the supreme court, by the act establishing the judicial courts of the United States, to issue writs of mandamus to public officers, appears not to be warranted by the constitution; and it becomes necessary to inquire whether a jurisdiction, so conferred, can be exercised. 

The question, whether an act, repugnant to the constitution, can become the law of the land, is a question deeply interesting to the United States; but, happily, not of an intricacy proportioned to its interest. It seems only necessary to recognise certain principles, supposed to have been long and well established, to decide it. 

That the people have an original right to establish, for their future government, such principles as, in their opinion, shall most conduce to their own happiness, is the basis on which the whole American fabric has been erected. The exercise of this original right is a very great exertion; nor can it nor ought it to be frequently repeated. The principles, therefore, so established are deemed fundamental. And as the authority, from which they proceed, is supreme, and can seldom act, they are designed to be permanent. 

This original and supreme will organizes the government, and assigns to different departments their respective powers. It may either stop here; or establish certain limits not to be transcended by those departments. 

The government of the United States is of the latter description. The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing; if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained? The distinction between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if those limits do not confine the persons on whom they are imposed, and if acts pro- [5 U.S. 137, 177]   hibited and acts allowed are of equal obligation. It is a proposition too plain to be contested, that the constitution controls any legislative act repugnant to it; or, that the legislature may alter the constitution by an ordinary act. 

Between these alternatives there is no middle ground. The constitution is either a superior, paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and like other acts, is alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it. 

If the former part of the alternative be true, then a legislative act contrary to the constitution is not law: if the latter part be true, then written constitutions are absurd attempts, on the part of the people, to limit a power in its own nature illimitable. 

Certainly all those who have framed written constitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and consequently the theory of every such government must be, that an act of the legislature repugnant to the constitution is void. 

This theory is essentially attached to a written constitution, and is consequently to be considered by this court as one of the fundamental principles of our society. It is not therefore to be lost sight of in the further consideration of this subject. 

If an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts and oblige them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be not law, does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be to overthrow in fact what was established in theory; and would seem, at first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however, receive a more attentive consideration. 

It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. [5 U.S. 137, 178]   So if a law be in opposition to the constitution: if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law: the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of judicial duty. 

If then the courts are to regard the constitution; and he constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature; the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply. 

Those then who controvert the principle that the constitution is to be considered, in court, as a paramount law, are reduced to the necessity of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the constitution, and see only the law. 

This doctrine would subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions. It would declare that an act, which, according to the principles and theory of our government, is entirely void, is yet, in practice, completely obligatory. It would declare, that if the legislature shall do what is expressly forbidden, such act, notwithstanding the express prohibition, is in reality effectual. It would be giving to the legislature a practical and real omnipotence with the same breath which professes to restrict their powers within narrow limits. It is prescribing limits, and declaring that those limits may be passed at pleasure. 

That it thus reduces to nothing what we have deemed the greatest improvement on political institutions-a written constitution, would of itself be sufficient, in America where written constitutions have been viewed with so much reverence, for rejecting the construction. But the peculiar expressions of the constitution of the United States furnish additional arguments in favour of its rejection. 

The judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising under the constitution. [5 U.S. 137, 179]   Could it be the intention of those who gave this power, to say that, in using it, the constitution should not be looked into? That a case arising under the constitution should be decided without examining the instrument under which it arises? 

This is too extravagant to be maintained. 

In some cases then, the constitution must be looked into by the judges. And if they can open it at all, what part of it are they forbidden to read, or to obey? 

There are many other parts of the constitution which serve to illustrate this subject. 

It is declared that 'no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.' Suppose a duty on the export of cotton, of tobacco, or of flour; and a suit instituted to recover it. Ought judgment to be rendered in such a case? ought the judges to close their eyes on the constitution, and only see the law. 

The constitution declares that 'no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.' 

If, however, such a bill should be passed and a person should be prosecuted under it, must the court condemn to death those victims whom the constitution endeavours to preserve? 

'No person,' says the constitution, 'shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.' 
Here the language of the constitution is addressed especially to the courts. It prescribes, directly for them, a rule of evidence not to be departed from. If the legislature should change that rule, and declare one witness, or a confession out of court, sufficient for conviction, must the constitutional principle yield to the legislative act? 

From these and many other selections which might be made, it is apparent, that the framers of the consti- [5 U.S. 137, 180]   tution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of courts, as well as of the legislature. 

Why otherwise does it direct the judges to take an oath to support it? This oath certainly applies, in an especial manner, to their conduct in their official character. How immoral to impose it on them, if they were to be used as the instruments, and the knowing instruments, for violating what they swear to support! 

The oath of office, too, imposed by the legislature, is completely demonstrative of the legislative opinion on this subject. It is in these words: 'I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich; and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge all the duties incumbent on me as according to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably to the constitution and laws of the United States.' 

Why does a judge swear to discharge his duties agreeably to the constitution of the United States, if that constitution forms no rule for his government? if it is closed upon him and cannot be inspected by him. 

If such be the real state of things, this is worse than solemn mockery. To prescribe, or to take this oath, becomes equally a crime. 

It is also not entirely unworthy of observation, that in declaring what shall be the supreme law of the land, the constitution itself is first mentioned; and not the laws of the United States generally, but those only which shall be made in pursuance of the constitution, have that rank. 

Thus, the particular phraseology of the constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument. 

The rule must be discharged.

      <text xml:space="preserve"> __NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;The experts each say that one thing causes stuttering. They don't agree what that one thing is, but they all insist that their one thing is the only thing that causes stuttering. And each insists that his therapy program is the only effective treatment for stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at least six factors contribute to stuttering. No single stuttering therapy is a &amp;quot;miracle cure.&amp;quot; Treating stuttering requires a &lt;i&gt;multifactoral&lt;/i&gt; approach&amp;#151;different treatments for each of the six factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Developmental Disorder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering is a developmental disorder. In other words, if you're an adult stutterer, the primary reason that you stutter is that you stuttered as a child. That may seem obvious, but the implications are important, as you'll see in the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Childhood Stuttering|Childhood Stuttering]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Auditory Processing Underactivity&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Brain scans have found that the auditory processing area is underactive during stuttering. It appears that stutterers can't integrate what we hear ourselves saying with how we feel our muscles moving. Electronic &lt;i&gt;altered auditory feedback&lt;/i&gt; devices appear to correct this neurological abnormality. This factor is presented in the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Auditory Processing|Auditory Processing]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Speech Motor Control Overactivity&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Brain scans have also found that stutterers' speech motor (muscle) control area is overactive. Stutterers overtense their respiration (breathing); vocal folds; and lips, jaws, and tongues (articulators). These overtense muscles lock up or fail to coordinate, making speech impossible. &lt;i&gt;Fluency shaping therapy&lt;/i&gt; trains stutterers to speak with relaxed speech production muscles. This factor is presented in the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Speech Motor Learning and Control|Speech Motor Learning and Control]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Response Selection to Stress&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Most stutterers speak fluently when relaxed, but stutter under stress. &lt;i&gt;Personal construct therapy&lt;/i&gt; trains stutterers to handle stress in ways that result in fluent speech. This factor is presented in the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Response Selection Under Stress|Response Selection Under Stress]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Genes and Neurotransmitter&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Another neurological abnormality associated with stuttering involves too-high levels of the neurotransmitter &lt;i&gt;dopamine&lt;/i&gt; in the left caudate nucleus speech motor control area. This appears to contribute to speech motor (muscle) overactivity. &lt;i&gt;Dopamine antagonist medications&lt;/i&gt; treat this abnormality. This factor is presented in the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Genes and Neurotransmitters|Genes and Neurotransmitters]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Psychological Effects&lt;/h2&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering causes psychological fears and anxieties. For some individuals, these fears and anxieties are more disabling than their physical stuttering. Some individuals use stuttering as an excuse for deeper problems, such as inability to maintain relationships. Some individuals obsessively try to hide their stuttering, e.g., counterproductively refusing to go to speech therapy for fear that someone may see them entering the speech clinic. These individuals may need treatment with a psychologist in addition to speech therapy. This factor is presented in the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Psychological Issues|Psychological Issues]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Multifactoral Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most stutterers have one or two factors strongly. The other factors may be less significant. You might find a speech clinic that treats you successfully, especially if the speech clinic combines two or more therapies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a speech-language pathologist can treat at most three of the six factors. Electronic devices can treat one or two factors. Medications treat one factor. You may have to go to see several speech-language pathologists, and possibly buy an electronic device or get a medication prescription, to treat all of the factors that contribute to your stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Additional Factors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt that additional stuttering factors will be discovered. Likely other genes contribute to stuttering. The neurotransmitter &lt;font color=black&gt;acetylcholine&lt;/font color&gt; might play a role.{{ref|Harkness2005}}&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Some advances in stuttering will be treatments for co-existing conditions. In the future children (and adults) will be tested for a variety of disorders, and treatment designed accordingly. E.g., a child with stuttering and phonological dysfunction will be treated differently than a child with stuttering and ADHD. An adult with stuttering and social phobia will be treated differently from an outgoing mentally retarded adult who stutters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;References&lt;/h3&gt;

# {{note|Harkness2005}} Pharmacist and stutterer Richard Harkness believes: &amp;quot;My long-held hunch, based on my understanding of Parkinson's disease, is that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Ach) might be a key player in stuttering. Parkinson's disease is commonly described as a condition of relative imbalance between dopamine (DA) and Ach (low DA/high Ach). Hypothetically at this point, stuttering might be thought of as just the opposite (high DA/low Ach). Research in schizophrenia indicates that a decrease in striatal DA levels is accompanied by an increase in Ach levels. Thus, the tx condition brought about by D2 inhibitors (antipsychotics)&amp;#151;less dopaminergic activity&amp;#151;might result in a relative increase in Ach activity&amp;#151;in effect, could it be that antipsychotic-induced fluency improvement is actually due to increased Ach activity? One problem is that current Ach agonists tend to cause intolerable side effects. But there is ongoing research on Ach agonists/antagonists, primarily for drugs aimed at schizophrenia. There's much more to be learned.&amp;quot;

==Epidemiology==
*Incidence 0.4/100,000 in 2001 (up from 0.1/100,000 in 1986)
*Stage (SEER data, 1973-2002)
**Stage I: 55%
**Stage II: 31%
**Stage III: 6%
*Median survival: 4 years

*Incidence of cancer linked to Merkel cell polyomavirus. Virus DNA detected in 75% to 80% of Merkel Cell carcinoma specimens.

==Pathology==
*Cutaneous malignancy of neuroendocrine origin
*Initially described in 1972 as &quot;trabecular carcinoma&quot;
*Nomenclature changed to MCC due to structural and IHC similarities to Merkel cells
*Merkel cells were initially described as non-dendritic, non-keratinocyte epidermal cells that function as tactile skin receptors


==Overview==
*High rate of local failure and regional recurrence (50-80%)
*Considered highly radiosensitive
*Management is controversial; surgery tends to be mainstay, with some investigators suggesting margins of 3cm 
*Role of adjuvant RT is not well defined. However, a recent retrospective SEER analysis shows a significant survival benefit for all patients, and particularly for tumors &gt;2cm
*Only one prospective trial has been conducted to date (TROG 96:07), which suggests a benefit for concurrent chemo-RT in N+ patients

==Staging==
'''AJCC 7th Edition (2009)''' &lt;br&gt;
''Note:'' This is a new staging system for MCC beginning with the 7th Edition. In previous versions, was included in [[Radiation Oncology/Skin/Nonmelanoma#Staging|non-melanoma skin cancer staging]]. &lt;br&gt;
''Excludes:'' MCC of the eyelid

''Primary Tumor:''
*T0 - no evidence of primary tumor
*Tis - in situ
*T1 - tumor &lt;= 2 cm
*T2 - &gt;2 cm and &lt;= 5 cm
*T3 - &gt; 5 cm
*T4 - invades bone, muscle, fascia, or cartilage

''Regional Lymph Nodes:''
*N0 - none
*N1 
**N1a - micrometastasis
**N1b - macrometastasis
*N2 - in transit metastasis
*:defined as a tumor distinct from the primary tumor and either 1) between the primary and the nodal basin or 2) distal to the primary

''Distant Metastases:''
*M0 - none
*M1
**M1a - metastasis to skin, subcutaneous tissues, or distant lymph nodes
**M1b - metastasis to lung
**M1c - metastasis to all other visceral sites

''Stage Grouping:''
*IA - T1 pN0
*IB - T1 cN0
*IIA - T2-3 pN0
*IIB - T2-3 cN0
*IIC - T4 N0
*IIIA - N1a
*IIIB - N1b or N2
*IV - M1

''Note:'' prognostically, pN0 is better than cN0 (without pathologically confirmed node negativity) and thus pN0 vs cN0 is incorporated into overall staging, as is N1a vs N1b

===Older staging systems===
'''AJCC 6th Edition (2002)''' &lt;br&gt;
Was staged as a [[Radiation Oncology/Skin/Nonmelanoma#Staging|Non-melanoma skin cancer]]

==Lymph Node Assessment==
*'''Michigan'''
**95 pts undergoing SLN biopsy for MCC.
**'''2011:''' PMID 21300936 -- &quot;Features Predicting Sentinel Lymph Node Positivity in Merkel Cell Carcinoma.&quot; (Schwartz JL, J Clin Oncol. 2011 Mar 10;29(6):1036-1041.)
***SLN identified in 93 of 97 primary tumors. SLN + associated with increasing clinical size, tumor thickness, mitotic rate, and infiltrative tumor growth pattern.
***Conclusion: no subgroup of patients could be identified who had a &lt; 15-20% likelihood of positive LN. SLN biopsy should be recommended in pts with localized disease.

==Postoperative RT==
*'''SEER, 2007''' (1973-2002) PMID 17369567 -- &quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy is associated with improved survival in merkel cell carcinoma of the skin.&quot; (Mojica P, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Mar 20;25(9):1043-7.)
**Retrospective. 1665 patients in SEER registry. Surgery in 89% cases, adjuvant RT 40%. Median F/U 40 months
**Median survival: 49 months (surgery only 45 months vs. adjuvant RT 63 months)
**RT benefit: for all patients, but highly significant if tumor size &gt;2 cm (median OS 21 vs. 50 months). For tumors &lt;1cm (48 months vs. 93 months), for tumors 1-2cm (52 months vs. 86 months)
**Conclusion: &quot;The use of adjuvant radiation therapy is associated with improved survival in patients with MCC.&quot;
**Comment &amp; author reply: PMID 17906216 

*'''Sydney; 2007''' (Australia)(1992-2004) PMID 17356954 -- &quot;Merkel cell carcinoma: assessing the effect of wide local excision, lymph node dissection, and radiotherapy on recurrence and survival in early-stage disease--results from a review of 82 consecutive cases diagnosed between 1992 and 2004.&quot; (Jabbour J, Ann Surg Oncol. 2007 Jun;14(6):1943-52.)
**Retrospective. 82 patients with early-stage
**Outcome: Recurrence rate 51%, 
**Predictors: LN+ status negative, lymphadenectomy prolonged DFS (28 months vs. 12 months, SS) but not OS. SM- not associated with better outcome. RT in 58%, improved DFS (24 months vs. 12 months); improved OS for both primary site (54 months vs. 46 months) and N+ (103 months vs. 34 months)
**Conclusion: Adjuvant RT recommended for early-stage disease; involved regional LN should be treated

*'''Brown University; 2006''' PMID 16785371 -- &quot;Adjuvant local irradiation for Merkel cell carcinoma.&quot; (Lewis KG, Arch Dermatol. 2006 Jun;142(6):693-700.)
**Literature survey. 333 reports published between 1966-2004 reviewed
**Outcome: With RT, local recurrence reduced HR 0.27 (SS); regional recurrence reduced HR 0.34 (SS). 1-year OS 87%, 5-year OS 49%; 1-year CSS 90%, 5-year CSS 62%. No difference in CSS or OS with RT, though if single patient case reports excluded, found CSS benefit (p=0.04) and OS benefit (p=0.02) for adjuvant RT
**Conclusion: Surgery plus local adjuvant RT associated with lower local and regional recurrence

*'''Cologne; 2002''' (1990-2000) PMID 11823697 -- &quot;Role of postoperative radiotherapy in the management of Merkel cell carcinoma.&quot; (Eich HT, Am J Clin Oncol. 2002 Feb;25(1):50-6.)
**Retrospective. 31 patients, 13 H&amp;N, 13 limbs, 5 trunk. Stage I 26, Stage II 4, Stage III 1. Surgery alone 14/31, adjuvant RT 16/31, definitive RT 1/31
**Outcome: median OS 2.7 years; local recurrence 20%, regional LN mets 30%, DM 23%. RT decreased locoregional reccurence from 36% to 6%
**Negative predictive factors: H&amp;N location, lack of post-op RT
**Conclusion: Post-op RT to primary tumor and regional lymphatics effective

*'''MD Anderson; 2001''' (1945-95) - PMID 11177031 &amp;mdash; &quot;Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck: effect of surgical excision and radiation on recurrence and survival.&quot; Gillenwater AM et al. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2001 Feb;127(2):149-54.
**Retrospective. 66 pts. No difference in local relapse for surgical margins &lt;1 vs 1-2cm vs &gt;2cm. Improved local recurrence (12% vs 44%) and regional recurrence (27% vs 85%) rate for addition of RT. No difference in OS. Distant disease developed in 36% of pts regardless of treatment.

*'''Queensland Radium Institute; 1995''' (1981-91) - PMID 7836086 &amp;mdash; &quot;The importance of postoperative radiation therapy in the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma.&quot; Meeuwissen JA et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1995 Jan 15;31(2):325-31. 
**Retrospective. 80 pts. 38 of 38 pts treated with surgery alone relapsed, versus 10 of 34 pts with S+RT.

==Chemotherapy + RT==
*'''Queensland Radium Institute / TROG; 2006''' PMID 16125873 &amp;mdash; &quot;Does chemotherapy improve survival in high-risk stage I and II Merkel cell carcinoma of the skin?&quot; Poulsen MG et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Jan 1;64(1):114-9.
**Retrospective. Compared 53 pts from TROG 96:07 (chemo + RT) to 144 pts treated at Queensland from 1988-96 (RT only).
**Chemotherapy does not improve survival.

*'''TROG 96:07''' (1996-2001)
**Phase II. Pts with disease limited to the primary and nodes with at least 1 risk factor: recurrence after initial therapy, involved nodes, size &gt; 1 cm, gross residual disease, or occult primary with nodes. N+ in 62%. 50 Gy in 25 fx with concurrent carboplatin/etoposide on days 1-3 on weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10.

Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Sep 1;51(1):156-63. Median F/U 1.8 years
***Toxicity: Grade 3-4 skin 63%; neutropenia 40%
***Conclusion: Toxicity acceptable. No outcome measures reported
**'''2003''' PMID 14645427 -- &quot;High-risk Merkel cell carcinoma of the skin treated with synchronous carboplatin/etoposide and radiation: a Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group Study--TROG 96:07.&quot; (Poulsen M, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Dec 1;21(23):4371-6.). Median F/U 4 years
***3-year outcome: OS 76%, LR control 75%, DM control 76%
***Conclusion: Addition of chemo to RT resulted in high control

How effective is stuttering therapy?

&lt;p&gt;The best study I've seen found that a three-week intensive fluency shaping therapy program reduced stuttering from 15-20% stuttered syllables to 1-2% stuttered syllables. 12 to 24 months after therapy, about 70% of the stutterers had satisfactory fluency. About 5% were marginally successful. About 25% had unsatisfactory fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of another fluency shaping stuttering therapy program, about 95% of stutterers were &amp;quot;very satisfied&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;satisfied&amp;quot; with their speech. A year later, their satisfaction dropped to 43%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only published study of stuttering modification therapy found that the program &amp;quot;&amp;#133;appears to be ineffective in producing durable improvements in stuttering behaviors.&amp;quot;  But experts touted the therapy as &amp;quot;one of the finest programs in the country.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large study of children who stutter compared therapy with a speech-language pathologist, to therapy with parents who were trained by a speech-language pathologist, to therapy with computers. The computers produced the best long-term results (about 60% effective), the parents second-best (about 50% effective), and the speech-language pathologists worst (about 30% effective).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nine adult stutterers used my company's delayed auditory feedback (DAF) anti-stuttering devices thirty minutes per day for three months. The subjects received no therapy from speech-language pathologists. Three months later the subjects' speech had improved more than 50%, when they weren't using the devices (see [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Auditory Processing/Altered Auditory Feedback#Long-Term Effects of DAF|Long-Term Effects of DAF]]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about these studies in the chapter [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Long-Term Studies of Stuttering Therapy|Long-Term Studies of Stuttering Therapy]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion I infer from these studies is that stuttering therapy shouldn't center on the speech-language pathologist. Don't go to a speech clinic with an attitude like you're taking your car to a shop to get repaired. A speech-language pathologist isn't going to fix you (or your child) while you passively wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering therapy should center on you, the stutterer. Stuttering therapy is more like taking your car to a shop where a mechanic teaches you to diagnosis and fix problems, and loans you tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your car will likely run well in the shop or driving on a quiet, smooth street. But sometimes you'll have to drive on rocky, mountain roads or on a high-speed racetrack, where you're likely to break down. Your mechanic won't be there. Only your training and your tools will keep you on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some drivers need a Hummer for four-wheel drive roads. Other drivers need a Corvette for racetracks. Some mechanics need the latest computers and electronics in their toolboxes. Other mechanics can fix anything with just a screwdriver and a monkey wrench.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering therapy can fail because you selected the wrong mechanic for your needs, who gives you the wrong tools. Or you can find the right mechanic, with the right tools, but you let the mechanic do all the work, and you leave the tools at the shop. This book will guide you to find the speech-language pathologist(s) and the tools you need, and also help you keep your wheels turning on the rough roads away from the speech clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">IB Music scores, like other subject scores, are divided into several components. These components and their weights differ between the Standard Level and Higher Level of examination. 

==Standard Level==

The Standard Level examination consists of an External Assessment and an Internal Assessment portion. 

===External Assessment===

The External Assessment portion is '''50%''' of the overall score. It consists of the:

*[[/Listening Paper|Listening Paper]] - '''30%''' of the overall score
*[[/Investigation|Musical Investigation]] - '''20%''' of the overall score

===Internal Assessment===

The Internal Assessment portion is '''50%''' of the overall score. It consists of a choice of:

*[[/SL Solo Performance|Solo Performance]]
*[[/SL Group Performance|Group Performance]]
*[[/SL Composition|Composition]]

==Higher Level==

The Higher Level examination consists of an External Assessment and an Internal Assessment portion.

===External Assessment===

The External Assessment portion is '''50%''' of the overall score. It consists of the:

*[[/Listening Paper|Listening Paper]] - '''30%''' of the overall score
*[[/Investigation|Musical Investigation]] - '''20%''' of the overall score

===Internal Assessment===

The Internal Assessment portion is '''50%''' of the overall score. It consists of:

*[[/HL Solo Performance|Solo Performance]] - '''25%''' of the overall score
*[[/HL Composition|Composition]] - 25% of the overall score

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Should Wikibooks include game guides? ==
After recent activity at [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], I think that we need a discussion page for whether to incluude game manuals/guides at Wikibooks. I have posted links to this page from [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks]], [[Wikibooks:Community Portal]], the staff lounge, and the obscure [[Wikibooks talk:Policy/Vote]].

I encourage discussion about game guide inclusion/exclusion to appear on this one page. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:20, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:I personally am split on the issue. On one hand, game manuals can be instructional, intersting to read, and at the same time not violate any other wikibooks policy, besides the &quot;not a textbook&quot; clause. On the other hand, these are definately not textbooks, and there are a million and one other sites on the internet with information about videogames. Many VG websites even allow users to post new information (although none of the other ones benefit from wikimedia software).  I am inclined to say that game manuals should probably be moved to wikicities, although i am very indecisive on this point. At greater stake here is whether wikibooks should include ''any manuals'' for any software, game or otherwise. I definately say that wikibooks should allow for usage manuals for software (&quot;how to use X&quot;, for example) in general. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

::Before we start this discussion fully, shouldn't we establish if Wikibooks is just for textbooks? We need to hear back from Jimmy Wales or some other Wikimedia founders about What the purpose of Wikibooks is. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:13, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:I think the current incarnation of [[WB:WIW]] seems to show that it is only for textbooks. This then limits things for which there is an &quot;existing class&quot; for the texbook to be used in. There are classes on videogame design, but no classes on videogame strategy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:56, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:::We don't need Jimbo to explain every detail in this decision.  What has happened is that Jimbo has declared a few Wikibooks as having gone too far, and we can take one of two approaches to this decision:

:::# Protest Jimbo publicly and denouce his decision as very arbitrary.  It is very arbitrary even if '''he''' thinks that from his understanding of why Wikibooks was created that these books should not belong here.
:::# Accept this decision by Jimbo and try to make new policies that would exclude not only these books that he specifically named, but similar books like them in the future.

:::I am strongly suggesting we as a Wikibooks community try to take this second approach instead of the first.  That is why I feel we need to make some significant policy changes on Wikibooks.

:::I personnally like the game guides on Wikibooks, and it is very clearly in their own little space on Wikibooks anyway as a seperate bookshelf.  The only real justification to removing gaming guides is that it takes up server space and bandwidth for Wikimedia projects that could somehow otherwise be used for more &quot;legitimate&quot; Wikibooks.  A very substantially lesser argument would be that it somehow &quot;cheapens&quot; Wikibooks to become a vanity press.  I think that is a problem elsewhere for Wikibooks anyway on other issues, but could be used.  The one final reason (and very cynical in this matter) is that Jimbo wants to move large amounts of content to Wikicities so he can get wealthy off of the ad links that Wikicities has but Wikimedia projects don't have.

:::I want to be on record as saying I don't think that is Jimbo's motivation to increase content on Wikicities, but it still is going to be a side effect and regardless is a conflict of interest here.

:::As far as &quot;raising the bar&quot; and more strongly encouraging that game guides be more academically focused, that is something that could happen as well.  I just don't want to see something like a Wikibooks equivalent of &quot;The Gods must be Crazy&quot;.  In South Africa, it was illegal for some bizzare reason to make documentaries about native African peoples during the Aparteid era.  That movie instead included this very thin story about a Coke bottle having to be returned to &quot;the Gods&quot;, even though it wasn't really needed.  I'm hoping that thinly disguised Wikibooks don't happen in order to circumvent arbitrary policies like trying to get rid of game guides here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:06, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

::::There's also approach number 3-  ask Jimbo to explain exactly what he wants and why he thinks the way he does.  Thats what I think we ought to do-  I think if Jimbo wants these gone, he needs to explain why and how it will help wikibooks to limit its direction like that.  Its not disk space and bandwidth-  these are really minor compared to the total space/bandwidth of the project.  I don't think its him wanting to become rich either-  its him thinking wikibooks should be something other than it has become, and I think that difference needs to be discussed, not pushed from above.  Pushing major changes like that is something that can kill a project from lost contributors.  Besides, you never know-  we may have the right of it and convince him

::::Beyond that, I think deleting/moving these would have serious negative side effects.  These guides bring in readers.  Readers become contributors.  Remove them, and we'll have less incoming traffic resulting in slower wikibooks growth.  Even worse, we would probably lose many of the people who wrote the guides.  Noone likes to see their work going unappreciated.  I see nothing but harm in deleting them.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 17:37, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:If i recall correctly, I dont think jimbo specificaly mentioned the game guides as potential targets of the &quot;clean house&quot;. Maybe he did, but if he didnt, we should definately ask. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:41, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

::Once again let me say, I have asked Jimbo on his en: page and am waiting to hear back. And guess what, if we lose contributors, it will be a sad thing, but if they can't seem to work within the purpose and structure of Wikibooks, that is not ''our'' problem. Not everyone will always be happy. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:13, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:::The problem is that they have been working within the ''purpose and structure of Wikibooks'' so far.  With a few exceptions where we already have removed content from Wikibooks and enforced policies, these other Wikibooks have been allowed to remain.  Especially [[Jokebook]], which Jimbo doesn't want to allow anymore.  We are talking about the removal of a huge portion of Wikibooks and hundreds of modules, together with the contributors who added that content, especially if we can come up with a consistant policy besides &quot;Jimbo doesn't want this here anymore&quot;.  Where it becomes '''''our''''' problem is that Wikibooks becomes a much smaller place, and we will have a huge group of disaffected users who complain about the arbitrary manner in how this action has taken place.  Jimbo's comment about blocking [[User:Zondor]] from Wikibooks is especially disturbing, as this user seems to otherwise be a productive contributor to Wikibooks.  I don't want to see this user leave because of a personal beef that Jimbo seems to have against him.  Zondor, BTW, was the one contributor to [[White Heritage Security]] that was a registered user, and to whom Jimbo comment about automatically blocking due to his adding this Wikibook would have applied.  In this case I think it was a very poor comment and that this user has proven himself as a worthy contributor here.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:50, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:::::Please let me quote sometihng that Zondor wrote: &quot;Whites may need to create a separate nation to defend themselves from racial destruction by racial mixing.&quot;  I'm sorry but in my book that isn't a slightly debatable remark that might lead me to have a &quot;personal beef&quot; against him -- it's vandalism, trolling.  If he '''also''' did some good work, in addition to posting a racist tract, fine, but that doesn't mean we need him around.  Period.

:::::We have the opportunity to get major funding and support for Wikibooks.  This could easily mean paid fulltime jobs for some existing Wikibooks contributors to help nurture and grow the project at a much faster pace than we've been able to manage to date.  We will not get that funding if we have embarassing silly stuff on the site.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 09:54, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

::But they really weren't working within the purpose ans structure of Wikibooks. From the beginning, Jokebook and the like (read: not a textbook) should have been deleted. Just because in the beginning some Admins didn't enforce policy is not a good reason to ''not'' enforce it now. If we had had a section where people could come in and write whatever they wanted, &quot;Jimbo sux&quot;, &quot;I hate Wikibooks&quot;, or &quot;Robert Horning is a retard&quot;, and no one deleted it or said anything, and say it grew to be 200 modules. Should we just allow it because no one ever said anything? That is basically what happened. WB was set up for textbooks. Not &quot;non-fiction books&quot;. Letting things like Jokebook slide should never have happened. And since I am not aware of the full Zondor episode, I won't comment on that. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:00, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:As a registered, well-known, respected user, Zondor should have known that something blantantly racist, POV, and soap-boxish should never have been on wikibooks in the first place, much less being actively contributed to and defended. If you go into a community like this, and contribute to something so out-of-the-ballpark, and so hateful, you can be sure you are going to catch some shit. Zondor should have known better, and while i don't completely think he should be banned over the ordeal, if jimbo decides to kick him out, I won't fight that decision at all. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:42, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

::::::Rob's choices are between two wild extremes and are not exhaustive in the way that he portrays.  Another choice, for example, is to wait for Jimbo to delete the ''three specific books'' that he said he was going to delete, to take Jimbo's very clear statement that ''existing policy precludes them'' at its face value, and everyone to stop running around like headless chickens saying that we suddenly need to make up new policies. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 04:42, 23 November 2005 (UTC)
:::::::The point is, I think, that Jimbo's suddenly come in with all these &quot;must be a textbook&quot;-esque reaffirmations, and they are sweeping. He said something like &quot;there may be others&quot;, but I doubt he's going to stop at the handful he came across. He's trying to reaffirm Wikibooks' original vision, and we need to either follow along with that and transwiki a crapload of stuff, or else take the just as difficult route of opposing him and arguing the case for why non-classroom books should be allowed.

::::::Jimbo named three specific books, no more.  The wildly extreme ideas that there is a sweeping change afoot, that &quot;the removal of a huge portion of Wikibooks and hundreds of modules&quot; is required, and that we &quot;need to transwiki a crapload of stuff&quot; have no actual foundation in anything Jimbo has just written or done.  The only moderate idea from recent discussion that has any foundation is the idea that ''this'' page is here to discuss, namely that game manuals might not fit within an &quot;instructional and educational texts&quot; remit.  But it was ''another'' editor ([[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]) who brought that up, not Jimbo.  Similarly, ''prior'' to Jimbo writing anything it was ''other'' editors who questioned the inclusion of [[w:coffee table book|coffee table book]]s such as [[366 Photographs on the Beach]], and books that are solely soapboxes for promoting novel and original ideas such as [[Triangular Earth Calendar]] and [[Qrai]].

== Definition of textbook and class ==
*[[Wiktionary:textbook]] (yet to exist)
*[[Wiktionary:class]]

LV asked, ''is Wikibooks only for textbooks?'' I thought that &quot;textbook&quot; only means book of text. I usually understood it to mean &quot;instructional text&quot;, then Wikibooks would include guides that instruct in video game strategy. Wikibooks could still ban such guides; it already bans textbooks such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, and works of fiction. See [[WB:WIW]].

Also, if &quot;class&quot; is in the K-12 and university context, then [[WB:WIW]] (&quot;usable in an existing class&quot;) must be edited to indicate this context. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:28, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

At Wiktionary, I added &quot;textbook&quot; to the requested entries. Meanwhile, one can use [http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=textbook textbook at dict.org]. Webster 1913: &quot;any manual of instruction&quot;. WordNet is more strict; it requires that the book be prepared for schools and colleges, but that is not the only target audience of this wiki. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:02, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

:I think one of Jimbo's comments is in order here.  As he puts it, &quot;In legitimate, accredited cooking schools, cookbooks are textbooks.  I see no reason why a cookbook should not be considered a textbook in this context.&quot;

:Another comment from another contributor on Foundation-l &quot;I tend to interpret the role of Wikibooks very broadly, certainly to go beyond the idea of the classical textbook.  In some ways the classical textbook is antithetical to good education because it tends to mould its users into the same series of learning experiences.  A single Wikibook should begin with a subject that can be included in Wikipedia but which requires expansion into a book that in theory could be published as a stand alone entity.  The Cookbook was a good example of this.  There was a great debate at one time about the inclusion of recipes in Wikipedia.  Some were accepted as proper to Wikipedia, but the bulk ended up in Wikibooks where NPOV could also be approached with a more relaxed interpretation.&quot;

:And another on the same mailing list about game guides &quot;Since I'm peripherally involved with a Game Studies PhD program (not my field, but I work with people who are in it), I thought I would point out that what constitutes a &quot;textbook&quot; is not very narrowly defined.  Who decided Wikibooks was for textbooks anyway?  This was never the intent.&quot;

:Certainly using this distinction is not going to help us out much except to cull some minor cruft.  Just about any book-length content could be loosely defined as textbook material, even content that is purely fictional in nature  If, on the other hand, we adopt a strict definition of a textbook here, it has the potential of culling a major portion of this project, including items that would be benificial from an educational viewpoint.

:I want to point out that the reason we ban encyclopedias and dictionaries is because there are other Wikimedia projects that deal with this type of content and it is better to have the content there than here.  As for fiction, I think that should be another Wikimedia project, instead of Wikicities, but that is another discussion elsewhere, not here, and the Fiction Wikicity is a very healthy and active project.  Let's not get confused with removing content that is better hosted elsewhere due to specalists working with that content better and removing content due to its offensive nature like [[White Heriatage Society]] and [[Naturism]].

:If we define Wikibooks as just for textbooks, I hope that definition can include educational teaching materials like [[Jokebook]] and [[Cookbook]] that can indeed be used for learning but don't necessarily fit the standard view of what you would buy in a college bookstore for a specific course.  Then again, I've seen examples of both of these as required reading for some classes, and other materials that would be culled from Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:40, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

:::Jimbo says, &quot;This is for textbooks, not joke books, '''not random books on any subject you like'''.

Stop with the snide comments (amusingly ironic from someone who is pushing a &quot;no personal attacks&quot; policy).  If you want to push that to become policy, do so legitamately instead of using the big lie approach (repeat something enough and people will believe its true).

:: Game guides are just another kind of [[Wikibooks:Computing_bookshelf | Computer Guide]], you could even say Game guides arer a subset of computer guides :) Technically, they aren't textbooks but computer guides, and usually there aren't classes for them (There is no class to learn how to [[Installing Linux]]).

== What game guides have to offer to Wikibooks ==

Consistant with my reccomendation at [[Wikibooks_talk:What_is_Wikibooks#Lets focus on the important aspects of the debate | What is Wikibooks]], I might as well state what I consider the important parts of this debate: What Game guides have to offer to wikibooks.

*Publicity/Gateway -- Yes, I came here for textbooks, but I became an active editor because of video game guides (check my contributions)
*Sub-Sandbox material-- In all honesty, I would have never touched a textbook outside of a video game guide. Creation of a video game guide would teach wikibookians how to create a guide with a very low &quot;risk&quot;. Giving wrong info in a video game guide is not that big of a problem. Giving wrong info in a full blown college textbook... is something to fear for newbie editors.
*Fun for the kids-- Wikijunior books would be great if they got more kids involved. What could be better than a kid telling his friends about a video game guide, and then them comming in and finding the wikijunior section?
*Attracting the people with time on their hands-- People who read and create game guides have more time on their hands than others... Those are the kinds of people who potentially can do the most good.

To be fair, I'll list what I know as what removing the game bookshelf and video games bookshelf has to offer

* Higher prestige -- It looks more educational to have no games all serious talk. However, i feel like this would isolate more common contributors.
* Bandwith -- Save some money, space, server time?
* Distraction to wikijunior section -- Kids would rather spend their time on &quot;fun stuff&quot; than on the books? IMO, any webpage would be a distraction... but whatever

Well, I'm for video games here so what do you expect :-p Maybe an official pro/con section should be placed up.
--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 11:29, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

:OK, I tried to create pro and con sections at [[Wikibooks:Game manual guidelines]]. Everyone go edit and contribute! --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:49, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

:Okay, let's be honest here: we could save ''all the bandwidth'' if we just shut wikibooks down completely. If money and bandwidth concerns are being raised, then people aren't understanding the whole wikimedia project in general. and the &quot;Distraction to wikijunior section&quot;? I would love to see a number on how many children are actually reading wikijunior books. Especially since policy states that even wikijunior isn't explicitly censored for minors. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 15:05, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

:: My point exactly :) I don't realy see a problem with it, but I attempted to show the other side :-/ I'm sure there is an argument, but I'm just not seeing it. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 16:22, 4 December 2005 (UTC)

== If game guides are moved to Gameinfo ==

I started the [[Wikicities:c:Gameinfo:Guide:Battle for Wesnoth]], which I originally intended to start at this wiki. This is the first time that I started a game guide at any wiki. Though I support the retention of game guides at this wiki, using Gameinfo allows me to create a guide without worrying about &quot;neutral point of view&quot; and &quot;no original work&quot; (at least not yet) and also allows me to post a review of the game (which I will do later).

Thus, I have enough familiarity with Gameinfo to provide these comments about a scenario where most game guides from Wikibooks move to Gameinfo.
* Gameinfo currently has subpages disabled in the &quot;Guide:&quot; namespace. Some books ([[NetHack]]) use this feature, which allows &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/links/]], [[../links/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and automatic links upward. This would be a matter finding someone to enable the subpages feature.
* Gameinfo cannot use images on Wikimedia Commons with &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:...]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. So when someone moves a guide, all images must be uploaded again, even if those images are on Commons.
* Gameinfo currently has only a handful of administrators, plus the central Wikicities administrators (who are responsible to every wiki hosted at Wikicities). It is much smaller than our [[Wikibooks:computer and video games bookshelf|computer and video games bookshelf]], so the wiki could easily be overwhelmed if it took most of the guides from here. Wikibooks users might not know that guides go in &quot;Guide:&quot; namespace or that they should create data pages in main namespace (example [[Wikicities:c:Gameinfo:NetHack]]) for each game.
* Gameinfo runs an old version of MediaWiki which does not support the [[Special:Import]] feature (see [[Wikicities:c:Gameinfo:Special:Import]]), so guides cannot yet be moved by the easy way.

So, hosting these games at Gameinfo is probably possible, if risky and difficult. I currently prefer that Wikibooks continue to allow game guides. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:54, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Fabiuccio. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Fabiuccio~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Danish adjectives are conjugated according to the gender and number of the nouns to which they apply. Each regular adjective has a base form, used for common gender nouns, a t-form used with neuter gender nouns, and an e-form used with plural nouns and in definite descriptions. In many cases, the t- and e- forms are created simply by attaching the letters to the end of the common gender form, but not always. Frequently the final vowel is doubled before adding -e, and occasionally the preceding vowel is affected in a manner similar to the plural of ''en bog'' being ''bøger'' or that of ''et barn'' being ''børn''.

Example:
En dejlig kage (a lovely cake)
Et dejligt hus (a lovely house)
Tre dejlige kager (three lovely cakes)
Den dejlige kage (the lovely cake)
Det dejlige hus (the lovely house)

One notable exception is ''lille'', which uses the same forms for both singular genders and becomes ''små'' for plurals.

Hi; I find it rather inelegant to keep on marking an equation as (x) and then having a piece of text after that explaining what the (x) means.  I'd suggest that there was a section somewhere in this book which explains the notation used and then we can get rid of all the repeats.  --Takkaria 11:44, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Synopsis ==
{{spoiler}}

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is once again enduring a dreadful summer with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]]. He is angry and frustrated that he has had little communication with either [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] or [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], and feeling isolated and cut off, is desperate for any information about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and the Wizarding world. One day, he hides in the Dursleys' flower bed under the living room window so he can overhear the Muggle news on TV. He is listening for any reports of unexplained events that, as a wizard, he would recognize as being caused by Dark magic. Hearing a cracking noise that he recognizes as someone [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Disapparating]], Harry jumps up, wand at the ready, but bumps his head on the window frame, giving away his presence. An argument ensues with Uncle Vernon, though the need to &quot;keep up appearances&quot; shortens it. Harry leaves, initially to investigate the noise, eventually ending up alone with his thoughts in a playground. He encounters [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Dudley]] with his motley friends in the park. Harry, knowing that Dudley fears his magical powers, restrains himself from taunting him. After Dudley's companions leave, he and Harry head back to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]]. As they reach an alley, it suddenly becomes dark and cold, and they are attacked by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]]. Harry repels the Dementors with a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus Charm]]. However, Dudley is chilled to the bone and later becomes nauseous. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arabella Figg|Mrs. Figg]] (Harry's neighbour) appears on the scene, and amazingly, she is not at all surprised to see Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|magic wand]], ordering him not to put it away.

== Analysis ==

Readers can see how lonely Harry is at his erstwhile relatives' home and how unhappy he has always been there. He is trapped inside a world in which he no longer belongs, nor wants to be part of, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] has apparently decreed that he must endure living there each summer. We do not yet know why, but at the previous book's conclusion, Ron says that Dumbledore had vetoed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]]'s invitation to have Harry spend the entire summer at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]]. The Dursleys again show how little they care for their nephew's needs. However, they do treat him better than they used to, and, as Dudley seems to, now fear Harry's magical powers. While Harry and the Dursleys' overall relationship remains unchanged, there has been a gradual power shift within the household, seen as far back as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|the first book]], when Harry was given Dudley's &quot;extra&quot; bedroom and no longer had to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs. While Harry would never use magic against his relatives, he knows they fear his increasing magical abilities and alliances with wizards, and this has progressively granted him some bargaining leverage. 

Harry is hungry for information about the Wizarding world he is being isolated from. In the previous book, he witnessed Voldemort's resurrection, and he knows, perhaps as no other excepting Dumbledore, how much evil has returned. However, it seems that Harry is deliberately being denied information, making him angry and frustrated. While [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] has been on a mission and is likely unable to write, it seems that Ron and Hermione are deliberately withholding important details from their letters, leaving Harry feeling abandoned.

Harry has been carefully watching for any signs of Voldemort's activity restarting, not only in the Wizarding realm, by means of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']], but in the Muggle world, which is why he listens to the Muggle news. Harry is aware that Voldemort considers Muggles unworthy of preservation. The Dementor attack may be a sign that Voldemort is becoming active, and it actually helps relieve Harry's anger and frustration by reestablishing his ties to the magical world. Discovering that batty old Mrs. Figg possesses knowledge about wizards delivers Harry a powerful shock, given the vacuum he is forced to stay in. There have been clues that Mrs. Figg is connected to the Wizarding world since the first book, such as the strange odors emanating from her kitchen and her unusual cats, though Harry was too young and inexperienced a wizard to have recognized them.

The attack also brings another character into focus: Dudley. Being a Muggle, he should have been unaware and largely unaffected by the Dementors' presence; however, he was obviously affected by them, just as they were able to detect him.

We note that Uncle Vernon yelped and let go of Harry, as if he was feeling some sort of pain. This is almost certainly unconscious use of magic on Harry's part, and probably should have resulted in another official reprimand, but the magic used may have been too small and too localized to register with the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] watchdog.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

=== Review ===
# How is Dudley affected by the Dementors?
# Why is Harry so intent on listening to the Muggle news?
# How has Harry's relationship with the Dursleys changed? What accounts for this?
# Why would Harry expect to hear news about the Wizarding world reported on Muggle TV?
# Why does Harry feel as though he is being ignored? Could there be a more logical reason behind the disappointing lack of responsiveness in his friends' letters? Is Harry overreacting, or does he have the right to feel deprived?

=== Further Study ===
# How does Mrs. Figg know about the Wizarding world?
# Why do letters from Harry's friends contain so little information about the Wizard world?
# Why would Dudley, a Muggle who should be unaware of a Dementor's presence, be so affected by them? Why would a Dementor attack him along with Harry?
# Who could have sent the Dementors to Privet Drive and why?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

The &quot;loud, echoing ''crack''&quot; that startles Harry is, as he had believed, the sound of someone Disapparating. We will find out that the wizard in question was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mundungus Fletcher|Mundungus Fletcher]], abandoning his job of watching over Harry in order to complete one of his shady deals. The cat Harry sees running off immediately after the sound is one of Ms. Figg's cats (actually at least part [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Kneazle|Kneazle]]) running to report Mundungus' departure.

Mrs. Figg's connection to the Wizarding world was mentioned at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 36|the end of the previous book]], though it is very carefully formed so as to not attract attention. We never know Mrs. Figg's first name, even the Dursleys call her &quot;old Mrs. Figg&quot;, and the complexity of her first name (Arabella) seems to be carefully selected so as to overshadow her last name when Dumbledore mentions it. We will find out that Mrs. Figg is an associate of Dumbledore's and a member of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|the Order of the Phoenix]] from Voldemort's first rise to power, and has been charged with watching over Harry since he was first left at Privet Drive.

Slightly connected to this is Dumbledore's insistence that Harry spend time at Privet Drive each summer. Dumbledore has set protective spells on Harry and the house, based on the protection given Harry when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother]] died to save him. That protection will only hold so long as Harry is sheltered by his mother's blood, which is to say as long as his home is the place where one of his mothers' close blood relatives lives. If he stops being able to call Privet Drive home, or reaches the age of majority, that protection will cease. Harry's returning each summer is sufficient to keep Privet Drive his home. While this is Harry's strongest protection, Dumbledore never has only one string to his bow, and has arranged for Harry to be watched and guarded by other means, including Mrs. Figg.

Harry is correct in his assumption that Ron and Hermione are deliberately withholding information in their letters. This is at Dumbledore's orders, though why Dumbledore wants Harry to remain unknowing is never fully explained. It is possible that, even at this early stage, Dumbledore worries that Voldemort may know about the linkage between Harry's mind and his own, and is trying to minimize the possible damage should Voldemort snoop in Harry's mind. Dumbledore is aware that, even before Voldemort re-embodied himself, there were two episodes where Harry apparently received clear images from Voldemort's mind. Dumbledore may also feel it is inappropriate for someone Harry's age to be involved in adult matters, even if it is related to Harry. And while Ron and Hermione are certainly not adults, they are in a position to overhear much of what is going on, and Dumbledore does not want them sharing that with Harry, particularly when he is so cut off from anyone who can discuss matters with him. Harry, of course, feels differently.

While it is never known exactly why Dementors were at Privet Drive, we do learn [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Dolores Umbridge]] sent them; she is introduced a little later in this book. Her only explanation for sending the Dementors is that, &quot;''something'' had to be done&quot;, though she remains mute on just why it had to be done, or why Dementors were the reasonable choice.

Dudley perhaps should have been affected much less by the Dementors than he was. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|chapter 1]] of ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', it is stated that Muggles are unable to see Dementors but can feel some of their effects, and [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19 the author has said] that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Squib|Squibs]] are also unable to see them, though we have reason to question that. (In particular, Mrs. Figg's first words in the next chapter, &quot;And now look! Dementors!&quot; make it clear that she recognizes the Dementors somehow, though whether by direct perception or by understanding of the effects is never made clear.) In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], it is mentioned that the Dementors are attacking people, but it is uncertain to what extent Muggles are being targeted or what effects they are feeling from the attacks. But we are led to believe that Dudley suffers from the Dementors more than expected; and it is interesting that the Dementors chose to target Dudley as well as Harry.

The whole issue of Dementors and their perception by non-magical folk (Muggles and Squibs) is questionable, despite pronouncements by the author. While the effects on Dudley are marked, possibly more than they would be on any other Muggle, there is no indication that he actually sees them, only that he is affected by them. His responses on being asked what happened center purely on the effects, nothing is said about their appearance. Mrs. Figg seems to be able to perceive that they were present, and her word choice seems to suggest that she was aware that there were two there &amp;ndash; she uses the plural when talking about them, even before Harry does. It seems to us that if Mrs. Figg could only perceive their effects, she would be unlikely to know that there were two present, unless she was able to see Harry's Patronus and guess, from the way it moved, that it was dealing with two attackers. We suspect, however, that whatever a Patronus is made up of (psychic emanations?) would be no more or less visible to Muggles than a Dementor would be. At the hearing, interestingly, Mrs. Figg describes the Dementors, not terribly accurately, and does describe the Patronus, quite completely, so we believe that she saw Harry, though Harry did not see her until later. We do suggest that if Mrs. Figg had been unable to see the Dementors, but could see the Patronus, she would not be so sure there was more than one Dementor; the Patronus could have been directed at one Dementor which dodged away overhead and behind, then directed to make a second, successful pass at the same Dementor. Because of this, despite the author's stating that Mrs. Figg could not see Dementors, we believe that her later testimony, and what she says in the next chapter, very strongly suggest that she saw at the very least the Dementors' cloaks. But we freely admit that this is only a suggestion, no matter how strong, and that it remains open to debate.

Dudley's being affected by the Dementors leads us to an interesting suggestion. According to Rowling, in an interview prior to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|the third book's publication]], [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/0399-barnesandnoble.html#magic a character, previously believed to be a Muggle] would develop magical abilities unexpectedly late in life (&quot;late&quot; meaning after age 11 or so), and [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=37 later, on her own site, she stated that it would not be Aunt Petunia]. Although this was expected to happen in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Rowling later decided to omit this from the storyline. However, if Dudley suffers the effects from the Dementors that we see in this chapter, it is possible that he was originally intended to be the character to which this would happen, despite Rowling's later statement that the ordinariness of Vernon's DNA would crush any incipient magic out of Dudley. In that event, Arabella Figg may have been the character Rowling intended to become magical. Like Dudley, she apparently also detected the Dementors presence when she should have been unable to, and her magical lineage was at least as strong as Dudley's. (At least one of Mrs. Figg's parents must have been a witch or a wizard for her to be classed as a Squib, while Petunia's sister, Dudley's aunt, was a witch.)

=== Connections ===
* The Dementor episode in this chapter triggers a change in Dudley's perception of Harry. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 3|In the final book,]] Dudley says that he doesn't believe that Harry is a waste of space, which Harry sees as the compliment that it is meant to be. We believe that Dudley's change of heart, as limited as it is, is triggered by Harry's saving him from the Dementors, and possibly reinforced by Dumbledore's visit at the beginning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 3|the sixth book.]]</text>

Conformation is the set of possible shapes a molecule can have by means of '''rotation about single bonds only'''.

Configuration is the relative position of the atoms in a molecule that can be changed exclusively by cleaving and forming ''new'' chemical bonds.

Isomers have different configurations, although the distinction may be blurred in compounds where steric hindrance occurs.

__NOTOC__
An '''Rice-Oat-Semolina Burger''' is a [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]] version of a [[Cookbook:hamburger|hamburger]], with a patty made from rice, oats, semolina, and onions.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Rice|Rice]]
* [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|Oat flakes]]
* [[Cookbook:Semolina|Semolina]]
* [[Cookbook:Onion|Onions]]
* optional:
** Chopped [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]]
** [[Cookbook:Maize|Maize]]
** [[Cookbook:Mushroom|Mushrooms]]
** [[Cookbook:Leek|Leek]]
** [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|Soy sauce]]
** Spices: [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], [[Cookbook:cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:oregano|oregano]], [[Cookbook:Savory|savory]]

==Procedure==
# Mix about the same amount of rice, oat flakes and semolina.
# Add water and stir until you get a viscous substance.
# Add spices to taste.
# Cut onions and leek into pieces and fry them with some oil, add maize, paprika and mushrooms to taste when the onions turn glassy.
# Fry in a hot, oiled pan. Use oil sparingly or the patties will be soaked in fat.
# You may want to flatten the patties a bit with the spatula.

==Tips==
* The patties are also quite tasty entirely without spices, only with onions.
* The patties can make a reasonably good substitute for fried chicken meat, e.g., for salads.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== A Brief Introduction ==

The goal of this Wikibook is to provide a full and easy to understand of all entities and organizations relating to the United Nations. The United Nations is the largest international organization where the voices of everyone can be heard. Celebrating its 60th anniversary in 2005 we look back and review what we have accomplished. The United Nations has worked to secure peace for sixty years and is still doing so even today. Hopefully this book will enlighten you on the main duties, accomplishments, and jobs the United Nations does.

== The Structure ==

This book is divided into chapters focusing on a single subject. These are further divided into sections focusing on a single aspect of the topic.

Each chapter is laid out in an easy to follow form. First an introduction will describe what the reader will learn in the section. Next the reader will be taught the lesson. Following this he or she will answer a series of questions to review the material. After completing all of the sections there will be a final Q &amp; A section. Finally there is a final chapter review of the material covered. 

== Glossary &amp; Index ==

In each chapter there will be several unfamiliar terms. So as to provide the reader with a full and explicit knowledge several of these terms will be linked to a glossary. In this Wikibook there are 2 types of information listings: Full-text Glossary and the Index. 


=== Full text Glossary ===
The full text glossary is the list of all words in the chapter. This is a master list and is separate from the Index. 

=== Index ===
The index is a full spectrum of topics and persons found within this Wikibook. Each listing found within the index includes the page it was found on.

== Contributions ==
Anyone wishing to edit or add information to this Wikibook may do so. We ask that you do not copy information not in the public domain. All discussion about this Wikibook will be held at: [[Talk:United Nations:Contents]]. For a list of need topics please go to the [[United Nations/Contributors Corner|Contributors Corner]].

== Om Namah Bhagwate Vasudevaye ==

[Mantra:]
'''Harinaya Garbha Purush Pradhana Avayakta Rupine, Om Namah Vaasudevaya Sudh Gayana Svarupine '''
(This Mantra was used by a great king who was also the grand father of another great saint and king Maharaj Prahlad. Maharaj Prahlad used this mantra too. It is also called the 12-word Mantra)

[Mantra:]
'''Om Namah Bhagwate Vaasudevaye '''

Hey Bhagwan, aap ko pranam hai. 
[God, I bow to you]

'''Is sansaar mein jeev ka Shri Vaasudeva ji ke alawa aur koi bhi rakshak nahin hai. '''
[In this world, there is no other protector of a being other than God]

'''Jeevan mein sukh ki pribhasha hai Sri Vaasudeva ji ko yaad karna. Aur Shri Hari ji ko bhool jaana hi dukh kaha gaya hai. '''
[Remebering God is defined as happiness or joy or comfort, and having forgotten God is the definition of misery and all sadness]

'''Aadmi Bhagwn ki jiti bhakti kar sake jeewan mein, utna hi accha hai. Jeewan ki safalta isi mein hai ki manushaya Bhagwan ki sada bhakti karta rahe. '''
[The more a person can worship God, the better. Life's success is in the constant worship of God]

'''Karne waale kewal Shri Hari hi hain. Main moorakhta se hi khud ko karne wala samajh baitha tha. '''
[God is the only doer. By my foolishness alone I mistakenly thought that I was the one who did it or I was the one who could do it]

'''Hum log helplessly hi samaya mein bahe ja rahein hain. Is maha sagar mein, kewal Shri Hari hi hume sahi rah par rakh sakte hain. Shri Vaasudeva ji ke charan pakade rakhna hi humari khush kismati hai. '''
[We are flowing in this vast flow of time, helplessly. Only God can keep us on the right track. It would be our good fortune if we can keep holding onto the feet of God]

'''Hum log bhavon mein aa kar Shri Hari ke alawa doosri cheezon ko bada maan baithte hain. Vaastava mein Shri Hari hain aur unke saman aur kuch bhi nahin hain. '''
[Because of emotions, we start thinking other things as big. In reality, there is nothing equal to God]

'''Kisi ka bura na chahein. Vaasudeva ji humare man mein hain aur doosron ke mano mein bhi. '''
[Don't wish bad for any one. God is present in our heart and in the hearts of others too]

'''Eeshwar ke bare mein kisi se kuch na kahein ''' 
[Don't speak of all this or God to any one]

'''Om Namah Bhagwate Vaasudevaye '''
[I bow to God]</text>

I've worked mostly at the English Wikibooks on the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Novial Novial language Wikibook]. At the English Wiktionary I have been adding [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novial Novial] entries to the Translations sections. This prompted a debate about which constructed languages are permitted in such lists. Novial as a well attested and historically significant international auxiliary language was approved.

At the English Wikipedia I've begun work on expanding the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novial Novial language] article. 

&lt;b&gt;A Wikipedia in Novial is [http://nov.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page here]. &lt;/b&gt;</text>

'''Fighting''', either in self defense or as an offensive measure, is an important skill to learn. To fight doesn't mean to attack, it also means defense and self reliance. Even if you do not plan on using any of the information below, you should be familiar with the basics. This manual is not a substitute for actual training; it is only intended as a rough summary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Organometallics is the  branch of chemical science studying the chemistry of molecules that have direct carbon-metal bonds.
{{stage|25%|Dec 30, 2005}} 
[[Image:Wide_Periodic_Table.svg|thumb|300px|right|s ,d, p blocks]]

==Main group organometallic chemistry==
===Alkali and akaline earths organometallic===

*Li, Na, K organyls
*Be organyls
*Mg organyls

===Aluminium group===

===Silicon group===
*Si organyls
*Ga organyls

===Pb, Sb, Sn, Hg===

==Transition-metal organometallic chemistry==

The organometallic chemistry of the transition elements is quite different from the main-group ones due to the availability for bonding of the ''n d'' orbitals with consequent ability for the central atom to change geometry and expand the octet.

[[w:Crystal field theory|Crystal field theory]]
===Single σ-bonding===
#M-alkyl
====β-elimination====

===π-acceptor bonding===

====alkene complexes====
[[Image:Pi-d_bond_structure.png|350px]]

[[Image:Resonace_structure_of-pi-d..png]]
====CO complexes====
# σ *→d&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;
# d&lt;sub&gt;π&lt;/sub&gt;→π *
These interactions are synergicin increading the M-CO bond strength. In fact, the second interaction, as known as ''pi backbonding'' increases the available electron density on the CO.

The partial filling of the π* orbital leads to a weakened C-O triple bond, as showed from the stretching frequencies (in cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) of CO free and in M/CO complexes.

[[Image:Carbene_synthesis.png]]
=====Schrock carbenes=====
[[Image:Wittig_carbene_reaction.png]]

==Catalysis by organometallic compounds==

===Metathesis===
[[wikipedia:Richard_Schrock|Richard Schrock]](MIT, USA) and [[wikipedia:Robert_H._Grubbs|Robert Grubbs]] (CalTech, USA) received 2005 Nobel prize for their work on the subject. Metathesis is the ''exchange of the termination'' between two alkenes {{ref|Grubbs05}}

[[File:Metathesis of olefines.svg]]

It occurs via the carbene species nowaday known as ''Schrock's carbenes''

[[File:Metathesis_mechanism.png|600px]]

# {{note|Grubbs05}} Grubbs, Olefin metathesis, ''Tetrahedron''

===Ziegler-Natta polymerisation===
[[wikipedia:Zieglar-Natta_catalyst|Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]
Ziegler in the 40's worked on the oligomerisation of ethylene by aluminium alkyls via the reaction HAl-R + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; HAl-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-R

[[Image:Ziegler_Natta_catal_mech.png|450px]]

===Enantioselective hydrogenation===
Wilkinson's

[[Image:CatalyticCycle.png]]

===Hydroformylation===
[[wikipedia:Hydroformylation|Hydroformylation]]
Hydroformylation is the process that transforms an alkene into an aldehyde by reaction with CO.

The catalyst is a hydridocarbonyl complex, HCO(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Image:Hydroformylation1.png|450px]]

===Fischer-Tropsch synthesis===
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is the heterogeneously-catalysed formation of hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes) from CO and hydrogen (synthesis gas). It can be seen as the inverse of [[w:Synthesis gas|synthesis gas]] preparation (although this is usually from methane and lighter hydrocarbons). It is the heart of the gas-to-liquids processes developed commercially by big petrochemical firms in the 90's.

==Organometallics in living systems==
The only example of a biological molecule containing direct carbon-metal bonds is ''cobalamin'', as known as vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Image:Cobalamina.jpg|center|300px|Vitamin B12]]

== Overview ==

'''''Gilderoy Lockhart''''' is famous in the wizarding world. He has been awarded the Order of Merlin, third class, is an Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defence League, and is the five-time winner of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Witch Weekly|''Witch Weekly's'']] Most-Charming-Smile Award. He is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher during Harry's second year. Lockhart has written many best-selling books chronicling his daring adventures, and he revels in his own celebrity.

According to information posted on the Pottermore web site, Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday is 26 January, and his wand is cherry and dragon heartstring. His rise to fame was apparently quite rapid, and he had graduated from Hogwarts (where he was in Ravenclaw house) only about a decade before his return as a teacher.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

We first see Lockhart indirectly, as the author of a book on Common Household Pests. As punishment for taking the car, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] sets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|Fred, and George]] the task of de-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gnome|Gnoming]] the garden, and tells them to check Gilderoy's book for instructions. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] volunteers to help, and like the others is soon spinning the gnomes around rapidly in circles to disorient them, then throwing them over the garden wall. This apparently is effective, as when they are finished, Harry sees a little line of dispirited gnomes heading off towards a distant copse; but near sunset he sees them all finding their way through the hedgerows and back into the garden.

When booklists arrive, it appears that the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has selected Lockhart's entire library, with the exception of his new autobiography, as texts for the course. Fred and George, who previously commented that Mrs. Weasley is sweet on Gilderoy, now guess that the new Defence teacher is a middle-aged witch. They also comment that the booklist won't be cheap.

When the family reaches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Diagon Alley|Diagon Alley]], they find that Lockhart is present in person at Flourish and Blotts' bookstore, signing copies of his new autobiography, ''Magical Me''. Mrs. Weasley is in line, and drags Harry, Ron, and the twins in with her; Ginny is holding back. When the photographer for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']] pushes Ron out of the way so he can get a picture, Lockhart spots Harry in line, and drags him up to the table, telling Harry that the two of them together will make the front page. He then gives Harry the full set of his books, smiling broadly all the while, and takes the opportunity to announce that he has accepted the job of teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Once released, Harry, retreating to the back of the crowd, finds Ginny, and dumps all the Lockhart books into her cauldron. Shortly after this, there is a physical fight between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], which is broken up by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]. While Mrs. Weasley is concerned about what Lockhart will think of them brawling in the store, Fred comments that Lockhart was talking to the photographer chap as to how to spin it for the best news value.

Harry and Ron, unable to reach the Hogwarts Express, use Arthur Weasley's flying car to get to Hogwarts. The car gets into difficulties and crashes into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]]. We next see Lockhart the next day as Harry is waiting to get into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Herbology|Herbology]]; he is walking alongside [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]], apparently having just been &quot;assisting&quot; her by telling her how to perform first aid on the tree. It is perhaps noteworthy that Professor Sprout is carrying all the first aid gear, looks somewhat exasperated, and has fresh bruises, while Lockhart does not seem at all the worse for the experience. Seeing Harry at the greenhouses, Lockhart takes him aside. Lockhart says he blames himself; having given Harry a taste of fame in Flourish and Blotts', he understands that Harry was only trying for fame and recognition when he took the flying car to Hogwarts. In a fatherly way, he cautions Harry that he may be reaching too high, and that he should tone down his search for recognition.

In the first Defence Against the Dark Arts class, Lockhart has the class write a test, to see who has read through the textbooks. Harry and Ron are astounded; the test is all questions about Lockhart. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] gets all the answers right, of course. Lockhart then proposes a practical example, and releases a cageful of Cornish [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pixie|pixies]]. The pixies promptly wreak mayhem on the classroom. Attempting to return them to their cage, Lockhart performs a spell which has no effect; a pixie grabs his wand and throws it out the window. At the bell, most of the class leaves; Lockhart, also departing, tells Ron, Harry, and Hermione to &quot;finish cleaning up here&quot;. Ron says he doesn't think Lockhart is much of a wizard. Hermione counters, saying &quot;Look what he's done!&quot; Ron retorts, quietly, &quot;What he says he's done.&quot;

A hero-worshiping [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Colin Creevey|Colin Creevey]] asks Harry to pose for a photograph. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]], passing by, starts making jokes about Harry giving out autographed pictures; Lockhart, arriving on the scene, puts himself in the center of the picture, then takes Harry off for some more &quot;advice about managing his fame&quot;. It is mentioned in passing later that the developed photograph shows Lockhart struggling to pull Harry into the picture and failing.

When Ron attempts to curse Malfoy, because Malfoy had insulted Hermione, his wand backfires, and Harry and Hermione take him to Hagrid for assistance, pausing to avoid Lockhart as he leaves Hagrid's. Hagrid tells them that Lockhart had been the only applicant for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position, and is uncharacteristically critical of him, saying that Lockhart's books might not be entirely truthful. He also jokes about Harry giving out signed photographs, and says that Lockhart was not happy about Hagrid's saying Harry is already more famous than Lockhart will ever be.

As they return to the castle, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] tells Harry that his detention for the flying car episode will be to assist Professor Lockhart with his fan mail, and that Lockhart had specifically requested him. Harry duly presents himself at Lockhart's office that evening, finding it full of posters of Lockhart, some of them autographed. Harry dully settles down to addressing envelopes, as Lockhart rambles on about the price of fame, and signs photos. Harry suddenly hears a voice other than Lockhart's, but looking around, cannot find the source. Lockhart, recalled to himself, notes the time and dismisses Harry.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mrs. Norris|Mrs. Norris]] is found hanging off a torch bracket, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] indicates a need to examine her; Lockhart volunteers his office. Dumbledore asks Harry, Ron, and Hermione to accompany them as they had discovered Mrs. Norris; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], Professor McGonagall, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Argus Filch|Argus Filch]] follow. As they enter, Harry notes the occupants of most of the Lockhart posters whisking themselves out of view; he believes he sees some of them wearing hair curlers. As Dumbledore examines the cat, Lockhart is prattling on about how he could have saved her if he had been there; Harry notes that the poster occupants are peering out around their frames, some of them nodding agreement, and sees that at least one is still wearing his hairnet. When Dumbledore reports that Mrs. Norris is not dead but petrified, Lockhart says that he can whip up a Restorative Draught in no time. Snape rather acidly remarks that he had thought he was the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Potions|Potions]] master at the school.

In order to determine if Draco Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin, Hermione hits on a plan to use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Polyjuice Potion|Polyjuice Potion]] to allow them to disguise themselves as Slytherins. The instructions for making Polyjuice Potion, however, are in a book, ''Moste Potente Potions'', which is in the restricted section, and they would need a note for it. Ron believes that they will have trouble finding a teacher thick enough to sign a note for a book like that...

Lockhart, meanwhile, after the debacle of the pixies, has resorted to re-enacting scenes from his books, with Harry's assistance. When we next see Lockhart, Harry is willingly playing the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Werewolf|werewolf]] foil to Lockhart as he acts out a scene. We see that Harry is unhappy with this, but we are told that he is playing up to Lockhart for a reason. At the end of class, Hermione, Ron, and Harry approach Lockhart with a note, and Hermione explains that she would like to take ''Moste Potente Potions'' out of the library because it would help her understand something in a different one of Lockhart's books. Lockhart signs the note with a revolting peacock-feather quill, and Hermione, with Harry and Ron in tow, heads off to the library to take out the book.

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] match with Slytherin, which occurs the next day, a Bludger appears to have been enchanted to concentrate on Harry. While he manages to avoid it for most of the match, as he is lining up to catch the Snitch, the Bludger hits him and breaks his wrist. Lockhart then, over Harry's protests, offers to help, but the spell he uses ends up removing all the bones from Harry's arm.

A week before Christmas break, there is notice of the creation of a dueling club. Harry, Ron and Hermione are interested and attend, but are dismayed when they find it's being run by Lockhart. By way of demonstration, Lockhart faces Professor Snape, runs through the formalities, and is quickly [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmed]] and flung off the stage. Rather than trying a second time, in the face of Snape's rather obvious anger, Lockhart has the students form groups of two. Snape intervenes at one point, separating Harry and Ron and leaving Harry to face Draco Malfoy; Ron is paired with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Seamus Finnigan|Seamus Finnigan]] and Hermione with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Millicent Bullstrode|Millicent Bullstrode]]. On the count of three, mayhem breaks out; amidst the flying curses we hear Lockhart shouting for everyone to stop, but it is Snape who [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Finite Incantatem|brings things to an end]]. Once the smoke has cleared, Lockhart suggests putting a pair of students on stage to demonstrate and suggests [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Justin Finch-Fletchley|Justin Finch-Fletchley]]. Snape says that is too risky for Justin, as Neville causes havoc with every spell, and suggests instead Harry and Draco. At the count, Draco [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Serpensortia|conjures a snake]]. Lockhart says he'll dispose of it, but his charm throws the snake ten feet in the air, and it lands in front of Justin. Seeing it is about to attack Justin, Harry tells the snake to stop, and is surprised when it does. Snape then destroys the snake, looking speculatively at Harry. Justin asks Harry what he thought he was trying to do, and storms off; Harry, Ron and Hermione leave as well, and Ron says that he didn't know Harry was a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parselmouth|Parselmouth]]. Harry admits he didn't know either, and Hermione points out that it is a very rare ability, and historically linked to the descendants of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]].

After Christmas, there is a long break without any sign of the Monster in the Chamber – Justin's Petrification before Christmas had been the last one. Lockhart, of course, takes credit for scaring away the creature, and suggests that they need a little &quot;morale-booster&quot;. On Valentine's Day, we discover what Lockhart's morale-booster is: the Great Hall ceiling is showering down heart-shaped confetti, and Lockhart has recruited a number of dwarfs, dressed as Cupids, to run around the school delivering singing Valentines.

When Hermione and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Penelope Clearwater|Penelope Clearwater]] are attacked, Professor McGonagall orders new restrictions for the safety of the students, including a curfew requiring them to stay in their dormitories, a ban on evening activities, and a requirement that they be shepherded between their classes by the teachers. Shortly after this, Dumbledore is suspended as Headmaster, and Hagrid is arrested as he is suspected of being the one who is allowing the Monster out of the Chamber of Secrets. Lockhart now says that the precautions that McGonagall is insisting on are pointless, as with Hagrid arrested there will be no more attacks; the other teachers, though, are not so sure, and are still being very careful about their guard duties.

Harry and Ron, having visited [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aragog|Aragog]] by this point, believe that it is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]] who was killed by the Monster when it was released fifty years before, and need to talk to her to find out what they can about the Monster. It is Lockhart's certainty about the threat being over, along with his fatigue at having to patrol the hallways all night, which allows them the liberty to go and speak with her: they suggest to Lockhart that they can find their way to their next class and that he looks tired. He goes off to his office, and Harry and Ron head off to interview Myrtle.

Having been redirected to the Hospital Wing and received some information from Hermione, Harry and Ron determine where the entrance to the Chamber is, and what the Monster is (a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]]), and so decide that they must speak with Professor McGonagall. They are waiting in the Staff Room to speak with her when students are sent back to their dormitories; hiding in a closet, they hear that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] has been taken into the Chamber. They also hear Lockhart, arriving late for the meeting with the staff, being called on his boasts about knowing where the chamber is and what's in it, and receiving instructions from McGonagall to go and deal with the Monster. Much shaken, he departs.

Harry and Ron find Lockhart in his office, frantically packing. Lockhart admits to them that he has not actually done the things in his books, that other people had done them and he had simply recorded what they had told him. The people who had done these things weren't photogenic, so it was better that he, the handsome and dashing one, take credit for their activities. And he also had a very good line of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|memory charms]] that would keep them from recalling having done the things that he was now claiming. So saying, he attempts to charm Harry and Ron, but Harry Disarms him. Ron throws Lockhart's wand out the window. With two wands pointed at his back, Lockhart is marched to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. There, Harry opens the entrance to the Chamber. Lockhart is sent down the tunnel first; Harry and Ron follow. Eventually, they discover a huge, cast-off snake skin. Lockhart seems to faint at the sight, then, grabbing Ron's wand, tells Harry and Ron that he will take some of the snake skin as proof that he had vanquished the monster, and oh too bad about Ginny. However, when he tries to use Ron's broken wand to modify Ron's and Harry's memory, it backfires and explodes. The ceiling falls between Harry and Ron, and Lockhart loses his memory completely.

When Harry returns from the Chamber with Ginny and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fawkes|Fawkes]], Lockhart can barely remember who he is himself, and only vaguely recognizes Harry. He spends the remainder of the book going where he is told, staring vaguely at things, and humming quietly to himself.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

While visiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]] in London, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny happen to see Lockhart, who is still recovering there from his memory loss. The charge nurse seems to be so pleased that Gilderoy has visitors that the four students feel compelled to stop and visit with him for a while. Gilderoy appears to have made little progress in recovering his memory; he cannot remember Harry, and is unable to remember why people keep writing to him. He has, however, regained his love of autographing pictures of himself, which the charge nurse finds encouraging, and he has finally managed to re-learn joined-up writing.

Harry's visiting Lockhart is primarily a way to introduce us to several other characters who are also suffering long-term spell damage: [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Broderick Bode|Broderick Bode]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Longbottom|Frank]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alice Longbottom|Alice Longbottom]], parents of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]].

== Strengths ==

His smile is an important strength, at least to him, and he refers to his five awards repeatedly and with what he considers to be charming humour (although Harry and Ron seem to find it slightly sickening). He has the ability to manipulate other characters by using his charm and physical appearance. He also seems to have excellent skill with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Obliviate|Memory charms]].

== Weaknesses ==

Lockhart is inept at using magic other than the Memory Charm. When he tries to mend Harry's broken arm, the spell goes wrong, causing Harry's bones to disappear.

Lockhart is a fraud, lying about his achievements in order to gain celebrity. In Defence Against the Dark Arts class, he only assigns his own published works as textbooks, and he brags constantly about his published exploits, adventures which we discover actually happened to other, less-photogenic wizards and witches. Despite all his magic going wrong, Lockhart does not seem to be aware that those whose successes he has claimed as his own have fed him false information as to how the deeds were done.

Lockhart has an overblown sense of his own importance, and an inability to view things from any viewpoint other than his own. He quite clearly seems to believe that Harry's sole motivation, like his own, is love of the limelight, and tries to give Harry tips on managing his fame.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Lockhart is popular with female characters in Chamber of Secrets, particularly Molly Weasley and Hermione Granger. He is a celebrity in the Wizarding World for his (fraudulent) exploits which he has documented in a series of best-selling books.

Lockhart exploits others for publicity, in particular creating headline-grabbing opportunities with Harry whenever possible. He forms a false attachment to Harry purely to generate publicity for himself. His supposed fondness for Harry is exposed as fake when he attempts to use a memory-obliterating charm on him.

== Analysis ==

Despite Lockhart's fame, Harry and Ron almost immediately see through his act, and consider him an ineffectual, self-aggrandizing fop. Harry may come to this conclusion even before Ron does; Ron apparently does not see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 3|the failure of Lockhart's de-gnoming technique]]. Many female students, including Hermione, have a crush on him, as do many middle-aged witches including Mrs. Weasley.

Lockhart is almost stunningly oblivious to other people. He seems to feel that everyone is as self-aggrandizing as himself, and keeps taking Harry aside to give him helpful little tips about how to manage his fame. He cannot see that Harry does not want to be famous. Harry sees, much more than Gilderoy, that when one is in the spotlight, every action, including the less flattering ones, is observed. Lockhart clearly feels that he can make no mistake, or can use a memory charm to cover over his mistakes, whereas Harry still feels quite keenly that he is not as much a part of the Wizarding world as he should be.

It is interesting, perhaps, that despite his many and sophisticated efforts to hide his fraudulent behaviour, the entire staff of Hogwarts, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Poppy Pomfrey|Poppy Pomfrey]] and Professor Sprout, both of whom are squarely in his &quot;middle-aged witch&quot; target demographic, seems to be aware that he is not who he claims to be. Dumbledore's comment on learning that Lockhart has destroyed his own memory, &quot;Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy?&quot; implies that he is not at all surprised that memory charms are what Gilderoy has based his success upon. Whether Dumbledore had already known this, or whether he was simply unsurprised by the revelation, is unknown, and ultimately unimportant.

It may be worth commenting on Lockhart's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wand|wand]]. We note that the author has made an effort to have the wand match the wizard's or witch's personality in some way; there is more information on this in the article on wands. Apart from his foppishness and self-aggrandizement, Lockhart is more than a bit of a romantic. For the sort of syrupy personality who could conceive of sending mock Cupids around the school to deliver Valentine's Day greetings, what would be more appropriate than heartstrings in the wand? We will note the romantic connotations of cherries, as well; but in thinking about that point, we must remind readers that the audience for this book is generally not yet adolescent, though not far away from it.

[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=9 The author has stated] that Gilderoy Lockhart is the only person in the books who is directly modeled on anyone in her life. [http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rubbishbin_view.cfm?id=3 She has further stated] that Lockhart was '''not''' modeled on her first husband.

It is somewhat difficult to understand why the author felt a need to introduce a character like Lockhart to the story. It is true that Harry must have some sort of antagonist in every book to afford interest before the climactic battle, whatever that battle may be. The author also seems to be quite skilled in the art of indirection, providing a low-level antagonist to deflect our attention away from the main battle. But why such a popinjay as Lockhart? Perhaps the intent is to show the audience that this type of adult does exist; we will grant that the intended audience for this book, those aged about 12 or under, likely have some experience detecting self-aggrandizement among their associates, and the author may be attempting to illustrate that the problem is not restricted to children. We suspect that by limning the existence of this sort of glamour, the author intends to try to somewhat inoculate her readers from it.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

#Lockhart's personality remains the same, even though his memory has been removed. What does this say about a person's character vs. a person's experiences?
#Why shouldn't someone lie about their accomplishments?
#Given Lockhart's character, and what he has done, which House at Hogwarts do you believe he should have been Sorted into? Why?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is uncertain whether Lockhart's reappearance in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'' was planned when Lockhart damaged his mind at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', or whether it was a fortuitous linkage. It is necessary to bring the Trio into contact with some people who have long-term spell damage; in particular, their meeting Broderick Bode at that point is a necessary side light to the plot, as it is part of the sequence that reveals [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's]] interest in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] stored at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]. It is useful, though arguably not necessary, to have the Trio introduced to Neville's parents at this stage; while the reader has been told about them, it does aid in our understanding of Neville for us to actually see them. Having Lockhart appear at the stairwell door does give us a much better &quot;hook&quot; into visiting with Bode and the Longbottoms than we would get any other way. Bode, wandering, would mean little to Harry, and the only time they would be likely to see Neville is as he is arriving at, or leaving, the ward. If Harry fell in with Neville as they were approaching the ward, likely the Trio would have gone on their way to the tea shop, out of delicacy, rather than staying with Neville as he went to visit his parents. And if Neville were leaving, there would be no incentive for the Trio to visit where he had just left. We have as yet met no other wizard with long-term mental damage, spell-caused or otherwise, and so we would have no reason to visit with Bode, absent Lockhart. His presence, however, could still be purely incidental, rather than being a plan on the author's part.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Experts have proposed dozens of psychological causes for stuttering. Then they use psychological tests to test their hypotheses. And, every time, the tests prove the &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; wrong. But this doesn't stop the experts from writing books promoting their theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1928, a Freudian psychologist advanced a theory that stuttering was an attempt to satisfy unresolved oral-erotic needs.{{ref|Bloodstein1995}} If this were true, there would stuttering phone sex lines. Imagine finding ads in the back of &lt;i&gt;Playboy&lt;/i&gt; magazine with scantily-dressed women saying, &amp;quot;Call me! I stutter!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1939 personality test study found that stutterers were more neurotic, more introverted, less dominant, less self-confident, and less sociable than non-stutterers.{{ref|Bloodstein1995}} Examination of the personality test found sixteen speech-related questions, including &amp;quot;If you are dining out do you prefer someone else to order dinner for you?&amp;quot; The psychologists had interpreted stutterers' reluctance to order in restaurants as evidence of neuroses, rather than as difficulty talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 1952 study of hostility and aggression found stutterers more likely to turn hostility inward. A 1953 study found the opposite.{{ref|Bloodstein1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other psychological studies found no difference between stutterers and non-stutterers for self-concept, levels of aspiration, body images, role perception, handwriting, social maturity, birth order, exaggerated fears, sleep disturbances, hyperactivity, temper tantrums, thumb sucking, and nail biting.{{ref|Bloodstein1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stutterers are, on average, psychologically normal, except for fears and anxieties around talking. We generally have the same speech-related fears and anxieties as non-stutterers, such as fear of talking to strangers and fear of speaking to an audience, but these fears are greater in stutterers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Freedom to Speak&amp;#151;Badly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the book How to Learn Any Language:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans, however, hold one high card that too frequently goes unplayed. We're gregarious. We're extroverts. Some say it contemptuously. Some say it admiringly. But those who know us best agree that we Americans are the only people in the world who enjoy speaking another language badly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people in the world are shy, embarrassed, even paralyzed when it comes to letting themselves be heard in languages they speak less than fluently. An American may master a foreign language to the point where he considers himself fluent. A European, however, who speaks a language equally well and no better will often deny he speaks it at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you an American&amp;#151;happy to talk even when your speech isn't good? Or are you a European&amp;#151;&amp;quot;shy, embarrassed, even paralyzed&amp;quot; when you can't speak fluently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or are you Chinese? In China, stutterers are expected to keep their mouths shut because stuttering will embarrass their families. You don't want the neighbors to find out that your brother stutters, so you find him work that doesn't require speech, and he stays at home the rest of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that doesn't sound fair to you, stick an American flag pin in your lapel. Then go out and speak English&amp;#151;badly, if you have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The First Amendment to our Constitution is freedom of &lt;i&gt;speech&lt;/i&gt;. Our ancestors believed that talking is the most basic human right. If you don't want to talk, are you throwing away the fundamental freedom that previous generations fought for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Change Your Lifestyle to Talk More&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask your supervisor to give you work requiring talking. This could be talking to customers, or calling suppliers, or training other employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or change careers to a job that requires talking. A man bought an anti-stuttering device, quit his job as a back room accountant at a bank, then worked at the Chicago Board of Trade, yelling orders to buy or sell soybean futures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or find a volunteer service requiring talking. Hospitals have information booths where volunteers direct visitors to their floors. Public television stations need volunteers to answer the phones during pledge drives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political groups need canvassers to collect signatures on petitions. Pick a cause you believe in. Imagine yourself standing on a busy street corner, talking to passerby about an important issue. Can you picture anything more American?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Complimenting People&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's another way to make the world a better place. Make eye contact, smile, and then compliment a person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't limit this to attractive, single persons of the opposite sex. Make everyone you meet feel good about themselves. Compliment old men, women pushing strollers in the park, the person behind you in the supermarket line, and your in-laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few compliments you can make about anyone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Compliment the person's smile. Then smile. This will make the person smile. Add a little joke such as, &amp;quot;Give my compliments to your orthodontist.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Compliment the person's eyes. This reminds you to make eye contact. Look into the person's eyes long enough to mentally note his or her eye color. A friend broke up with her boyfriend when, wearing sunglasses, she asked him what color her eyes were. He didn't know.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Compliment the person's name. This helps you remember the person's name. Associate the person's name with an interesting fact, e.g., ask how his or her name is spelled (e.g., Rebecca vs. Rebekah), the ethnic origin, or the meaning of the name. (I got a date with a woman named Alethea because I knew that &lt;i&gt;alethea&lt;/i&gt; is Greek for &lt;i&gt;truth&lt;/i&gt;). Ask if the person is related to a celebrity with the same last name. Read a history of your area to learn the names of local heroes and historical figures.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Compare the person to a celebrity. (A friend writing a personal ad asked if she looked like Natalie Merchant or Neve Campbell. I replied that she reminded me more of a young Tommy Lee Jones.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Listen for extraordinary things people have done, then reflect this back to them. Everyone thinks that their lives are ordinary. E.g., a man who flies jet fighters thinks of himself as an ordinary fighter pilot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Tell Stuttering Jokes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stutterer goes away to a two-week intensive speech therapy course on the East Coast. When he returns, his friends ask how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stutterer pauses, takes a deep breath, and slowly says, &amp;quot;Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His friends are amazed. &amp;quot;You said that completely fluently!&amp;quot; they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stutterer says, &amp;quot;Y-y-yeah b-b-but it's, it's h-h-hard t-t-to w-w-work th-that in-t-to a, a c-c-conversation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add more stuttering jokes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inward Anger vs. Outward Anger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering, like any frustrating experience, causes anger. Some individuals direct these feelings inward (i.e., they hate themselves). This leads to a vicious cycle or &amp;quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&amp;quot; of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But other stutterers direct these feelings outward. These individuals feel anger at other people. Their relationships at work or socially go poorly, again creating a vicious cycle of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you feel when people disrepect you when you stutter? Do you feel anger at yourself for stuttering? Or do you feel anger at the person who treated you poorly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you're angry, do you do nothing, but get angrier inside? That's inner-directed self-hatred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or do you take action to &amp;quot;send a message&amp;quot; nonverbally&amp;#151;which the other person is certain to misunderstand? I once &amp;quot;sent a message&amp;quot; to my housemates that it was their turn to buy toilet paper. Don't ask me what I did! They didn't get the message. They just got angry back at me. That didn't lead to domestic bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're doing [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Fluency-Shaping Therapy/Fluency-Shaping Techniques|fluency shaping therapy]] use slow, stretched syllables when telemarketers call. Do you look forward to annoying telemarketers? If so, your anger is directed outward. But if you refuse to annoy telemarketers, your anger is directed inward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outer-directed anger is easier to outgrow than inner-directed anger. E.g., you can't wait for telemarketers to call. You have your DAF device plugged into your telephone. You sit down to dinner, and the phone rings. It's the Munificent Police Protective Association. You happily draw out a forty-five minute conversation. Your dinner gets cold but your speech gets better. Then a friend calls, and you speak fluently at a slow-normal rate. You feel good about yourself and your anger drops away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, if your anger is inner-directed and a telemarketer calls, you decide not to practice your speech therapy, you stutter a &amp;quot;No, thank you&amp;quot; to the telemarketer and hang up. Your speech doesn't improve and your self-hatred continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If practicing speech therapy with a telemarketer scares you, have your speech-language pathologist pretend to call you. She'll try to sell you slow pitch bats, slow blow fuses, stainless steel slow cookers, and slow jam CDs. If you can't think of anything to say, ask, &amp;quot;How slow are the slow pitch bats?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then call her, reversing roles. Convince her that your slow blow fuses are the slowest, and that no one makes a slower slow cooker. Practice this until you're willing to practice therapy skills with a telemarketer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Denial Is a Bigger Problem Than What You're Denying&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a neighbor with schizophenia. He went to a dentist for a root canal, and the CIA put a radio into his tooth. The government was broadcasting messages to his brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like 40% of schizophrenics, he denied that he had the disorder. He'd lost his job as a chemical engineer, and now worked as a minimum-wage security guard. He had no friends other than me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My neighbor enjoyed reading French and Italian newspapers at a university library. He'd take the newspapers to the basement where no one would hear him repeating obscenities to annoy the CIA agents listening to his thoughts. One day security guards asked him to leave. To get away from them he ran into traffic in a busy street. He wasn't allowed to use the library after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider what would have happened if he'd told a librarian that he had a mental illness that made him talk to himself, and asked if there was somewhere he could read the newspapers without disturbing anyone. The librarian would have unlocked a conference room for him to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denying that he had schizophrenia took a lot of effort. His life would have been simpler if he admitted that he had the disorder. If you put more effort into denying that you have a disorder than the treatment would demand, then you have a denial problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He'd ask me whether I thought he was crazy. I'd say, &amp;quot;You're crazy if you deny that you have a mental illness. If you admit it, then you're not crazy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Avoidance is Denial&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denial can look like avoidance. Many stutterers will spend two hours driving to a store to see if the store has an item, instead of spending two minutes calling the store (and experiencing the embarrassment of stuttering).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many stutterers substitute words. E.g., saying &amp;quot;the great American pastime&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;baseball.&amp;quot; That's eight syllables instead of two, and some listeners won't know what you're talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When avoiding stuttering takes more effort than stuttering, you're denying how much effort avoiding stuttering takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's an extreme example of avoidance. A woman called me, inquiring about stuttering treatments. Her husband was a computer software engineer. He'd stopped talking. He'd requested a demotion at work to a position in which he never spoke to anyone. He sat in his cubicle, communicating by e-mail. At home he no longer spoke to his wife or children. He stopped participating in social activities or friendships. His wife was considering divorce. But ﬁrst she was learning everything she could about stuttering, in hopes of ﬁnding something that would enable him to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did this man have a stuttering problem? Or did he have a denial problem? He thought he could make his life easier by not talking. But the effort required to not talk (e.g., an unhappy marriage) outweighed the effort of talking (e.g., to his wife, who already knew and accepted that he stuttered). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&amp;quot;I Can Do It Without Help&amp;quot; Is Denial&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend lives in a state that provides anti-stuttering telephones free (see [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Finding Help Paying for an Anti-Stuttering Device|State Special Telephone Equipment Programs]]). He stutters moderately to severely. I suggested that he fill out the application to get an anti-stuttering device. He said no, he'd been to a good speech therapy program, and he knew what he had to do. He was determined to improve his speech without electronic devices, medications, or other help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been five years since he went to that speech therapy program. He still stutters. He's denying that the speech therapy program wasn't helpful. He's denying that he doesn't know what to do to improve his speech. He's denying that he needs help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a stutterer not in denial will use whatever's avail-able to improve his speech. If your state wants to give you a telephone that helps you talk fluently, why not take it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;quot;But I’ve Tried Speech Therapy&amp;quot; Is Denial&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider why crazy weight loss diets attract customers. People try the &amp;quot;pizza and ice cream&amp;quot; diet, it doesn't work, and then they can say that they tried to lose weight but the diet didn't work. Therefore no diet, exercise plan, or anything else will ever work. Therefore they have an excuse to be overweight. These people chose the &amp;quot;pizza and ice cream&amp;quot; diet instead of the salads and running ten miles a day diet. They chose a fad diet because they knew it wouldn't work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, some stutterers go to one speech therapy program, it doesn't help, and then write articles saying that &amp;quot;achieving fluency&amp;#133;is nearly impossible&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;stuttering is a physical impediment for which little can be done.&amp;quot;{{ref|Yeoman1998}} That's also denial. The person avoids effective treatments, by denying that effective treatments exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Denying the Most Important Thing in Your Life&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unaware how severely I stuttered (see [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/My Life in Stuttering|My Life in Stuttering]]). I thought that I had a minor speech problem. I tried to do everything that everyone else does. When I consistently failed at things most people seemed to effortlessly achieve (e.g., finding a job, finding a girlfriend) I didn't realize it was because talking to me was an excruciating experience for listeners. No one told me that. They just avoided me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I have a denial problem? Yes&amp;#151;but let me tell you about an accountant I had dinner with. He worked for the local government. He kept pen and paper next to his bed because he'd wake up with ideas of how to solve accounting problems at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first thought was, this guy needs a life! He dreams about accounting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I thought, he thinks about accounting 24/7. He must be a good accountant. When I need an accountant I'll hire him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My speech improved after I was 30, when I made stuttering the center of my life. I thought about stuttering 24/7. I'd wake up with ideas for how to solve speech problems. Speech therapy changed from something I did two hours a week in speech clinics, to what I did all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My denial problem wasn't that I didn't admit that I stuttered. My denial problem was that I didn't admit that stuttering was the most important thing I did. I'd pushed it to the side and focused on other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you focus on, you can achieve. It may take years of persistence but you will succeed. But you can only think about one thing 24/7. You don't want to spend your life climbing a mountain, get to the top, then see that you climbed the wrong mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Miracles Happen&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miracles happen when you focus on the most important thing in your life, and then everything else falls into place, effortlessly. E.g., you improve your speech, then your boss gives you a promotion. Then the pretty blonde at the photo store wants to be your girlfriend. It happened to me, and it'll happen to you. To read about more miracles, see the appendix [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering/Famous People Who Stutter|Famous People Who Stutter]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before your miracles can happen, think about my question. Is stuttering the most important thing you do? If you're a severe stutterer, as I was, the answer may be yes. Miracles aren't going to happen in your life until you think about stuttering 24/7. If your child stutters, you may have to focus on your child's treatment, rather than leaving it to the school's speech-language pathologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you're a mild stutterer, stuttering might be the wrong mountain for you to climb. You might be focusing your energy on avoiding stuttering, when listeners don't care whether you stutter. They might even like hearing you stutter occasionally. Maybe you should put your energy somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

== Overview ==

A '''''portkey''''' is a common item used to transport anyone touching it to another pre-determined location, such as a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]] match. Typically portkeys will activate at a specific time, but apparently it is also possible to create an on-contact Portkey that activates immediately when touched, or an on-command Portkey that activates on demand. A Portkey can be any sort of object, most often something of no value: an old teakettle, for instance, a discarded boot, or the head of a broken statue. A Portkey cannot, we believe, be a human.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Portkeys appeared in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] first as a means of getting to a major event, specifically the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch World Cup|Quidditch World Cup]], where it was used to transport those members of the Weasley family and those members of the Diggory family who were unable to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]]. It was later used to transport those same individuals back home. In this section, we learned that Portkeys would typically be unobtrusive items that would activate at a specific time, transporting all who were directly in physical contact with them to a specific other point.

A Portkey was also used to transport Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]] to the graveyard where [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] staged his return; in this application, the Portkey activated immediately upon contact, taking Harry and Cedric from the center of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Third Task|third-task maze]] to the graveyard, and then later carrying Harry and Cedric's body from the graveyard to the edge of the third-task maze.

On two separate occasions in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] is seen to create a Portkey, once to carry Harry and the Weasleys from his office to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|12 Grimmauld Place]], and later to carry Harry from the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] to Dumbledore's office. Both of these Portkeys seemed to be of the delayed-activation type, as in both cases Dumbledore counted down for the portkey to activate; in the first case, this was necessary because it was necessary to transport all of the Weasleys, along with Harry, to Grimmauld Place, in the second case it was because Dumbledore wanted to hand the Portkey to Harry. In the first case, though, it seems more likely that the Portkey was a command-activation type, because while Dumbledore did count down to the activation, he had made the Portkey before he had heard back from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|the portrait of Phineas Nigellus]], and he could not have known exactly when it was to activate until Phineas Nigellus had reported back.

== Analysis ==

When Dumbledore uses the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portus|Portus]] charm to create a Portkey in front of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] in the Ministry of Magic, Fudge, then Minister for Magic, seems shocked that Dumbledore would so lightly create an &quot;unauthorized Portkey&quot;. It appears that, because of their ability to deposit a person within areas that are protected from incursion (recall that both Hogwarts and 12 Grimmauld Place are protected by being made unmappable and by having spells to prevent [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparition]]), creation of Portkeys is controlled by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]].

Apparition requires a firm knowledge of the destination to which you will be going; one must assume that creation of  a Portkey requires at least that same understanding of the destination, probably even more. It is certain that the two Portkeys that Dumbledore creates are for destinations with which he is extremely familiar. It is interesting that, rather than create another Portkey for himself, Dumbledore returns to Hogwarts by way of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo Network]], especially since Hogwarts attachment to the Floo network is supposed to be somewhat thin.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] tells Harry that the area around [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Privet Drive|Privet Drive]] is being monitored for use of the Floo Network, Apparition, and use of Portkeys, ostensibly for Harry's protection, but actually to monitor where he is taken if he leaves there. From this, we may gather that Portkey use can be monitored if not prevented.

Portkeys are used [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 5|later in that same book]] to bring various groups from safe-houses scattered around the country to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]]. Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], for example, catch a hairbrush from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks]]' house. These Portkeys are timed; there is some discussion in the Tonks house about not missing the Portkey, and there is concern at the Weasley house because two prior Portkeys had already returned without the Order members who were to travel with them.

It has been mentioned that one of the problems with writing a book about magic is the entire issue of limitations. If your hero can do literally anything by means of magic, then you have no story. We believe that the regulation of transportation, as shown here by Fudge's reaction to Dumbledore's creation of an &quot;unauthorized Portkey&quot;, is a way of applying a judicial limitation to an otherwise over-extensive form of magical transportation. We have noted above that in the two instances where Dumbledore is seen to create Portkeys, the intended destination is unmappable and proof against most forms of magical access; Portkeys clearly can circumvent the barriers to use of Apparition and the Floo network that are present at Grimmauld Place and at Hogwarts. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|In the final book]], we are told that the use of Portkeys is being monitored in Harry's neighborhood; it would seem that the Ministry is able to detect not only that a Portkey is being created, but also that it is being used. This may be the only thing that prevents Voldemort from using a Portkey to enter places ordinarily forbidden to him, like the Ministry.

== Overview ==

'''''Parseltongue''''' is the language of snakes. A wizard capable of speaking Parseltongue is called a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parselmouth|Parselmouth]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The ability to speak Parseltongue is usually inborn; a wizard is born being able to speak Parseltongue, and those who are not born with the ability cannot normally learn the language (although, [http://the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript according to the author],  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] may have learned to understand it, and in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 31|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] has learned one word of it, though it is questionable whether he knows what it means). To date, the ability to speak Parseltongue has been almost entirely associated with those who can show direct descent from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]]. 

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], it turns out, can speak Parseltongue, though he was apparently not born with that ability. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], Professor Dumbledore suggests that when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]], who is Slytherin's last descendant, tried to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|kill Harry]], some of Voldemort's powers were transferred to him; one of those was Parseltongue.

== Analysis ==

Harry's ability to speak Parseltongue is first described in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 11|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']]; it is only there that we discover how rare this ability is and how it is linked to Voldemort. However, this is not the first use of this ability; in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 2|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], Harry speaks to a snake while visiting the zoo with the Dursleys.

The fact that Harry is a Parseltongue plays a major role in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', as it is his ability to understand Parseltongue that allows him to hear the Monster in the Chamber when it is prowling through the school, and because it allows him to actually open the Chamber. It also plays a lesser role in ''[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' where it allows him to understand the conversations between members of the Gaunt family as viewed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Dumbledore's Pensieve]]. It also plays a small role in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] where it allows Harry to open the locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], and allows him to understand the false [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]], and to understand Voldemort's instructions to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|Nagini]].

# In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Morfin Gaunt|Morfin Gaunt]] apparently refuses (or is unable) to speak anything except Parseltongue. How is Dumbledore, who is not a Parselmouth, able to understand what happens in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]] memory where Morfin is talking to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]]?

We learn in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 35|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']] that Harry's ability to speak Parseltongue is actually related to the soul shard that Voldemort lost when trying to kill Harry. That soul shard had attached itself to Harry, and was the source of this ability, as well as the ability to see into Voldemort's mind. The soul shard was destroyed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 34|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], and Harry's ability to speak Parseltongue went with it, according to the author.

The reason that Dumbledore can speak Parseltongue is never made entirely clear, but it is mentioned that he could speak some hundreds of languages, including Mermish and Gobbledegook. Having him understand Parseltongue as well would be relatively simple; apparently the ease of learning a language increases with the number of languages learned, even for Muggles.

While it is not directly associated with the language, we note that Harry is usually unable to tell whether he is speaking or hearing Parseltongue. When addressing the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, for instance, he only realizes that he hadn't spoken Parseltongue when Ron tells him it was English. No real explanation for this is given to us, nor is there any explanation for why Harry can tell the difference when visiting the House of Gaunt in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', but not in the following book in Bathilda Bagshot's house. We suppose it may have something to do with environment; Harry may be more likely to expect Parseltongue from the clutch of odd people in the Gaunt shack than in Bathilda's house. It is possible hat this lessened ability to tell the difference came about because the ability was simply dropped on him; if he had to work to learn the language, as we suppose Dumbledore did, he would be much more likely to differentiate. As it is, it is something he has always known, and so seems as easy for him as English. This inability to distinguish is a minor plot point at two places in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', and a somewhat larger one a Bathilda's house in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''.

== Overview ==

'''''Wingardium Leviosa''''' is a common spell used to levitate objects.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This is the first charm taught to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|first year]] class; it is a relatively simple charm, but only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is able to perform it correctly at first.

It is explicitly mentioned at three other places in the series. 

Firstly, during the same [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 10|evening it is introduced]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] uses it to levitate a club above the head of an attacking [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Troll|mountain troll]]; when he releases the spell, the falling club knocks out the troll. 

Secondly, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Harry uses it on a sidecar which has fallen off a flying motorcycle. In fact, Harry is actually in the sidecar when he uses Wingardium Leviosa on it; while it seems that the ability to fly unaided is exceptional among wizards, the ability to charm objects on which you are mounted is relatively simple. 

Thirdly, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 32|chapter 32 of the same book]], Ron uses the spell on a fallen-off twig of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Whomping Willow|Whomping Willow]] to touch the knot on the tree's trunk that will stop its branches from violently attacking anyone near the tree. The Trio then enters the tunnel that leads from the Willow to the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|Shrieking Shack]].

Wingardium Leviosa is also mentioned implicitly in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 31|chapter about Harry's O.W.L. exams]] in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', where it is the answer to the first question Harry reads in his theoretical Charms exam. Harry instantly remembers the defeating of the mountain troll in his first Hogwarts year mentioned above, and therefore the answer comes easily to him, which greatly reduces his initial nervousness.

== Overview ==

A '''''pureblood''''' is a witch or wizard who descends from other witches and wizards only (not [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggles]]).

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The followers of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] believe that there is a distinction between those who are descended entirely from those who are able to do magic and those who have non-magical blood in their ancestry. Echoing the views of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]], one of the founders of Hogwarts, Voldemort believes that non-magical ancestry somehow taints the bloodline. Only those with no such taint deserve to be called Pureblood, and only Purebloods deserve to be taught magic.

It is perhaps interesting that Voldemort himself is not a pureblood; while his mother, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]], was a member of one of the oldest Wizarding familes in existence, his hated father was a Muggle.

The term Pureblood first appears in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s hatred of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] clearly stems from this prejudice, and is evident from the beginning of the series.

== Analysis ==

The idea of &quot;racial purity&quot; pervades the entire series. While the core story is Voldemort's return to power, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s battle to prevent this, it is necessary for Voldemort's followers to break Wizarding law in order to restore him to power. The only way that they can justify this to themselves is to demonize the main Wizarding community, as being somehow sub-Wizard because of their Muggle ancestry. This is quite sharply brought out in the episode with the Gaunt family, as viewed in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 10|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. The Gaunt family would apparently rather live in solitude and squalor with their pride in being pure-bloods, than join the Wizarding community and accept the fact that their status was no higher than that of Wizards who had Muggle parents.

It has been mentioned in the discussion of Lord Voldemort that this emphasis on racial purity is very similar to the German Nazi ideas of pure Aryan heritage – and there is an interesting parallel in that Hitler himself was not pure Aryan, but had Jewish ancestors.

It is also mentioned, in the topic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Half-blood|Half-blood]], that in fact many half-bloods, including Lord Voldemort himself, are more powerful magicians than many Purebloods.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

There are a number of parallels between the earlier Dark period when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] was in power, and the Second World War; the author seems to have put the decisive battle with Grindelwald in 1945, and then imprisoned him alone in Nurmengard, a jail that he had constructed for his enemies, in an obvious nod to Rudolf Hess' imprisonment alone in Spandau Prison. The author has also remarked on an amazing similarity between the events in the Wizarding world between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Fudge's]] denial of Voldemort's return, and the appearance of Voldemort before witnesses in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] a year later, and the events in England under Chamberlain while the Third Reich was consolidating its power base. While the latter was apparently accidental, the former was not; and so we should not be surprised by similarities between Hitler's Final Solution and Voldemort's. One wonders if there is some Muggle philosopher who preached extinction of the unfit that Hitler was using as his role model, the way Voldemort (and, one supposes, Grindelwald) were basing their campaigns on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]].

== Overview ==

'''Petrificus Totalus''' is a spell that freezes or petrifies the body of the victim, making it incapable of moving, except for the eyes and breathing. It is colloquially known as the Body-Bind Curse or the Full Body-Bind, the latter being used apparently to differentiate it from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Locomotor Mortis|Locomotor Mortis]], the leg-locker curse. The spell can be broken by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Finite Incantatem|Finite Incantatem]] spell.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This is apparently a fairly simple spell, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] uses it on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 16|late in the first book]].

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] will use this spell himself on a number of occasions. Perhaps interestingly, it is almost exclusively used against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]], who is twice petrified by Harry in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|battle at the Ministry of Magic]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 35|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], and at the top of the Astronomy Tower in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], then by Hermione in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 9|all-night cafe in the Tottenham Court Road]], and finally by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Parvati Patil|Parvati Patil]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|the climactic final battle]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']].

It will be used by others on Harry as well; notably, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 8|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] will petrify Harry and break his nose, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 27|later in the same book]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] will petrify Harry to keep him out of the action and safe.

== Analysis ==

The Harry Potter story arc, consisting as it does of an epic struggle between good and evil, will have fights, larger battles, and perhaps even an all-out war. In order to prevent the series, ostensibly for children, from becoming excessively dark, there must be non-lethal weapons for the protagonists to use. To that end, the author has provided us with a number of disabling spells, ranging from the simple [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|stunning]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expelliarmus|disarmament]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Incarcerous|binding]] jinxes, through to those with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Tarantallegra|humorous]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Rictusempra|effects]]. It is uncertain why there would need to be so many different ways to disable, but we can surmise that the author has at least some reason for use of each variety. Notably, the full body-bind jinx here leaves the subject fully aware of what is happening, able to see and recall what proceeds around him after he has been jinxed.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

It is mentioned above that a person disabled by means of this jinx retains his sight and the ability to observe and recall events occurring around him. Apparently this knowledge of the passing scene on Dolohov's part is what alerts [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] to Harry's escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] in the Tottenham Court Road coffee house, after his departure from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows''. Voldemort would not, otherwise, have any reason to punish [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Thorfinn Rowle|Rowle]] for allowing that escape. As such, it is a useful plot point; knowing that Harry is no longer at any of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] safe-houses, Voldemort is likely to hold off on further torture of occupants of those houses, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron's]] family.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How to get the C++ source code for Celestia with the latest WinCVS

'''This page is obsolete.'''
Celestia code development now uses Subversion (SVN). CVS no longer works.
For details of building Celestia under Windows, please read the page [[Celestia/Development/Win32 platform|Windows XP 32bit &amp; Windows 7, 64bit]]


December 30, 2005


Step 1 Get Python. To download Python, go to the official Website. http://www.python.org/

Step 2 Get WinCVS, the Concurrent Versions System 2.0.51d http://www.wincvs.org/

Step 3 Enter info into WinCVS to prepare for getting source code

Step 3b Create a new folder on your Hard Disk. I suggest to
use a folder in the root. As an example my folder is: C:\CVS.
This folder will be the base for our local CVS tree.

Step 3c Use menu Admin:Preferences to set Home to c:\CVS

Step 3d Understand that the Sourceforge Repository is a
remote website. You will get your own copies of the source code
into your computer directory c:\CVS\celestia (or c:\celestia if
you make a mistake like I did).


Step 4 Communicate with the SourceForge website where the
C++ source code is kept

Step 4a Use the WinCVS menu Admin:Login...
A dialog window appears called Login settings.
Put a checkmark in the CVSROOT box

Step 4b
Paste this line in the login line for cvsroot
:pserver:anonymous@celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/celestia



Step 4c
When you are prompted for a password, do not type in anything,
just hit the OK button

The console should report your success with code 0, as shown
on 3 lines here:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/celestia login
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net:2401:/cvsroot/celestia

***** CVS exited normally with code 0 *****

If you get code 1, try again. Maybe the connection is too busy to
service your login.


Step 4d Checkout the files with these commands. The first time
this is a checkout. Future WinCVS sessions are updates, and
the commands are the same.

Step 4e Use the menu Admin:Command Line...

Step 4f check the box for CVSROOT and put this line in the space
next to that box:
:pserver:anonymous@celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/celestia



Step 4f2 : check the box for Execute in directory, enter c:\CVS

Step 4g paste the command on the next line into the big empty command line box:
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/celestia co -P celestia



Wait while files are then listed as they are sent to your computer. The console will show stuff like this :


cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/celestia -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@celestia.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/celestia co -P celestia (in directory C:\CVS)
cvs checkout: cwd=C:\CVS ,current=C:\CVS
cvs checkout: Updating celestia
U celestia/ABOUT-NLS
U celestia/AUTHORS
.
.
.

Wait while files are then listed as they are sent to your computer.

The files were put in c:\CVS\celestia

Also, download the Windows-specific shared libraries that aren't
included with Celestia on SourcForge. http://shatters.net/celestia/files/winlibs-new.zip
Unzip these files and put them in a directory with the other
library files.

Now you have the C++ files.

{{High_School_Mathematics_Extensions/Supplementary/TOC}}

We normally use the &quot;+&quot; sign to represent a sum, but if the sum expression involved is complex and long, it can be confusing.

For example:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1 \times 2} + \frac{1}{2 \times 3} + \frac{1}{3 \times 4} ...... + \frac{1}{100 \times 101}&lt;/math&gt;

Writing the above would be a tedious and messy task!

To represent expression of this kind more compactly and nicely, people use the summation notation, a capital Greek letter &quot;Sigma&quot;. On the right of the sigma sign people write the expression of each term to sum, and write the upper and lower limit of the variable on top and under the sigma sign.

Example 1: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=3}^{10} 2k+1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\ (2(3)+1)\ +\ (2(4)+1)\ +\ (2(5)+1)\ +......+\ (2(10)+1)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\ 7\ +\ 9\ +\ 11\ +......+\ 21&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border:2px dotted red&quot;&gt;
Misconception: From the above there is a common misconception that the number on top of the Sigma sign is the number of terms. This is wrong. The number on top is the number to substitute back in the last term.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border:2px dotted green&quot;&gt;
It would be useful here to indicate what values the lower limit of summation may take on.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Example 2: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{16}-\frac{1}{25}......-\frac{1}{9801}+\frac{1}{10000}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{2^2}-\frac{1}{3^2}+\frac{1}{4^2}-\frac{1}{5^2}......-\frac{1}{99^2}+\frac{1}{100^2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=\sum_{k=2}^{100} (-1)^k \frac{1}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border:2px dotted purple&quot;&gt;
Tip:If the terms alternate between plus and minus, we can use the sequence &lt;math&gt;(-1)^k=-1,\ 1,\ -1,\ 1...&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Exercise===
#Use the summation notation to represent the expression in the first example.
Change the following into sum notation:
#&lt;math&gt;23\ +\ 24\ +\ 25\ +\ 26\ +......+\ 1927&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;13\ +\ 16\ +\ 19\ +\ 22\ +......+\ 301&lt;/math&gt;
# *&lt;math&gt;1\ -\ 2\ -\ 3\ +\ 4\ +\ 5\ -\ 6\ -\ 7\ +\ 8......+\ 400&lt;/math&gt;(Hint:reorder the terms, or get more than one term in the expression)
# *&lt;math&gt;1000\ -\ \frac{3}{1\times(1+3+5)}\ -\ \frac{5}{(1+3)\times(1+3+5+7)}\ -\ \frac{7}{(1+3+5)\times(1+3+5+7+9)}......&lt;/math&gt;(Hint:You need to use more than one sigma sign)
Change the following sum notation into the normal representation:
#&lt;math&gt;\pi = 4\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\sin x = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!}x^{2k+1}&lt;/math&gt;
(Need more exercise,especially &quot;reading&quot; sigma notation and change back into the old form)

==Operations of sum notation==
Although most rules related to sum makes sense in the ordinary system, in this new system of sum notation, things may not be as clear as before and therefore people summarize some rules related to sum notation (see if you can identify what they correspond to!)

*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=p}^{q} A_i\pm c\ =\ \pm(q-p+1)c\ +\ \sum_{i=p}^{q} A_i&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=p}^{q} A_i \pm B_i \ =\ \sum_{i=p}^{q} A_i \pm \sum_{i=p}^{q} B_i&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=p}^{q} c A_i\ =\ c\sum_{i=p}^{q} A_i&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=p}^{q} \left [ \sum_{j=r}^{s} A_{ij} \right ] \ =\ \sum_{j=r}^{s} \left [ \sum_{i=p}^{q} A_{ij} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;
(Note:I suggest getting a visual aid on this one:showing that you can sum a two dimensional array in either direction)
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=p}^{q} A_i \ =\ \sum_{i=p-k}^{q-k} A_{i+k} &lt;/math&gt;(Index substutition)
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=p}^{q} A_i \ =\ \sum_{i=p}^{r} A_i + \sum_{i=r+1}^{q} A_i \; , where\; p \le r &lt; q &lt;/math&gt;(Decomposition)
*&lt;math&gt;\left ( \sum_{i=p}^{q} a_i \right ) \times \left ( \sum_{j=r}^{s} b_j \right )\ =\ \sum_{i=p}^{q} \sum_{j=r}^{s} a_i b_j&lt;/math&gt;(Factorization/Expansion)

===Exercise===
(put up something here please)

==Beyond==
&quot;To iterate is human; to recurse, divine.&quot;

When human repeated summing, they have decided to use a more advanced concept, the concept of product. And of course everyone knows we use &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;. And when we repeat product, we use exponential. Back to topic, we now have a notation for complex sum. What about complex product? In fact, there is a notation for product also. We use the capital Greek letter &quot;pi&quot; to denote product, and basically everything else is exactly the same as sum notation, except that the terms are not summed, but multiplied.&lt;br&gt;
Example: &lt;math&gt;\prod_{h=2}^{5} 2h-3&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;[(2\times2)-3]\times[(2\times3)-3]\times[(2\times4)-3]\times[(2\times5)-3]&lt;/math&gt;

===Exercise===
1.It has been known that the factorial is defined inductively by:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0!\ =\ 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;n!\ \times\ (n+1)\ =\ (n+1)!&lt;/math&gt;

Now try to define it by product notation.</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Moxon. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Moxon~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This page is for IMRT for head &amp; neck.

==Contouring targets==
*''See:'' [[Radiation Oncology/Head &amp; Neck/Anatomy|Anatomy and contouring]]


==Dose regimens==
'''''Simultaneous integrated boost:'''''
*'''PTV 66''' (primary), '''PTV 60''' (high-risk nodal), '''PTV 54''' (elective nodal) in '''30 fractions'''. (''2.2 Gy/fx, 2.0 Gy/fx, 1.8 Gy/fx''). Equivalent (acute effects) to ~69-73 Gy to the primary at 1.8-2 Gy/fx.


==Thermoplastic masks==
*'''Princess Margaret''' (2006-2008) -- standard immobilization mask vs skin-sparing immobilization mask
**Randomized. 762 CBCT scans in 20 patients. Arm 1) standard mask (SM) vs Arm 2) skin-sparing mask (SSM) modified with low neck cutouts
**'''2010''' PMID 20056344 -- &quot;Cone-beam CT assessment of interfraction and intrafraction setup error of two head-and-neck cancer thermoplastic masks.&quot; (Velec M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Mar 1;76(3):949-55. Epub 2010 Jan 7.)
***Outcome:  Initial interfraction sigma SM 1.6 mm or 1.1 degrees vs SSM 2.0 mm and 0.8 degrees. No difference after CBCT correction. Initial intrafraction sigma &lt;1 mm and &lt;1 degree for both masks.
***Conclusion: Interfraction and intrafraction setup error not significantly different between masks. Mask cutouts should be considered to reduce skin toxicity


==Daily setup variations==
*'''U. Wisconsin''' - PMID 15708257, 2005 &amp;mdash; &quot;The impact of daily setup variations on head-and-neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy.&quot; Hong TS et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Mar 1;61(3):779-88.
**Study of 10 patients treated with &lt;U&gt;conventional&lt;/u&gt; H&amp;N radiotherapy techniques (not IMRT). Immobilization with standard thermoplastic mask, room lasers, weekly portal imaging. Setup accuracy was assessed daily by obtaining positioning errors (3 translations + 3 angular) using an optically guided positioning system. The positional errors were applied to 10 H&amp;N IMRT plans for analysis of the impact of positional errors on the integrity of the IMRT plans over a 30 day course.
**Mean setup error in single dimension was 3.33 mm, composite vector of 6.97 mm. Tumor underdosing and normal tissue overdosing were common.
**Conclusion: More rigorous immobilization and patient setup are needed for IMRT.


==Treatment technique==
'''''Risk of extracapsular extension:'''''
*&lt;1 cm - 17-43%, 1-3 cm - 65-83%, &gt;3 cm - 67-95%.
*PMID 7316852 (1981, Johnson), PMID 7105450 (1982, Snow), PMID 4027895 (1985, Snyderman), PMID 3583851 (1987, Carter), PMID 2030629 (1991, Hirabayashi)


'''''Margin around lymph nodes:'''''
*PMID 16243444, 2006 &amp;mdash; '''MDACC''': &quot;Determining optimal clinical target volume margins in head-and-neck cancer based on microscopic extracapsular extension of metastatic neck nodes.&quot;   Apisarnthanarax S et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Mar 1;64(3):678-83.
**96 lymph nodes up to 3 cm with extracapsular extension were examined. Mean and median ECE extent was 2.2 and 1.6 mm. Was &lt;5mm in 96% of nodes. No correlation with size of lymph node and distance of ECE.
**Recommend 1 cm CTV margins to cover microscopic nodal extension.


'''''Time-to-treatment:'''''
*''Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Treatment_time|Time-to-treatment]] section


'''''Daily time of treatment'''''
*'''NCIC HN3''' -- morning RT vs. afternoon RT
**Randomized, proof of principle. 205/216 patients, receiving primary or postop RT. Arm 1) morning (8-10 AM) RT vs. Arm 2) afternoon (4-6 PM) RT; no chemo. Primary outcome mucositis
**'''2008''' PMID 18805649 -- &quot;Comparison of Toxicity Associated with Early Morning Versus Late Afternoon Radiotherapy in Patients with Head-and-Neck Cancer: A Prospective Randomized Trial of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (HN3).&quot; (Bjarnason GA, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Sep 19. [Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: Grade 3+ mucositis AM RT 53% vs. PM RT 62% (p=0.2). In patients with RT dose 66-70 Gy, 45% vs. 67% (SS). Also longer time-to-mucositis &gt;7.9 weeks vs. 5.6 weeks (SS). Significant benefit in patients who continued to smoke 43% vs. 76% (SS)
***Conclusion: Morning RT associated with significantly less weight loss, and reduction in oral mucositis in patients getting &gt;=66 Gy


'''''LN response by size'''''
*'''Brisbane (Australia); 2008''' (1997-2003) PMID 19032396 -- &quot;Predicting regional control based on pretreatment nodal size in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with chemoradiotherapy: a clinician's guide.&quot; (Porceddu SV, J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol. 2008 Oct;52(5):491-6.)
**Retrospective. 117 patients, HNSCC, N+, treated with concurrent chemo-RT. Median RT dose 70 Gy. Stratified into pretreatment LN &lt;=3 cm vs. 3-6 cm vs. &gt;6 cm
**Outcome: Regional control if LN &lt;=3 cm 88% vs. 3-6cm 72% vs. &gt;6 cm 50% (SS)
**Conclusion: Quantitative guide for regional control based on pre-rx nodal size


'''''Larynx/Hypopharynx RT'''''
*'''West Florida; 1992''' PMID 1616592 -- &quot;A technique for postoperative irradiation of carcinomas of the larynx and hypopharynx.&quot; (Amos EH, Med Dosim. 1992;17(2):65-7.)
**Postop RT technique. 15 degree lateral kick-out of table and 15 degree gantry rotation for each of 2 lateral fields. Benefit lower dose to shoulder and avoid hotspot near cord

*'''Univ North Carolina; 1991''' PMID 1869469 -- &quot;A comparison of postoperative techniques for carcinomas of the larynx and hypopharynx using 3-D dose distributions.&quot; (Sailer SL, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1991 Aug;21(3):767-77.)
**Postop RT techcnique for larynx/hypopharynx. Comparison of minimantle technique (MGH), 3F technique (University of Florida), 3F technique (standard), and kicked out lateral technique
**Conclusion: Favor kicked-out lateral technique for better coverage and homogeneity</text>

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|void}} keyword is used in [[C Sharp Programming/Classes#Methods|method]] signatures to declare a method that does not return a value. A method declared with the {{C sharp|void}} return type cannot provide any arguments to any {{C sharp/kw|return|{{C sharp|return}}}} statements they contain.

Example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public void WorkRepeatedly (int numberOfTimes)
{
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfTimes; i++)
        if(EarlyTerminationIsRequested)
            return;
        else
            DoWork();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Diastereomers=
'''Diastereomers''' are stereoisomers that are not enantiomers (mirror images) of each other. Due to their different shape, diastereomers can have different physical and chemical properties.  This is perhaps especially true of diastereomers involved in biological systems.

According to IUPAC the term &quot;geometric isomerism&quot; is an obsolete synonym of &quot;cis-trans isomerism&quot; and its use is strongly discouraged. Sometimes the term &quot;geometric isomerism&quot; has been used as a synonym of stereoisomerism, i.e. optical isomers being considered to be geometric isomers. This, however, is not consistent with current standard chemical nomenclature. The exact term for stereoisomers that are not optical isomers is diastereomers.

A special kind of diastereomer is an epimer. Epimers are diastereomers that differ at one of several asymmetric carbon atoms. There is also something called an anomer, a special type of epimer. An anomer differs at a new asymmetric carbon atom when a ring is formed (in carbohydrate chemistry).

== Cis-trans Isomerism ==

''Stereoisomerism'' can occur when a double bond is present, because the pi bond involved prevents that bond from being &quot;twisted&quot; the same way that a single bond can be.  A good example is 1,2-dichloroethene: C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Consider the two examples below:
[[Image:Dichloroethene.png|center|200px|Dichloroethene isomers]]
The two molecules shown above are ''cis''-1,2-dichloroethene and ''trans''-1,2-dichloroethene.  These two molecules are geometrical isomers because the two carbon atoms cannot be rotated relative to each other, due to the rigidity caused by the pi bond between them. Therefore, they are not &quot;superimposeable&quot; - they are not identical, and cannot take each other's place. Cis/trans isomers have different chemical and physical properties and can exhibit dramatically different biological activity.

'''Cis-trans isomerism''' (Often called '''geometric isomerism''' although this term refers to all stereoisomers) is a form of stereoisomerism and describes the orientation of functional groups at the ends of a bond around which no rotation is possible. Both alkenes and cycloalkanes have restricted rotation around certain bonds. In alkenes, the double bond restricts movement and rotation, as does the looped structure of cycloalkanes.

Rotation is possible around the double bond of an alkene but it requires between 60 and 70 kcal of energy. Without the addition of this energy, groups that start on one side of the double bond stay there. This is the basis of cis/trans isomerism.

There are two forms; the cis and trans isomers. The form in which the substituent hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the bond that doesn't allow rotation is called ''cis''; the form in which the substituent hydrogens are on opposite sides of the bond is called ''trans''. An example of a small hydrocarbon displaying cis-trans isomerism is 2-butene.

'''Cis isomers''' and '''trans isomers''' of a substance have different physical properties. Trans isomers generally have higher boiling points and lower densities. This is because the trans isomers molecules can line up and fit together better than the cis form. Two isomers with very different properties are maleic acid and fumaric acid. The names are two trivial names for 2-butenedioic acid and repectively the cis and trans isomer.

Cycloalkanes and similar compounds can also display cis-trans isomerism. As an example of a geometric isomer due to a ring structure, consider 1,2-dichlorocyclohexane. These compounds can be named more rigorously using [[Organic Chemistry/Chirality/R-S notational system|R/S notation]].

{|
|[[Image:cis-C6H4Cl2.png]]
|[[Image:trans-C6H4Cl2.png]]
|-
|cis-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane
|trans-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane
|-
|1(R),2(S)-dichlorocyclohexane
|1(S),2(S)-dichlorocyclohexane
|}

== E/Z notation ==

Main article: [[Organic Chemistry/Chirality/R-S notational system#E-Z Notation|E-Z System]]

The trans/cis system for naming isomers breaks down when there are more than two different substituents on a double bond. (The cis/trans system should only be used when the carbon atoms involved each have a hydrogen atoms attached). The E/Z notation is unamibiguous. Z (from the German ''zusammen'') means together and usually corresponds to the term ''cis''; E (from the German ''entgegen'') means opposite and usually corresponds to the term ''trans''.

Usually, E isomers are more stable than Z isomers because of steric effects. When two large groups are closer to each other, as they often are with Z, they interfere more with each other and have a higher potential energy than with E, where the large groups are farther apart and interfere less with each other.

=Diastereomers with stereocenters=

In simple terms, two stereoisomers are diastereoisomers of each other if ''only one'' chiral center differs between the two stereoisomers.  That is to say, if both molecules contain two or more chiral centers, but if only one of the chiral centers in each molecule is different than the other, then the two molecules are diastereoisomers of one another.

If a molecule contains a single asymmetric carbon atom or ''stereocenter'', it will have two mirror image forms. If a molecule contains two asymmetric carbons, there are four possible configurations, and it would be mathematically and physically impossible for all four to be mirror images of each other.  The more chiral centers in a molecule, the more possibilities there are for different conformers, and therefore the more possible diastereomers exist.

As an example, tartaric acid contains two asymmetric centers, but two of the configurations of the tartaric acid molecule are equivalent to one another -- and together they are called meso compounds. This configuration is not optically active, while the remaining two configurations are &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;- and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;- mirror images. For this reason, the meso form of tartaric acid is a diastereomer of the other forms.

|
|}

''The meso form of tartaric acid (right) is a diastereomer of the other forms.''

&lt;/center&gt;

Two common prefixes used to distinguish diastereomers are '''threo''' and '''erythro'''. When drawn in the Fischer projection the ''erythro'' isomer has two identical substituents on the same side and the ''threo'' isomer has them on opposite sites.

==Carbohydrates==
The families of 5 and 6 carbon carbohydrates contain many diastereomers because of the large numbers of asymmetric centers in these molecules.  Since each carbon in the primary chain of an aldose (one type of carbohydrate) and all but one of the carbons in in the primary chain of a ketose (another type of carbohydrate) have both a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group attached, most of the carbons in any given sugar are actually chiral.  Since the number of possible conformers for a chiral molecule is 2 raised to the ''n'' power (2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''n'' is the number of chiral centers, this makes for a great deal of variability in carbohydrates and a large number of diastereomers.

&lt;center&gt;

''D-glucose and L-glucose are enantiomers. Other pairs of sugars (e.g. L-glucose and D-mannose)are diastereomers.''
&lt;/center&gt;

Glucose adopts a ring structure in solution. This is awkward to show with a Fischer projection so a Haworth projection is usually used instead:

&lt;center&gt;

[[Image:D-glucose-chain-2D-Fischer.png|100px]] [[Image:Glucose_Haworth.png|200px]]


[[Image:Glucose_Fisher_to_Haworth.gif]]


[[Image:Glucose-Fisher-to-Haworth.png|800px]]

&lt;/center&gt;

-OH groups on the right of a Fischer projection are drawn below the ring in the Haworth projection.

=Diastereoselectivity=
'''Diastereoselectivity''' is the preference for the formation of one or more than one diastereomer over the other in an organic reaction.

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|using}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|using}} keyword has two completely unrelated meanings in C#, depending on if it is used as a directive or a statement.

==The directive==
{{C sharp|using}} as a ''directive'' resolves unqualified type references so that a developer doesn't have to specify the complete namespace.

Example:
&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
 
// A developer can now type ''Console.WriteLine();'' rather than ''System.Console.WriteLine()''.
&lt;/source&gt;

{{C sharp|using}} can also provide a ''namespace alias'' for referencing types.

Example:
&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using utils = Company.Application.Utilities;
&lt;/source&gt;

==The statement==
{{C sharp|using}} as a ''statement'' automatically calls the {{C sharp|dispose}} on the specified object. The object must implement the {{C sharp|IDisposable}} interface. It is possible to use several objects in one statement as long as they are of the same type.

Example:
&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using (System.IO.StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(&quot;readme.txt&quot;))
{
    // read from the file
}
 
// The file readme.txt has now been closed automatically.

using (Font headerFont = new Font(&quot;Arial&quot;, 12.0f),
            textFont = new Font(&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, 10.0f))
{
    // Use headerFont and textFont.
}

// Both font objects are closed now.
&lt;/source&gt;

{{wikipedia}}
Podcasting is the so-called ''syndicated'' publishing or distribution of audio or video programmes on the Internet. Podcasts are in MP3, MPEG or a similar file format.  Podcast producers make their programmes available with RSS feeds, a tool that allows listeners to select programmes they wish to download, or to set software to automatically download new programmes as they become available.

==Podcasting for listeners==
Listening to podcasts is easy and enjoyable. You can listen to any topic, at any time of the morning, day, or night, 24/7.  But to listen to a podcast, you need to be able to find them. Locating podcasts by relevant topics is done through Podcast Directories.

The {{C sharp|double}} keyword is used in field, [[C Sharp Programming/Classes#Methods|method]], [[C Sharp Programming/Classes#Properties|property]], and variable declarations and in ''cast'' and {{C sharp|typeof}} operations as an alias for the .NET Framework structure {{C sharp|System.Double}}. That is, it represents an IEEE 754, 64-bit signed binary floating point number whose value is ''negative 0'', ''positive 0'', ''negative infinity'', ''positive infinity'', ''not a number'', or a number ranging either from &lt;math&gt;-5.0 \times 10 ^{-324}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;-1.79 \times 10^{308}&lt;/math&gt; or from &lt;math&gt;5.0 \times 10^{-324}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1.79 \times 10^{308}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm going to change the second sentence of Henotheism from &quot;The difference between henotheism and monolatrism is that henotheists seem not to believe that the non-worshipped gods have no power on those who don't believe in them.&quot; to &quot;The difference between henotheism and monolatrism is that henotheists seem believe that the non-worshipped gods have power on those who don't believe in them.&quot; I got rid of the double negative. If I have misinterpreted it, then please try to clarify it, as it is very hard to understand.

== Ancestor Worship ==
It seems to me that it lacks ancestor worship as one of the religion types. As I know literally nothing about that type of religion, would someone more knowledgable than I please create it. [[User:Ydirbut|Ydirbut]] 19:39, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

== Agnosticism ==

The description of Agnosticism is totally incorrect. It starts with: &quot;When a people believe there is a higher power ...&quot; Unfortunately this is not Agnosticism. According to the American Heritage Dictionary (2000), Agnosticism is:
 * 1. The doctrine that certainty about first principles or absolute truth is unattainable and that only perceptual phenomena are objects of exact knowledge.
 * 2. The belief that there can be no proof either that God exists or that God does not exist.
And Encarta Dictionary (2005) has simply:
 * View that God’s existence is unprovable: the belief that it is impossible to know whether or not God exists
The presupposition that a deity exists, as in the definition provided here, is incorrect. Agnostics neither assume that a deity exists, nor do they assume that one does not. So the rest of the definition simply doesn't apply. A simpler and far more accurate definition of Agnositicism would be: &quot;Belief that no deity's existence can be known for certain.&quot;
Also, I should note that the idea that believing a deity requires having &quot;set rules&quot; for it/him/her, is equally erroneous. There are religions which believe in deities, but which accept a certain amount of subjectivity; for instance, the classical Gnostics, and their forerunners in the Greco-Roman mystery-religions.

As nobody is taking any initiative, I'll go ahead and change it myself. --[[User:Ajallan|Ajallan]] 17:18, 31 October 2007 (UTC)

== More? ==
Isn't religion also about  abstract ideas, philosophies, stories, legends, myths, etc, and not only gods?

: Yes, I would say so.  You'll notice this book is listed as at the lowest stage of completion &amp;mdash; the box in the upper right of the main main of the book (and so far only page of the book) has zero out of four quarters shaded.

: This is quite a challenging topic to write a neutral book about; not impossible, but quite challenging.  One would want to ask oneself, what is the available literature on the subject, and study up on it, to avoid simply loading one's own biases into the book.  I suspect there's not an awful lot of high-quality stuff written out there about religion-construction.  Probably comparative religion/mythology/folklore is what one would study.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 10:48, 8 April 2013 (UTC)

== Rules ==
Most religions have rules on how one should or shouldn't behave, and how they can reach some goal. This might be important.
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:97.85.166.212|97.85.166.212]] ([[User talk:97.85.166.212|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/97.85.166.212|contribs]]) 23:33, 10 April 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Demons ==
Could a major demon or evil being be considered a deity?
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:97.85.166.212|97.85.166.212]] ([[User talk:97.85.166.212|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/97.85.166.212|contribs]]) 23:33, 10 April 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Physical ==
Many religions make their god(s) seem like physical beings, but is there any where this isn't the case?
&lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:97.85.166.212|97.85.166.212]] ([[User talk:97.85.166.212|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/97.85.166.212|contribs]]) 23:33, 10 April 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Suggestion ==
You should begin with how religions form and evolve through time. :-)

== Examples ==
May you show some examples of real and fictional religions in this book?</text>

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|bool}} keyword is used in field, [[C Sharp Programming/Classes#Methods|method]], [[C Sharp Programming/Classes#Properties|property]], and variable declarations and in {{C sharp|cast}} and {{C sharp|typeof}} operations as an alias for the .NET Framework structure {{C sharp|System.Boolean}}. That is, it represents a value of {{C sharp|true}} or {{C sharp|false}}. Unlike in C++, whose ''boolean'' is actually an ''integer'', a {{C sharp|bool}} in C# is its own data type and cannot be cast to any other primitive type.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|new}} keyword has two different meanings:
# It is an operator that requests a new instance of the class identified by its argument.
# It is a modifier that explicitly hides a member.

As an example, see the code below:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class Car
{
    public void go()
    {
    }
}

Car theCar = new Car();       // The new operator creates a Car instance

int i = new int();            // Identical to … = 0;

public class Lamborghini : Car
{
    public new void go()      // Hides Car.go() with this method
    {
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|if}}

The {{C sharp|if}} keyword identifies an [[C Sharp Programming/Control#if statement|{{C sharp|if}} statement]] with the following syntax:
:''if-statement'' ::= &quot;if&quot; &quot;(&quot; ''condition'' &quot;)&quot; ''if-body'' [&quot;else&quot; ''else-body'']
:''condition'' ::= ''boolean-expression''
:''if-body'' ::= ''statement-or-statement-block''
:''else-body'' ::= ''statement-or-statement-block''

If the ''condition'' evaluates to {{C sharp/kw|true}}, the ''if-body'' executes. Curly braces (&quot;{{C sharp|{}}&quot; and &quot;{{C sharp|}}}&quot;) allow the ''if-body'' to contain more than one statement. Optionally, an {{C sharp|else}} clause can immediately follow the ''if-body'', providing code to execute when the ''condition'' is ''false''. Making the ''else-body'' another {{C sharp|if}} statement creates the common ''cascade'' of {{C sharp|if}}, {{C sharp|else if}}, {{C sharp|else if}}, {{C sharp|else if}}, {{C sharp|else}} statements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using System;

public class IfStatementSample
{
    public void IfMyNumberIs()
    {
        int myNumber = 5;
        if (myNumber == 4)
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;This will not be shown because myNumber is not 4.&quot;);
        else if(myNumber &lt; 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;This will not be shown because myNumber is not negative.&quot;);
        }
        else if(myNumber%2 == 0)
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;This will not be shown because myNumber is not even.&quot;);
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;myNumber does not match the coded conditions, so this sentence will be shown!&quot;);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The boolean expression used in an {{C sharp|if}} statement typically contains one or more of the following operators:

{| border=1 align=center
!width=25|Operator
!width=|Meaning
!width=25|Operator
!width=|Meaning
|----
| &lt; || less than || &gt; || greater than
|----
| == || equal to || != || not equal to
|----
| &lt;= || less than or equal to || &gt;= || greater than or equal to
|----
| &amp;&amp; || and || &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt; || or
|----
| ! || not
|}

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|else}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|else}} keyword identifies a [[C Sharp Programming/Control#if statement|{{C sharp|else}} clause]] of an {{C sharp|if}} statement with the following syntax:

:''if-statement'' ::= &quot;{{C sharp|if}}&quot; &quot;{{C sharp|(}}&quot; ''condition'' &quot;{{C sharp|)}}&quot; ''if-body'' &quot;'''{{C sharp|else}}'''&quot; ''else-body''
:''condition'' ::= ''boolean-expression''
:''if-body'' ::= ''statement-or-statement-block''
:''else-body'' ::= ''statement-or-statement-block''

An {{C sharp|else}} clause immediately follows an ''if-body''. It provides code to execute when the ''condition'' is ''false''. Making the ''else-body'' another {{C sharp|if}} statement creates the common ''cascade'' of {{C sharp|if}}, {{C sharp|else if}}, {{C sharp|else if}}, {{C sharp|else if}}, {{C sharp|else}} statements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using System;

public class IfStatementSample
{
    public void IfMyNumberIs()
    {
        int myNumber = 5;
        if (myNumber == 4)
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;This will not be shown because myNumber is not 4.&quot;);
        else if(myNumber &lt; 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;This will not be shown because myNumber is not negative.&quot;);
        }
        else if(myNumber%2 == 0)
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;This will not be shown because myNumber is not even.&quot;);
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;myNumber does not match the coded conditions, so this sentence will be shown!&quot;);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example only checks whether {{C sharp|myNumber}} is less than 0, if {{C sharp|myNumber}} is not 4. It in turn only checks whether {{C sharp|myNumber%2}} is 0, if {{C sharp|myNumber}} is not less than 0. Since none of the conditions are true, it executes the body of the final {{C sharp|else}} clause.

{{Wikipedia|Euchre}}
This book is about the most commonly played variation of Euchre and explains the various playing techniques and advanced strategy.  Since all of the strategy is based on probabilities, the appendices contain some information in that area for the curious reader.  Perhaps future revisions will contain chapters on other play variations and how it affects the strategy.

== How to Play/Rules of Game ==
Euchre is played with 24 cards, 9 through Ace of each suit.  Two teams of two players each face off, playing cards alternately (players from the same team sit across from each other), trying to get to 10 points first.  Each hand, each player is dealt 5 cards, meaning that 4 cards are out of play.  These 4 cards are referred to as the &quot;kitty.&quot;

== Trick-Based Games ==
Euchre is one of many &quot;trick&quot;-based games.  In trick-based games, one player leads (i.e., plays the first card), and proceeding to the left, each subsequent player must play a card of the same suit as the one led.  However, if a player has no cards of the suit led, he or she may play any card in his or her hand.  A trick is &quot;won&quot; by the highest card of the suit that was led, with one exception.  Euchre is also a trump-based game, meaning that one suit is chosen to be &quot;trump&quot; and beats all of the others.  In this case, if a player has no cards of the suit led and plays any card from the chosen trump suit, then the highest trump card played wins the trick rather than the highest card of the suit led.  Whoever wins the trick gets to lead the next trick.  Since each player is dealt 5 cards, each hand of Euchre features 5 tricks.  Whichever team takes the majority of tricks earns points for the hand, either 1, 2, or 4 points, depending on the circumstances.

== Deciding on Trump ==
After dealing but before each hand is played, the players go through a process to determine which suit will be trump.  This process is sometimes referred to as &quot;bidding,&quot; since other similar games have a more-involved process that actually involves bidding.  After dealing, the top card of the kitty is revealed and is called the &quot;upcard.&quot;  At first, the players are deciding whether or not to have the dealer pick up the upcard (and discard a different card) and make that suit trump.  One confusing point for beginners is that the dealer always picks up the upcard, not the player who &quot;orders it up.&quot;  Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, each player has a choice to &quot;order it up&quot; or pass.  If all 4 players pass, the upcard is left in the kitty, and it starts again with players being able to choose any other suit as trump, or passing.  For example, if the upcard was the King of Hearts, then Hearts may no longer be chosen as trump.  If the bidding gets around to the dealer a second time, he or she must choose trump and is not allowed to pass.  Whichever team chooses trump is known as the &quot;makers&quot; and the other team is known as the &quot;defenders.&quot;  Finally, whenever a player chooses trump, he or she may optionally go after the hand alone, meaning the partner does not play any cards.  See the section on Scoring below.

== Scoring ==
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the makers get 5 tricks alone, 4 points are awarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the makers get 5 tricks together, 2 points are awarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the makers get 3 or 4 tricks together or alone, 1 point is awarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the defenders get 3 or more tricks, 2 points are awarded.  This is known as &quot;setting&quot; or &quot;getting Euchred.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;If you go alone and get set the defenders still only get 2 points you do not get 4 points for a Euchre.

== Bowers and Next ==
The final often confusing point in Euchre relates to the Bowers.  Whichever suit is chosen as trump, the Ace is no longer the high card, rather the Jack of that suit is considered the high card and is called the Right Bower.  Additionally, the Jack of the same color suit (known as &quot;next&quot;) is &quot;re-suited&quot; to be trump and is called the Left Bower and is the second highest card.  It then proceeds normally: Ace-King-Queen-Ten-Nine.  The confusing part is that the Left Bower is considered to be of the trump suit rather than its printed suit--which affects what cards you can play when following the suit led!  For example, if Hearts is trump, then the Jack of Diamonds is the Left Bower and is considered to be a Heart, not a Diamond.  So if a Heart is led, you may be forced to follow with the Jack of Diamonds, and if a Diamond is led, you cannot play the Jack if you have other Diamonds in your hand.  This means that there are 7 trump cards, 5 cards in next, and 6 cards in each of the opposite-color suits.  This asymmetry is the root of many strategic and tactical decisions.
== Seating Assignments and Abbreviations Used ==
In the rest of the book, we will refer to players and cards with a shorter notation.  The players are numbered, like so:
&lt;pre&gt;
            Second/2

     First/1         Third/3

            Fourth/4
             Dealer
&lt;/pre&gt;
where player 4 is the dealer and player one sits to the dealer's left.  So players 1 and 3 are partners and players 2 and 4 are partners.  When describing cards, we use the following abbreviations:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right Bower = R &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Left Bower = L &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ace = A &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;King = K &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queen = Q &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opposite colored Jack = J &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 = 10 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 = 9 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hearts = H &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diamonds = D &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clubs = C &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spades = S &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trump = T &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next = N &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opposite colored Offsuite = O &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Since there are two opposite-colored offsuits, they will be designated O1 and O2 where necessary.  When describing a hand, we will group the cards by suit.  Since the same principles apply no matter which suit is trump, we will often use T, N, O1, and O2 rather than specifying specific suits.  So, for example:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RLK-H, K10-S &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RLK-T, K10-O1 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

are the same, since it doesn't really matter that the suits are Hearts and Spades, but that it's Trump and one of the opposite-colored suite.


= Basic Playing Techniques/Tactics =

For the moment, we're going to assume that bidding has already taken place.  If you are new to the game, for now just bid intuitively based on whether or not you think you can win 3 tricks with the given suit as trump.  This section is about basic techniques for playing your cards out.

== What do I Lead? ==

If you're positioned in seat 1, you have the sometimes difficult choice of deciding what card to lead with.  Of course, every time you win a trick, you'll be faced with this same problem, but the very first lead is the hardest.  There are a few important things to consider when assessing your hand:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are any of these cards potential winners?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the odds that the other players are void in the suit I lead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If they are void, what are the odds that they trump in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are my trump cards going to win any tricks if trump gets led?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or do I have to trump in on other suits to win with my trump cards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Now, you have to weigh these considerations differently depending on whether you are a maker or a defender.  Before we begin to answer these questions, we need to take a quick diversion to understand a couple of crucially important principles.

== Winners, Losers, Voids, Leading, Trumping in and Pulling Trump ==

It is important to realize that there are basically up to 13 potential &quot;winners&quot; but only 5 tricks get played.  There are seven trump cards that can each win a trick and the 3 other suits each have a high card (usually the Ace) and the highest card remaining after that suit is led once.  Some of the trump can be in the kitty (but each suit will always have a high card) reducing the number of potential winners.  So there are 7 cards in players' hands that will never win--&quot;losers,&quot; 8 potential winners that don't win, and only 5 cards that do win.  Some cards are guaranteed winners, like the Right Bower.  The R can never, ever lose.  Aside from that, you're left trying to figure out how to make your potential winners actually win and how to get rid of your losers.  This all implies that lots of potential winners get beat by other, better winners.

=== Trumping In ===

One of the most common ways to ruin a potential winner is by trumping in.  Many times you will see an outside Ace get beaten by a trump card.  When a player is void in the suit led and plays a trump card instead, this is called trumping in.  This is how low trump cards go from being a potential winner to an actual winner and a primary way of turning other potential winners into losers.  Determining whether or not a player is likely to trump in on a trick is one of our primary considerations when choosing which card to lead, if you'll recall.  Setting yourself up to trump in on a following trick or having your partner trump in on this trick are both good things.  Having the opponents trump in and ruin your winner is obviously a bad thing.  How do you know what to expect?  Well, it's simple probability: the fewer cards the other players can possibly have, the more likely one of them has none.  How many could the other players have?  Well, that depends on how many are available and how many are in your hand!  Next only has 5 cards while the offsuits have 6.  If you have 3 cards in Next, then at least one of the other players must be void, with only 2 cards to divide amongst 3 players!

So if you want somebody to trump in, lead a card from one of your long suits (or Next if you don't have a long suit).  If you don't want anybody to trump in, lead a short suit (or an Offsuit if they're all the same).

==== Over Trumping ====

Another thing to keep in mind: once a player trumps in, another player might also have a void and play a higher trump card.  This is called over trumping.  You can even have 2 over trumps if all 3 players are void in the suit led!  Over-trumping is obviously very powerful because it eliminates multiple potential winners all at once.  From the perspective of choosing which card to lead, your main concern is that the final player will over-trump your partner.  It is vitally important that you keep track of whether or not each player has any trump remaining so as to anticipate trumping in and over-trumping.

=== Pulling Trump ===

Because of trump's ability to turn non-trump winners into losers, one of the most basic techniques in the game is to &quot;pull&quot; trump in order to make outside winners good, or make them &quot;stand.&quot;  If trump is led, then obviously each player must follow suit, but only the high trump wins.  This means that 3 trump can be wasted all in one go, preventing them from trumping in on other tricks!

=== Getting the Lead Back and Following Suit ===

If all the trump is gone, then the highest card of the suit led will win.  This means that leading is extremely valuable, because if the other players are unable to follow suit, their potential winners are useless.  It also means that your potential winners will be useless if you can't get the lead back!  You get the lead back by trumping in or if somebody leads to your winners.  Obviously, you and your partner work to capitalize on each other's winners and prevent your opponents from leading, but it doesn't always work out this way.

== So what do I lead again? ==

With the preliminaries out of the way, you can now try and decide between these choices:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead a winner because I'll never get another chance to lead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save my winner because I think I'll get the lead back later when trump is gone, making my winner good.&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead trump, pulling trump, to try and make my winners good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull trump to make my partner's winners good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead a singleton loser so I can trump in on a later trick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead a loser from a long suit hoping my partner trumps in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead another loser because I believe my partner has the Ace or can trump in based on his previous discards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== What do I discard? ==

When you don't lead, can't follow suit, and can't or don't want to trump in, what do you discard?  This is one of the most vital things to know: if at all possible, discard a card from the suit that you want your partner to lead back to you.  For example, say your partner leads with an Ace and you're void.  You don't want to trump in because his Ace is winning.  So instead you discard a singleton that you have, giving you a void.  Now, if your partner leads that suit (after winning with the Ace) you will be able to trump in.  Alternatively, if you have an Ace and a 9 of a given suit, discard the 9 and your partner can lead back to your Ace, letting you win the trick.  This also shows that you need to pay attention to your partner's discards!

= General Bidding Principles/Strategy =

Sometimes bidding is easy--you obviously have enough winners to take 3 tricks and so you can just order it up.  But the most fundamental difference between mediocre and good Euchre players lies in proper bidding much more than how the cards play out.  The goal, of course, is to order up every hand that you can win and to prevent your opponents from doing the same, where possible.  There are 2 levels to Euchre bidding: simple bid-what-you-think-you-can-win and bidding strategically.

All of Euchre strategy revolves around 6 points:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Lonering gives a disproportionate number of points for winning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The dealer must pick trump suit and his or her team be the makers if everybody else passes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If you have a really bad hand, your opponents probably have a good hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; If your partner also has a bad hand, then you're screwed no matter what.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; As a corollary to #3, if you have a bad hand and don't call trump, your opponent almost certainly will.  And they'll make it, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Pay attention to the score, dummy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Because succeeding alone gives 4 points vs just 2 points for taking all 5 tricks together, loners change the face of the game.  Calling loners and preventing your opponents from calling loners are extremely important.  Beginning players are far too timid regarding the former and don't even think about the latter.  Since the dealer can get stuck calling trump, sometimes you order up trump not so much because you like what you have, but because you want to avoid getting stuck with something &quot;worse.&quot;  If you have a really bad hand, then your opponents probably have a good hand.  If your partner also has a bad hand, then you're really screwed.  Since your opponents will certainly win 1 point if they call trump, and likely  take all 5 tricks for 2 or 4 points, sometimes you call your best suit as trump to maximize your hand's potential, figuring that if you're set, you were going to give up those points (or more) anyway.  Finally, pay attention to the score!  If your opponents have 9 points, then you don't have to worry about being set--take your best shot!  You will see these principles discussed and used much more in the advanced sections of the book.  For now, though, we're going to get on with the more basic bid-what-you-think-you-can-win.

== Offensive Bidding ==

A basic guideline: If you think you are virtually guaranteed to win 2 tricks and have a shot at 3 based on what's in your hand, you should order it up.  In most cases, your partner will win a trick or your 3rd winner will come through.

== Glossary of Common Euchre Terms ==
Note:  Some terms are regional but the use of each one has been verified by the crack research staff at the [http://euchreuniverse.blogspot.com/ Euchre Universe].  

Alone – Term said when a player wishes to play the round against the opponents without help from her partner.  See Going Alone

Assist – To order up your partner when she is the dealer; ordering from the power seat 

At the bridge – In a 10-point game, it’s when a team has scored 9 points and is only 1 away from winning the game.  Also called In the Barn.

Bagger – A player who uses the strategy of bagging.

Bagging - This is when your opponent is dealing, you have a good hand, but you pass.  You are hoping they’ll pick it up and then you can euchre them.  This is also known as &quot;passing dirty.&quot;  If you do it, you are known as the “bagger.&quot;  It’s not such a great strategy unless you are sitting in the weak seat (third from the dealer).

Bowers – The Jacks of the trump suit.  The Right Bower is the highest card and it is the Jack of the trump suit.  The Left Bower is the second-highest card and it is the Jack of the suit that is same color as the trump (the “next” suit).

Bubbles – Cutesy name for the Hearts suit

Columbus Coup – Term coined by Natty Bumpo to refer to the &quot;Donation&quot; strategy.

Dealer – The player who distributes the cards on any given round.

Diamantez – Cutesy name for the Diamonds suit

Discard – The card that the dealer gets rid of into the “kitty” (or talon) when picking up the trump card.

Donation – This is a defensive strategy in which you order up knowing full well that you will probably get euchred.  Your intent is to concede 2 points to the opponents, hoping to prevent a 4-point loner.

Doubleton - Having only two cards in a certain suit

Exposed card – This is a card that has been turned face-up accidentally.  Technically, it is supposed to remain that way and played at the first legal opportunity.

Farmer’s Hand – A hand which contains only Tens and Nines.  In some euchre circles being dealt a farmer’s hand would result in a re-deal.  

First Round – The round of ordering that starts immediately after the cards are dealt and the up-card is turned.

Going Alone – This is a situation in which one member of the partnership orders up trump and says “alone.&quot;  That player’s partner puts her hand down and is relegated to watching the action and sweeping the tricks.  She is allowed to sweep so she feels like she’s part of the game.  Getting all the tricks on a loner will net your team 4 points.  Getting 3 or 4 tricks results in 1 point and getting euchred results in 2 points for your opponents.

Green – This is a term used to mean the wrong color.  In euchre there are certain conventions that snooty, backwoods players expect you to follow.  If you are sitting first chair, you are supposed to call the “next” suit.  If you call suit that is not next, you are calling the “wrong” suit or the &quot;green&quot; suit.  For example, if Spades is trump, the green suits would be Hearts and Diamonds.  

Hook – A common term for a Jack.  (The J looks a bit like a hook, right?)  You will often hear people calling for a “hook” to be turned over when they are dealing.

Horse – The 6 card used for scorekeeping

&quot;In the barn&quot; – This means a team has scored 9 points in a 10-point game and is one away from victory.  Also known as 
&quot;at the bridge.&quot;

Kibitzing –  Saying something that reveals information about your hand or indicates what your partner should play.  For example, telling your partner not to trump your ace or to lead a certain suit is illegal kibitzing.  There are forms of legal kibitzing such as saying “alone” or  “stay home.&quot;   Also known as table talk.  

Kitty – These are the 4 cards that remain after everyone’s been dealt his or her 5 cards.  The top card of the kitty is flipped over, becoming the up-card, and is used during the first round of bidding.  If someone orders it up, the dealer gets to discard one of her cards with the top card of the kitty.  The remaining 3 kitty cards are never used in play.  Kitty is a controversial term, as some euchre purists do not believe it is technically correct.  Talon is the more “correct” term, but language evolves and while kitty may not have been correct in the past, so many players use it to refer to the remaining dead cards that it warrants inclusion in this work.

Knock – This is a hand signal used when a player wants to pass.  One could say “knock” but it’s much classier to actually knock on the playing surface.  Of course, no one ever said euchre was a classy game.

Lay-down loner – A hand that is so good that it will definitely be able to win all the tricks. The hand consists of 5 trump headed by the two bowers and the Ace. To be safe you would have to play the three high cards (in any order) first in order to draw out all the other players' trump cards, so it is customary to arrange the cards in such an order prior to engaging in the expedient of laying them all down at once. Also known as a no-brainer.
 
Leading – The action of laying out the first card of a trick.  The person in the first seat left of the dealer gets the privilege of leading any card to start the game.  All subsequent tricks are led by the winner of the previous trick.

Left Bower – The Jack of the suit that is the same color as the trump suit.  It is the second highest ranking card in the deck.

Lone Ace – An ace in your hand in a suit in which you have no other cards.  More generally called a singleton.  

Make the hand – To order trump and win at least 3 of the 5 tricks.

Maker – the player who establishes the trump suit by ordering up in the first round or naming trump in the second round of bidding.

March – This is when your team gets all the tricks and scores 2 points (or 4 if it’s a loner).  This is also known as a sweep.  

Next – Refers to the suit that is the same color as the up-turned card.  It is a common strategy to order up “next” from seat 1 in the second round of bidding.  This makes sense because it’s likely that the dealer does not have a bower of that color.

No-brainer – Also known as a lay-down loner, this is a hand where the cards are so strong that no one else will win a trick (e.g., having a 5-trump hand with the Right and Left bowers).

Passing Dirty – This is when your opponent is dealing, you have a good hand, but you pass.  You are hoping they’ll pick it up and then you can euchre them.  This is also known as “bagging,&quot; and if you do it, you are known as the “bagger.&quot;  It’s not such a great strategy unless you are sitting in the weak seat.

Paying Al - Term used by Chicago euchre players to refer to the &quot;Donation&quot; strategy.

Pips – The symbols on the cards indicating the suit.  In a standard deck these are clubs, diamonds, spades, and hearts.  In one Christmas deck the pips are snowmen, trees, elves and santas.  Go figure.

Power Seat – The player sitting in the second seat left of the dealer.  The dealer’s partner.

Promotion – Increasing the power of a lower card in any suit.  This occurs when any of the higher cards are played on an earlier trick.  For example, if you have the Left Bower and the Right Bower is played on an earlier trick, the Left is “promoted” to the highest ranked card.

Puppy paws – Cutesy name for Clubs

Right Bower – The highest ranking card in the deck.  It is the Jack of the Trump suit.

Renege – This is when a player fails to play a card from the suit led even though they have one.   When and if discovered, the non-offending team receives the maximum possible number of points for that deal, usually 2 points.  You are allowed to correct a renege as long as the next trick isn’t played.  Since euchre is such a fast-paced game, some “creative” players will try to use reneging as a winning strategy.  It works well against opponents who don’t pay attention much. You must dispute it before hand is over and you must be able to prove what card was thrown. Once cards are shuffled a Renege is null and void.  Also called revoke.

Revoke – Same as renege. 

Rider – The 4 card used for scorekeeping

Ruff – To play a trump card on a trick that was led with a suit in which you are void.  This is the type of play that allows the lowly 9 of trump to beat a mighty non-trump Ace.

Screw the dealer – (Stick The Dealer, STD).  This is an optional rule in which the dealer is not allowed to pass a second time.  She is required to order something up except the suit of the turned down card.  This rule has the effect of speeding up the game as points are scored on every deal.

Second Round – The round of ordering that starts immediately after each player has passed once and the up-card is turned down.  

Shake the bushes – this is a strategy where you lead trump.  It usually refers to the first trick.  If your team made trump then leading it is usually a good play.  If you are the defending team, leading trump is less often a good play.

Shift – In the world of card manipulation (legerdemain) this is the act of reversing a cut thus putting the cards back the way they started.  Highly effective and easy to pull off with a small euchre deck.  Some shifty euchre players do this all the time.

Shovels – Cutesy name for Spades

Singleton – This means having only one card in a given suit.  When it’s the Ace, you call it the lone Ace.  

Skunk – When you beat your opponents (or in the unbelievable event that they beat you) 10-0.  In some euchre leagues where points count towards season placing you can score up to 13 points by making a loner when your team has 9 points.  In some circles, 5 points is a game and a skunk would then be winning 5-0.

Squeeze Play – A strategy in which you force your opponent to choose between two equally good cards to throw away.  It is an offensive strategy often employed when going alone.

Stay home – this is what you do when your partner opts to go alone.  Used in context it would go something like this.  “I’m going alone, partner, so you can just stay home.&quot;

Steal the deal – A common ploy in which a player attempts to deal when it’s his opponent’s turn.  In most euchre circles this is a perfectly acceptable form of cheating.  Against drunk and sober folks alike this trick is pretty easy to pull off.  And the advantage is HUGE!!  The dealing team wins the round about 70% of the time.  So get your opponents chatting and gather up the cards for yourself.  According to euchre rules, once the deal is complete (trump card is turned up), it is a legal deal and you’ve successfully stolen the deal.

Sweeper – The player that picks up the winning tricks for his side.  In some partnerships, one person sweeps all the tricks whenever his team wins and the other partner keeps score.

Table talk – Saying something that reveals information about your hand or indicates what your partner should play.  For example, telling your partner not to trump your ace or to lead a certain suit is illegal table talk.  Some also call this “kibitzing.&quot;  

Talon – The more accurate term for the 4 cards left over after the hands of a euchre game have been dealt.  It is more commonly referred to as the Kitty.

Throw off – To play a card that is not the suit led but is also not trump.

Trick – Four cards put face-up on the table during a single turn.  The winner of the trick is the person who laid the highest ranking card in the suit led or trump.  He collects all the cards in the trick, lays them face down, and leads a card for the next trick.  A single trick is one-fifth of a game.

Trump – The suit that is the highest in a game of euchre.  The smallest card in this suit (9 of trump) will beat the highest card in any different suit.  Trump is determined by the up-card in the first round or the declared suit in the second round.

Trumping – Playing a trump card on a trick in which a different suit was led.  Also known as “ruffing,&quot; this play requires that you do not have a card in the led suit.  Since any trump is higher than any non-trump, this card will usually win the trick.  That is unless someone trumps higher.  

Up-card – the card that gets flipped from the remaining four (called either the Kitty or the Talon) that determines the first suit that can be named trump. If everyone passes, the up-card is turned down and a different suit must be named trump or the cards are re-dealt.

Void – Not having any cards in a given suit.  It is useful to be void in a non-trump suit as it allows you to ruff a high card with a small trump.

Weak Seat – The player sitting in the chair that is third from the left of dealer.  

Wrong Suit – The &quot;green&quot; suit; the suit that is not the next suit; the one that is the opposite color of the turned-down trump suit.

== 1. Be able to label a diagram or a model of a human brain including the following parts and tell briefly what each part does:==

== 2. What is a neuron? Draw a picture of a typical neuron and label its parts. Where does information enter a neuron and where does information leave from?==

[[image:Neuron.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Drawing of a Typical Neuron]]

Neurons (also called nerve cells) are a major class of cells in the nervous system. In vertebrates, they are found in the brain, the spinal cord and elsewhere in the nervous system.  Their primary role is to process and transmit neural information. One important characteristic of neurons is that they can generate and propagate electrical signals.

Neurons are discrete cells which communicate with each other via specialized junctions. Information enters the neuron primarily through the '''dendrites''' and exits through the '''axon'''.  

Neurons communicate with one another and to other cells through synapses, where the axon terminal of one cell connects to a dendrite of another.
{{clear}}

== 3. Explain how drugs affect the function of neurons especially at the 'synapse'. Make a commitment never to take drugs except for medical reasons.==
Axons carry electrical signals from a neuron to the dendrite of another neuron.  However, an axon cannot transmit these electrical signals directly to a dendrite - it needs a synapse to do this.  The synapse converts the electrical impulse to a chemical reaction, which releases different types of chemicals called ''neurotransmitters.''  These neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and cause other chemical reactions which generate electricity in the dendrite.  

The synapses can be &quot;trained&quot; to react strongly, weakly, anywhere in between, or not at all.  It is because they can adapt that we are able to learn new things, form habits (good or bad), or suffer from addictions.

Many drugs affect the way the synapse does its job by preventing the neurotransmitter chemicals from traveling across the synapse.  Drugs can also amplify these reactions, so that they are more intense than they would have been in the absence of the drug.

== 4. What is a reflex? Perform a knee-jerk reflex test on someone.  Explain why it occurs (use the following terms in your answer: sensory neuron, motor neuron, spinal cord). Why do doctors use this test in a physical exam?==
Instructions: Gently tap someone just below the knee-cap while the person's leg is hanging over the edge of a chair.

A simple reflex is entirely automatic and involves no learning.  An example is the escape reflex (e.g., the sudden withdrawal of a hand in response to a pain stimulus), or the patellar reflex (the jerking of a leg when the kneecap is tapped). Sensory neurons in the stimulated body part sends a signal to the spinal cord. Within the spinal cord a reflex arc switches the signal straight back to the muscles of the body (in this case the arm or the leg) to a motor neuron; contraction of the muscle occurs (the arm or leg jerks upwards). Only three nerve cells are involved, and the brain is only aware of the response after it has taken place. 

The deep tendon reflexes provide information on how well of the central and peripheral nervous systems are working. Generally, decreased reflexes indicate a problem in the peripheral nervous system.  Lively or exaggerated reflexes indicate a problem in the central nervous system.

== 5. What is a sensory neuron, and what is &quot;adaptation&quot;. ==
'''Sensory neurons''' are nerve cells within the nervous system responsible for converting external stimuli from the organism's environment into internal electrical impulses. For example, some sensory neurons respond to tactile stimuli and can activate motor neurons in order to achieve muscle contraction. Such connections between sensory and motor neurons underlie motor reflex loops and several forms of involuntary behavior, including pain avoidance. In humans, such reflex circuits are commonly located in the spinal cord.

'''Neural adaptation''' is a change over time in the responsiveness of the sensory system to a constant stimulus. It is usually experienced as a change in the stimulus. For example, if you rest your hand on a table, you immediately feel the table's surface on your skin. Within a few seconds, however, you cease to feel the table's surface. The sensory neurons stimulated by the table's surface respond immediately, but then respond less and less until they may not respond at all; this is neural adaptation.

===Demonstrate adaption by doing the following: Rest your arm on a table and then place a small cork (or something very light) on your arm. ===
Notice how it feels at that time and how it feels one minute later after not moving.

=== Place one finger of one hand in a bowl of cool water and another finger of the other hand into a bowl of warm water.===
After 30 seconds, put both fingers in to a bowl of water at room temperature. How does the water at room temperature feel on each finger?

=== What spiritual lesson can be drawn from the concept of adaptation?===
Just as the sensory system can adapt to a stimulus until it no longer even notices it, we can adapt to a sinful environment until ''we'' no longer notice the sin.  The conscience becomes numbed when ignored.  We must be careful about the sorts of stimuli we allow ourselves to be subject to.  Watching television programs that promote sin will dull our senses to the enormous evil of sin just as a constant stimulus to the skin will dull our perception to it.

== 6. How are the senses of taste and smell similar and how are they different.==
'''Draw a map of which part of the tongue responds to the following tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salt. Instructions: Have someone dip a Q-tip into one of the following: sugar water (for sweet), lemon juice (for sour), flat tonic water (bitter) or salty water (salt), and then lightly touch different parts of your tongue. Notice which areas of the tongue taste the solution that is being tested. Rinse with pure water between each test and use a new Q-tip for each test.'''

Both the sense of taste and the sense of smell detect the chemical composition of a substance through ''chemoreceptors.''  Taste is detected by the tongue in solids and in liquids, while smell is detected by the nose in airborn substances.

There is much debate in the scientific community as to whether the &quot;taste map&quot; is a real phenomenon or not.  Those who espouse the theory say that sweetness is best detected at the tip of the tongue, bitterness at the back of the tongue, saltiness at the sides of the tongue, and sourness further back along the sides of the tongue.  Those who dismiss the theory say that each of these tastes can be detected on all regions of the tongue, and that the &quot;taste map&quot; is based on a misinterpretation of a German medical paper by a Harvard psychology student in 1901.  Try the experiment yourself as outlined in the requirement and draw your own conclusions.

== 7. Draw a picture of the various parts of the eye and explain why you have a blind-spot. Find your blind-spot for one eye. ==

[[image:Schematic_diagram_of_the_human_eye.svg|thumb|400px|Schematic Diagram of the Human Eye. a:optic nerve, b:optic disc, c:sclera, d:choroid, e:retina, f:zonular fibres, g:posterior chamber, h:iris, i:pupil, j:cornea, k:anterior chamber (filled with aqueous humour), l:ciliary muscle, m:lens, n:suspensory ligament, o:vitreous humour, p:fovea]]

'''Instructions: Place a very small black dot on the center of a white piece of paper. Close one eye and stare directly ahead. Hold the paper at arms length in front of you and move the paper until the spot &quot;disappears&quot; (usually this is occurs when the dot is just a bit below eye level - it is important).'''

The retina is a thin layer of cells at the back of the eyeball; it is the part of the eye which converts light into nervous signals.

The retina contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) which receive the light; the resulting neural signals then undergo complex processing by other neurons of the retina, and are further processed in the retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve. The retina not only detects light, it also plays a significant part in visual perception.

The optic disc is a point on the retina where the optic nerve pierces it to connect to the nerve cells inside the retina. No photosensitive cells exist at this point, and it is therefore &quot;blind&quot;.

== 8. Describe the three basic parts of the ear and tell what each part does. Explain why the following activities can be bad for your hearing: listening to a &quot;walkman&quot;, putting something long in your ear, being in the front row at a loud music concert, not treating an ear infection properly, standing behind a jet at an airport==
[[image:HumanEar.jpg|thumb|400px|Anatomy of the Human Ear]]
The three basic parts of the ear are the '''outer ear''', '''middle ear''', and '''inner ear'''.

* The '''outer ear''' is the external portion of the ear and includes the eardrum.  The pinna, which is the external portion of the ear, captures the sound and transfers them through the auditory canal to the eardrum, which vibrates and transfers the sound to the tiny bones in the middle ear.

* The '''middle ear''' includes the ossicles (three tiny bones), two muscle tendons, and two nerve bundles. The Eustachian tube connects from the chamber of the middle ear to the back of the pharynx to equalize the pressure. That's why you can feel your ears &quot;pop&quot; when descending on an airplane.

* The '''inner ear''' comprises both the organ of hearing (the cochlea) and the labyrinth or vestibular apparatus, the organ of balance located in the inner ear that consists of three semicircular canals and the vestibule. Within the cochlea are located three canals: the tympanic canal, the vestibular canal, and the middle canal. When sound strikes the cochlea, the fluid inside is moved. This fluid stimulates the organ of Corti, located within the middle canal, to interpret the sound and send the information through the auditory nerve to the brain.

'''Causes of Hearing Loss'''
===Listening to a &quot;walkman&quot;===
Personal electronic audio devices, such as Walkmans and iPods (iPods often reaching 115 decibels or higher), can produce powerful enough sound to cause significant Noise-Induced Hearing Loss, even though lesser intensities of even 70 decibels can also cause hearing loss.

===Putting something long in your ear===
Putting something long into your ear can easily puncture the eardrum.  True is the saying that you should never put anything smaller than your elbow into your ear! 

===Being in the front row at a loud music concert===
As in the case of the &quot;walkman&quot; question, exposure to loud sounds can damage your hearing.  Live music concerts are an even greater threat to the hearing because they are so much louder than a personal electronic device, even when the listener is ''not'' close to the speakers.  

===Not treating an ear infection properly===
An ear infection causes tissues inside the ear to swell, and this can close the tubes inside.  When the tubes are blocked, pressure in the ear does not equalize, and that makes it more difficult for the eardrum to vibrate.  This causes a reduction in hearing.  In severe cases, the pressure imbalance can cause the eardrum to tear.

===Standing behind a jet at an airport===
As in the case of the loud concert, very loud noises - even brief ones - can cause severe damage to the ear, including tearing the eardrum and damaging the hair cells in the inner ear.

== 9. Do one or more of the following activities: (some of these activities will need to be planned with a medical/dental professional or at a local college or university— they are usually very willing to assist you)==
=== Observe an electroencephalogram or one being performed on someone and describe what can be learned from this test.===
[[image:1st-eeg.png|frame|left|The first EEG recording, obtained by Hans Berger in 1929.]]

This is the output recorded by the first electroencephalogram (EEG) administered by Hans Berger in 1929.  Electroencephalography is the measurement of the electrical activity of the brain by recording from electrodes placed on the scalp or, in special cases, on the cortex.  The resulting traces are known as an electroencephalogram (EEG) and represent so-called brainwaves.  This device is used to assess brain damage, epilepsy and other problems. In some jurisdictions it is used to assess brain death.

=== Watch a &quot;lie-detector&quot; test being performed. Briefly explain how one works.===
A polygraph or lie detector is a device which measures and records several physiological variables such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiration and skin conductivity while a series of questions is being asked, in an attempt to detect lies.

A typical polygraph starts with a pre-test interview designed to establish a connection (or find a control) between the tester and the testee and to gain some preliminary information which will later be used for &quot;Control Questions &quot; or C (see below). Then the tester will explain the polygraph, emphasizing that it can detect lies and that it is important to answer truthfully. Then a &quot;stim test&quot; is often conducted: the testee is asked to deliberately lie and then the tester reports that he was able to detect this lie. Then the actual test starts. Some of the questions asked are &quot;Irrelevant &quot; or IR(&quot;Are you 35 years old?&quot;), others are &quot;probable-lie&quot; Control Questions that most people will lie about (&quot;Have you ever stolen money?&quot;) and the remainder are the &quot;Relevant Questions &quot; or R the polygrapher is really interested in. The different types of questions alternate. The test is passed if the physiological responses during the probable-lie control questions are larger than those during the relevant questions. These admissions are the main goal of the test.

There is a close relation with the hypnotic phenomena, the buildup of expectancy, the assumed authority of the tester, the environmental constrains and the sequences of questions all guide the testee into believing the process. In case of inconclusive results (or even against expected outcome), the tester may attempts to elicit admissions during a post-test interview (&quot;Your situation will only get worse if we don't clear this up&quot;).

The accuracy of polygraph tests is a matter of considerable controversy. While some claim the test to be accurate in 70% - 90% of the cases, critics charge that rather than a &quot;test&quot;, the method amounts to an inherently unstandardizable interrogation technique whose accuracy cannot be established. Critics also argue that even given high estimates of the polygraph's accuracy a significant number of subjects (e.g. %10 given a %90 accuracy) will appear to be lying, and would unfairly suffer the consequences of &quot;failing&quot; the polygraph. It is interesting to note that, so far, not one scientific study has been published that proves the validity of the polygraph test. Polygraph tests have also been criticized for failing to trap known spies such as Aldrich Ames, who passed two polygraph tests while spying for the Russian government.

=== Observe an MRI or one being performed and explain what information can be learned from such a test.===
=== Observe a neuron under a microscope.===
=== Observe someone receiving a local or general anesthetic and explain how an anesthetic works.===
Perhaps the easiest place to do this is at a dentist's office.  If you have ever had a cavity filled, the dentist very likely administered a local anesthetic.

=== Observe a real human brain (fresh or preserved)===
== 10. List at least 5 things that you can do to protect your brain from damage.==
#'''Wear a helmet.''' Many work and recreational activities can subject a person to head injury.  It is best to not take chances - wear a helmet when it's called for!  Do not enter a hard-hat area without a hardhat.  Put on your helmet ''every'' time you ride your bike, go rock climbing, play football, or paddle a kayak.  Why risk it?  
#'''Exercise your brain.''' The more you use your brain, the better it works.  The saying &quot;practice makes perfect&quot; is very true.  Any activity that involves the brain can be improved with practice.
#'''Get plenty of fresh air.''' Your brain needs oxygen.  
#'''Say &quot;No&quot; to drugs.''' Most of the illegal &quot;street drugs&quot; are popular because they affect the way people feel.  The only way they can do this is by affecting the brain, and these effects are never harmless.  Drugs can do permanent damage to the brain.
#'''Eat healthy food.''' Junk foods cloud the brain.  Healthy foods are just as good for the brain as they are for the body.

== 11. Do one of the following:==
=== Visit and help care for someone (minimum of 2 hrs) who has a disease of the brain and report on their special needs.===
=== Briefly describe the following disorders of the nervous system:===
==== Alzheimer's Disease====
Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease of the  brain.  It is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by progressive intellectual deterioration together with declining activities of daily living and behavioral changes. The most striking early symptom is memory loss (amnesia), usually in the form of minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily worse as the illness progresses, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, intellectual impairment extends to language, coordinated movement, recognition  and functions such as decision-making and planning. 
==== Multiple Sclerosis====
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. MS can cause a variety of symptoms, including changes in sensation, visual problems, muscle weakness, depression, and difficulties with coordination and speech. Although many patients lead full and rewarding lives, MS can cause impaired mobility and disability in the more severe cases.

Multiple sclerosis affects neurons, the cells of the brain and spinal cord that carry information, create thought and perception and allow the brain to control the body.

==== Epilepsy ====
Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures.  It has  been described as electrical storms in the brain's circuitry.

All the causes of epilepsy are not known, but many predisposing factors have been identified, including brain damage resulting from malformations during brain development, head trauma, neurosurgical operations, other penetrating wounds of the brain, brain tumor, high fever, bacterial or viral encephalitis, stroke, intoxication, or acute or inborn disturbances of metabolism. 

==== Major Depression ====
Major depression is a state of sadness or melancholia that has advanced to the point of being disruptive to an individual's social functioning and/or activities of daily living.  It is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain.

==== Down Syndrome====
Down syndrome encompasses a number of chromosomal abnormalities causing highly variable degrees of learning difficulties as well as physical disabilities.  While most children with Down syndrome have a lower than average cognitive function, some have earned college degrees, and nearly all will learn to read, write and do simple mathematics.

==== Huntington's Disease====
Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited disorder characterized by abnormal body movements called chorea, and a reduction of various mental abilities.  Symptoms of the disorder include loss of cognitive ability (thinking, speaking), changes in personality, jerking movements of the face and body in general and unsteady walking. These symptoms develop into dementia and cognitive decline, and an advanced form of rapid jerking.

==== Quadriplegic====  
Quadriplegia is a symptom in which a human experiences partial or complete paralysis from the neck down.  It is caused by damage to the brain or to the spinal cord at a high level. The injury causes the victim to lose total or partial use of the arms and legs.

==== Paraplegic ====
Paraplegia is a condition in which the lower part of a patient's body is paralyzed and cannot move. It is usually the result of spinal cord injury or a congenital condition such as spina bifida.

== 12. Find at least three references from the Bible that refer to your brain and/or to decisions that you make in life. ==
An excellent place to find Biblical references on making decisions is Week 23 of the weekly AY reading assignments (required for Companions and Voyagers):
* '''Luke 14'''
* '''Matthew 4'''
* '''Mark 8'''
* '''Matthew 16'''
* '''2 Corinthians 7:1'''
* '''1 Peter 1:13-16'''
* '''1 Thessalonians 4:3-8'''

Currently, this wiki is largely based on an older version of the Wings 3D manual, which having been written in 2003, is considerably out of date and filled with extraneous material. Please help us improve this unofficial wiki manual by removing clutter and updating entries to reflect the latest information.

All the original material from the official manual will be eventually removed, and then the above copyright notice can be removed.

The 2003 manual does a very good job of giving brief and concise explanations of features. For this reason, it is being used as the basis for this wiki. If anyone would like to help out, there is an icon in adobe acrobat that turns the mouse pointer into a cursor that you can highlight .pdf text to copy and paste.

'''Latest Version of [http://www.wings3d.com Wings 3D]'''

* '''Stable: 1.4.1''' with features accepted as permanent
* '''Development: 1.4.43''' with many updated and [http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=33028&amp;release_id=686139 powerful new features] 

This manual reflects content in Wings 3D ver. '''0.98.10d'''

== Installing Wings ==
Wings3D is written in the [[w:Erlang_programming_language|Erlang programming language]]. The Erlang binaries needed for Wings are compiled into the Wings distribution.

A list of currently-available plugins can be found [[Wings 3D/User Manual/Plugins|here]]. Note that plugins don’t necessarily work with every version of Wings3D; a given plugin might only work with a particular update.

If you're interested in developing for Wings, you'll need to download the full Erlang distribution. You can download both the Wings3D binaries and Erlang source and runtime libraries for Windows from the [http://www.wings3d.com/ Wings home page].

== User Interface ==
[[File:Wings_legend.png|right]]
[[File:Wings3d_UM_Overview1.png|thumb|The Wings3D program window|400px|right]]

Wings3D opens with an empty '''geometry window''' (or '''workspace''') at its core. Above the geometry window are the '''title bar''', the '''menu bar''', the '''tool bar''', and the '''status bar'''. At the bottom of the window is the '''information line'''. The rest of the user interface is accessed via context-sensitive menus called up via clicking the '''right mouse button''' over the workspace. 

The title bar along the top of the application window identifies the program's name. At the far right of the Title Bar are the standard GUI widgets for Minimize, Restore, and Close. If a previously saved file is open in Wings 3D, the title bar will display its file name. When a file is auto-saved, the title bar displays that the file has been auto-saved.

=== Geometry Window ===
The main window in Wings 3D is the '''geometry window'''. This is where your work is displayed and worked on.

=== Menu Bar ===
At the top of the Geometry window is the menu bar. This is where you will find general options in Wings that are not specific to any one Selection Mode. The menus are as follows:

* [[/The File Menu/]]
* [[/The Edit Menu/]]
* [[/The View Menu/]]
* [[/The Select Menu/]]
* [[/The Tools Menu/]]
* [[/The Window Menu/]]
* [[/The Help Menu/]]

=== The Toolbar ===
The toolbar is a feature within the Geometry window, below the menu bar. It provides one-click access to saving/loading, undo/redo, selection type, general preferences, and scene view options.

Clicking an empty section of the toolbar will deselect any selected elements.

It can be hidden by placing the mouse over the Geometry window title bar and clicking the right mouse button and selecting '''Hide Toolbar''' from the pop-up menu. To reveal a hidden toolbar, right-click the title bar and select '''Show Toolbar'''.

==== Toolbar Buttons ====
* '''Vertex''' - switches to '''vertex mode'''
** Clicking the ''Vertex Icon'' when in another selection mode will transform your current selection to its equivalent as ''Vertices''
** Clicking the ''Vertex Icon'' with a vertex selection already made will &quot;grow&quot; the selection

* '''Edge''' - switches to '''edge mode'''
** Clicking the ''Edge Icon'' when in another selection mode will transform your current selection to its equivalent as ''Edges''
** Clicking the ''Edge Icon'' with an edge selection already made will &quot;grow&quot; the selection

* '''Face''' - switches to '''face mode'''
** Clicking the ''Face Icon'' when in another selection mode will transform your current selection to its equivalent as ''Faces''
** Clicking the ''Face Icon'' with a face selection already made will &quot;grow&quot; the selection

* '''Object''' - switches to '''object/body mode'''
** Clicking the ''object/Body Icon'' when in another selection mode will select the entire object


----
''Note that growing the selection using the toolbar icons does not grow the selection in the same way that '''Select|More''' submenu in the '''menu bar''' does.''
----


* '''Preferences''' - opens the preferences window
* '''Shaded Preview''' - toggles between '''smooth''' and '''flat''' view mode
* '''Orthographic/Perspective View''' - toggles between '''orthographic view''' and '''perspective view'''
** ''Orthographic View'' shows models in two dimensions. In this mode, lines are not subject to foreshortening like they are in perspective view. Therefore, in a scene with two identical objects the object furthest away from the camera still appears to have the same dimensions as the object closest to the camera. This is useful for certain operations like moving elements only on the plane that the camera is facing with '''Move|Free''' or '''Tools|Tweak Mode'''. It is also useful in some '''Tools|Connect Mode''' operations.
** ''Perspective View'' shows the model in three dimensions and gives the impression that certain elements of the geometry are further away than others. This is often the ideal viewing mode for most modeling operations because this is how objects appear to us in the real world. 
* '''Show/Hide Grid''' - toggles the '''grid''' on and off
* '''Show/Hide Axes''' - toggles the X, Y and Z '''axes''' on or off

=== The Status Bar ===
The status bar changes automatically to display relevant information about selected elements or helpful comments during complex modeling operations. Keeping an eye on the status bar is important as it gives you valuable information about the status of an operation while manipulating elements of geometry. It displays this information in '''degrees(°)''' for rotations, as a '''percentage(%)''' during scale operations, and in '''distances(D)''' for movements in Wings' internal distance units (wu).

=== The Workspace ===
In the Workspace itself are the three main axes which are conveniently labeled X, Y, and Z. It is customary to think in terms of X as being the right and left, Y the up and down and Z the front and back of a model. Many of the commands are axis-specific in operation, working around these global axes or around local axes parallel to them. Display colors for each axis are by defauld set to '''X: red, Y: green, Z: blue''', but you can assign axis colors according to your preference.

A grid is centered at the world's origin point. This grid is useful for measuring the objects you create. It uses Wings world units, which are an arbitrary size that you can use to represent any scale you want, i.e. inches, feet, etc.

=== The Information Line ===
The '''information line''' runs along the bottom of the main Wings window. This is probably the most important thing to keep your eye on, ''especially'' if you are new to Wings. The information line's main purpose is to display every possible button option available for the currently highlighted or active ''operation'', ''tool'', or ''menu item''. Many of the tools and menu options have more than one function, and some of the more advanced options are only displayed in the information line. To display any menu item's possible options or described function, simply hover over the item with the mouse cursor. 

The information line uses the letters '''L''', '''M''' and '''R''' for the left, middle and right mouse buttons, respectively. When several options are available for a tool, menu item, or during an operation, those options are displayed in the information line preceded by L, M, or R. Sometimes the user will be prompted to depress a '''modifier key''' in conjunction with the designated mouse button. The typical modifier keys are ''control &lt;Ctrl&gt;'', ''&lt;Alt&gt;'', or ''&lt;Shift&gt;'', or sometimes a combination of two or more are used with the mouse buttons. There are other instances when numeric or other keys are used to toggle options. In cases where numeric keys are used to change the result of a command, '''do not use the numeric keypad'''. For numeric key modifiers displayed in the information line, use the numeric keys across the top of your keyboard instead.

=== Dialog Boxes ===
'''Dialog boxes''' are used to enter values via the keyboard as parameters for operations in Wings. Some dialog boxes pop up when the user chooses to enter a value numerically and other pop up automatically asking the user to enter a value before proceeding.

==== Tab Entry Dialog Box ====
The most common dialog boxes in Wings is the '''tab entry dialog box'''. Perhaps that's not its official name, but it serves as a pretty apt description. Pressing '''&lt;tab&gt;''' during most types of operations that involve ''scaling'', ''moving'', ''rotating'', or ''extruding'' elements of geometry invokes this dialog box. The information line will tell you when this option is available. When the user presses '''&lt;tab&gt;''' during such an operation, the tab entry dialog box will open with the present value of the operation already entered, ready for the user to edit.

The benefit to using the tab entry dialog box is that you can apply very precise transformations to operations that would be very difficult or impossible by mouse-dragging.

==== Math In Dialog Boxes ====
There's an interesting feature to this dialog box that's not apparent at first glance. Wings understands most of the common mathematical expressions including addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*) and division(/). It is perfectly feasible to type 

 12.345+0.1/1.67-4

into the dialog, press '''&lt;enter&gt;''' and receive a legitimate result for a particular operation.


Note that Wings recognizes a number of mathematical expressions. In the dialog box, type '''math:''' before the expression -- for example, '''math:pi''' would call up the value of pi. Here are the allowed expressions:

* sin
* cos
* tan
* asin
* acos
* atan
* atan
* sinh
* cosh
* tanh
* asinh
* acosh
* atanh
* exp
* log
* log10
* pow
* sqrt
* abs
* pi

==== Dialog Box History ====
Another feature of the dialog boxes is a kind of &quot;history&quot; feature. The tab entry dialog box retains previous entries and can pull those values back up at your bidding. Pressing the up and down arrow keys will scroll through the history of past inputs. Access to previous entries in a dialog box can be a useful, especially when you have to perform the same procedure more than once in a session. The history function allows you to quickly repeat a procedure at a constant value. Keep in mind that dialog box input history is not exclusive to each tool. It keeps a running history of the inputs for ''all tools''. This means that the last entry you typed will appear when you press the up arrow once, '''not necessarily the input you typed for the last time you used that particular tool.'''

=== Assigning Hotkeys ===
Wings has a set of standard hotkeys which come predefined upon installing. (For your current hotkey listing, in the Menu Bar go to '''Help|Defined Hotkeys'''.) One of the great advantages that Wings offers its users is the ability to set user-defined hotkeys. 

Any command that appears in a menu can be assigned to a keyboard shortcut. To assign a hotkey to a command, open the menu containing the command. Highlight the command and press the '''&lt;Insert&gt;''' or the '''&lt;/&gt;''' key, followed by the key you wish to assign it to. The hotkey should now appear beside the command. To delete a hotkey, highlight the command and press the '''&lt; Del &gt;''' or '''&lt;\&gt;''' key.

==== What To Know About Hotkeys ====
Here are a few facts about hotkeying in Wings which will help in creating a layout that works for you.

* The hotkey assigned to a tool or command is displayed beside it in the menu where that command is found.
* Wings accepts any combination of '''&lt;Ctrl&gt;''', '''&lt;Shift&gt;''' or '''&lt;Alt&gt;''' as a modifier to a hotkey. For instance, using the '''B''' key, you can assign the following eight commands:
** ''B, &lt;Ctrl&gt;+B, &lt;Shift&gt;+B, &lt;Alt&gt;+B, &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt;+B, &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+B, &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+B, &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+B''
* Wings uses context-sensitive hotkeys. Just as with context-sensitive menus, Wings only allows you access to hotkeys of tools and commands available from within the current selection mode. This means that you can re-use the same hotkey for tools or commands in different Modes. For instance '''S''' can be assigned to both '''Smooth''' in the Face menu and '''Slide''' in the Edge menu. If there is a conflict, Wings will tell you right away.
* Hotkeys assigned to tools or commands found in the Menu Bar cannot be re-used. This is because the commands found in Menu Bar menus will (for the most part) work across all modes, essentially making them global hotkeys. For example, if you assign '''&lt;Ctrl&gt;+T''' to '''Tweak''' in the Tools Menu, you cannot re-use this hotkey because pressing '''&lt;Ctrl&gt;+T''' in any mode will start up '''Tweak Mode'''.
* Wings does not currently allow hotkeying for right or middle mouse button options.

Currently there is no built in facility for printing out a list of your hotkeys, however, you can use the Erlang Console to produce an HTML document of all your hotkeys, which can be printed. To do this, you must enter some code into the Erlang Console; instructions can be found on [http://chronosphere.home.comcast.net/tut-wings-shell.htm Scorpius's web page].

==== Hotkey Strategies ====


Although everybody eventually comes up with their own system for hotkeys, there are some good basic strategies to get you started. The primary tools in Wings -- such as Move, Rotate, and Scale -- have five basic directions along which you can perform an operation. These are:

* the three axes '''X''', '''Y''', '''Z'''
* along the selection's '''Normal'''
* along the plane created by the camera's point of view, called '''Free'''

The primary tools Move, Rotate, and Scale also share the fact that they are available across all of the selection modes. Because of this it makes sense to use the same hotkey for Move -- say, 'M' -- in all four selection modes and use modifier keys to achieve the five basic directions. Because the basic directions X, Y, Z, Normal, and Free exist across all modes for a variety of tools, it makes sense to assign a modifier key to each direction.

For example, if we decide that '''&lt;Alt&gt;''' represents the X direction, then &quot;Move along X axis&quot; would be &lt;Alt&gt;+M. You can then hotkey &quot;Move along X axis&quot; as &lt;Alt&gt;+M in the Vertex, Edge, Face, Body, and Light selection modes, so no matter what selection mode you are in, you can always hit &lt;Alt&gt;+M to move your selection along the X axis. You could then consider using &lt;Ctrl&gt; for the Z axis, and &lt;Shift&gt; for the Y axis so that no matter what tool you use, the modifier for the operation's direction is always the same.

Say you decide that 'R' is for rotate. &quot;Rotate around the Z axis&quot; can be hotkeyed as &lt;Shift&gt;+R, and &quot;rotate around the X axis&quot; can be &lt;Alt&gt;+R, just like &quot;move along Z axis&quot; could be &lt;Shift&gt;+M. Once you decide what is best for you you can assign the other directions. Remember that there are eight possible combinations of any key plus its modifiers. This should be plenty to get the majority of the tools hotkeyed in a way you are going to remember them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wings3D is written in the [[w:Erlang_programming_language|Erlang programming language]]. The Erlang binaries needed for Wings are compiled into the Wings distribution.

A list of currently-available plugins can be found [[Wings 3D/User Manual/Plugins|here]]. Note that plugins don’t necessarily work with every version of Wings3D; a given plugin might only work with a particular update.

If you're interested in developing for Wings, you'll need to download the full Erlang distribution. You can download both the Wings3D binaries and Erlang source and runtime libraries for Windows from the [http://www.wings3d.com/ Wings home page].

==Windows==

OpenGL and Windows 2000 or higher are required in order to run Wings 0.99.

The Wings download is a self extracting installer; to install Wings, simply double click on the installer. When a new version of Wings becomes available, simply download the new installer for Wings and overwrite the old installation.

==Linux==

Open GL or Mesa is required in order to run Wings 0.99.

Decompress the installation file from the archive wings-0.XXX-linux.run.gz:
    $ gzip -d wings-0.XXX-linux.run.gz

And install it:
    $ ./wings-0.XXX-linux.run

A directory with the name wings-0.XXX will be created in your home directory. In order to run Wings3d:
    $~/wings-0.XXX/wings

==Mac==

* Mac OS X 10.4 (&quot;Tiger&quot;) is required in order to run Wings 0.98.35.
* Mac OS X 10.3 (&quot;Panther&quot;) is required in order to run Wings 0.98.26.
* Mac OS X 10.2 is required in order to run versions of Wings earlier than 0.99.

Download and open the .dmg (disk image) file and copy the enclosed file to your desired directory. It is ready to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Right now, it is only my intention to cover the most standard variation of Euchre, as played on Yahoo with the Stick the Dealer option.  If other people want to add sections covering the strategies for alternative rulesets, that's fine.  I would appreciate it, however, if you have the calculations of probability to back up your strategies, at least where reasonable.

In the past, {{tl|wikiquote}} at Wikibooks module A linked to Wikiquote article A. All three calls to {{tl|wikiquote}} at Wikibooks made broken links.

I changed the template so that {{tl|wikiquote}} searches for A at Wikiquote. There is also an optional parameter to link to a page instead of search. This is what {{tl|wikipedia}} and {{tl|wikisource}} already do. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:06, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

&lt;br&gt;
Please note that screen shots may vary as to
exact layout based on different versions of
Wings at the time of their capture.

Also note that the Mirai camera mode is
assumed throughout the text unless noted
otherwise. Keep this in mind while reading,
especially if you use one of the other camera
modes.

[[Image:Wings3d_UM_Overview1.png|thumb|The Wings3D program window|400px|right]]

Wings3D opens with an empty [[Wings_3D/User_Manual/User_Interface/The_Geometry_Window|Geometry Window]] at its core. Above the Geometry Window are the [[Wings_3D/User_Manual/User_Interface/The_Title_Bar|Title Bar]], the [[Wings_3D/User_Manual/User_Interface/The_Menu_Bar|Menu Bar]], the [[Wings_3D/User_Manual/User_Interface/The_Toolbar|Tool Bar]], and the [[Wings_3D/User_Manual/User_Interface/The_Status_Bar|Status Bar]].  At the bottom of the window is the [[Wings_3D/User_Manual/User_Interface/The_Information_Line|Information Line]]. The rest of the user interface is accessed via [[Wings_3D/User_Manual/User_Interface/Context_Sensitive_Menus|context sensitive menus]] called up via clicking the Right Mouse Button over the Workspace. 

In the Workspace itself are the three main axes which are conveniently labeled X, Y, and Z. It is customary to think in terms of X as being the right and left, Y the up and down and Z the front and back of a model. Many of the commands are axis centric in operation, working around these global axes or around local axes parallel to them. Display colors for each axis can be set to your liking and they can be toggled on or off at will.

You will also find a grid which is useful for measuring the objects you create. It uses Wings Units which is an arbitrary size that you can use to represent any scale you want. i.e. inches, feet etc… On the lower right hand side of the screen you will find a small tab. This is used to resize the geometry window. This is also useful for adding more geometry windows or making room for the [[Wings_3D/User_Manual/Outliner|Outliner]] and [[Wings_3D/User_Manual/Geometry_Graph|Geometry Graph]] so they don’t cover the workspace. The info bar on the bottom shows what options are available, in this case what each mouse button will do, and it will also act as a tool tip informing you of each item's function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==

*The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values of a variable.  In some contexts, it is a single value obtained by subtracting the lowest (minimum) from the highest (maximum) value. In other contexts, the minimum and maximum are both persented and the range is a pair of values. For example, if the data include values from 10 through 42, the range may be expressed as either 32 (42-10) or the pair (10,42). 



== Usages ==

*The range is a marker of the spread or variability of a variable.

* The range is often a very unstable marker of variability because it can be highly influenced by a single outlier value.  For instance, if the data contain the ages of many high school students all with values between 13 and 19 except for a single (perhaps erroneous) value of 93, the range is 80 rather than a more representative value of about 6.

== Distributions ==

*The range is calcuable for any distribution measured on at least an ordinal scale.

== Software ==

The range is usually presented along with other common descriptors by most commercial statistical software.
*Stata: summarize ''varname''
*Excel: If the data are entered into cells B5 through B50, the range will be returned by the formula: &lt;math&gt;=maximum(B5:B50)-minimum(B5:B50))&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Stuttering is a difficult and demoralizing disability, but with persistence many stutterers overcome the disorder and go on to successful lives.&lt;/p&gt; 

==Singers and Actors==

&lt;p&gt;Some stutterers are afraid to open their mouths. But other stutterers earn their living with their voices.&lt;/p&gt;

===Carly Simon, Singer-Songwriter===

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Carly_Simon|Carly Simon]] (1945- ) began stuttering severely when she was eight years old. She blames her stuttering on her then 44-year-old mother's affair with their 20-year-old live-in tennis instructor. The affair caused jealousy, anger, &amp;quot;lies and a train of deception&amp;quot; in the Simon's affluent household.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A psychiatrist tried unsuccessfully to cure Simon's stuttering. Instead, Simon turned to singing and songwriting. &amp;quot;I felt so strangulated talking that I did the natural thing, which is to write songs, because I could sing without stammering, as all stammerers can.&amp;quot;{{ref|Brenner1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simon wrote some of the most-loved songs of the 1970s, including &amp;quot;Anticipation&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;You're So Vain.&amp;quot; She won an Oscar and a Grammy. She was married to [[w:James_Taylor|James Taylor]] for nine years. They have two children.&lt;/p&gt;

===Mel Tillis, Country Music Entertainer===

&lt;p&gt;As a child, [[w:Mel_Tillis|Mel Tillis]] (1932- ), was laughed at because he stuttered.{{ref|Nefsky1997}} He said to himself, &amp;quot;Well, if they're gonna laugh at me, then I'll give them something to laugh about.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1957 he began working as a singer for [[w:Minnie_Pearl|Minnie Pearl]], Nashville's great country comedienne. Pearl encouraged Tillis to talk on stage, but he refused, afraid that he'd be laughed at. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pearl replied, &amp;quot;Let 'em laugh. Goodness gracious, laughs are hard to get and I'm sure that they're laughing with you and not against you, Melvin.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little by little, Tillis increased his speaking on-stage. He developed humorous routines about his stuttering. Then &amp;quot;word began to circulate around [[w:Nashville|Nashville]] about this young singer from Florida who could write songs and sing, but stuttered like hell when he tried to talk. The next thing I knew I was being asked to be on every major television show in America.&amp;quot; Tillis' career took off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before Nashville and fame and fortune, Tillis was looking for a job in Florida. No one hired him. At the last place he applied, the owner said that he had once stuttered. He wouldn't hire Tillis, but gave him a piece of paper to read every night, saying that it had changed his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the paper was a prayer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh Lord, Grant me the Courage to change the things I can change, the Serenity to accept those I cannot change, and the Wisdom to know the difference. And God, Grant me the Courage to not give up on what I think is right, even though I think it is hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tillis concludes his story,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a long time, I slept well that night. I woke the next morning with a different outlook on life. I told myself that if I couldn't quit stuttering, then the world was going to have to take me like I was. What you see is what you get. From that day on, things started looking up for Mel Tillis. Soon after, I headed for [[w:Nashville|Nashville]] in a '49 Mercury with a wife and a four-month-old baby girl&amp;#151;her name was [[w:Pam_Tillis|Pam]].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1976, Tillis was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;

===More Singers and Musicians===

&lt;p&gt;Other stutterers with successful singing careers include Metropolitan Opera singer [[w:Robert_Merrill|Robert Merrill]] (1917-2004), jazz vocalist [[w:Scatman_John|&amp;quot;Scatman&amp;quot; John Larkin]] (1942-1999) and pop singer [[w: Gareth_Gates|Gareth Gates]].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1965, [[w:Roger_Daltry|Roger Daltry]] (1944- ) of [[w:The_Who|The Who]] used stuttering in the song &amp;quot;My Generation&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;The stutter was introduced because the 'My Generation' character was supposed to be a [[w:Mod_%28lifestyle%29|mod]] blocked on pills &amp;#151;and [[w:Amphetamine|amphetamine]] abusers stammered like mad.&amp;quot;{{ref|Marsh1983}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in 1965, stutterer Ian Whitcomb recorded the hit &amp;quot;You Turn Me On.&amp;quot; According to radio host [[w:Dr._Demento|Dr. Demento]], &amp;quot;Whitcomb stutters quite a bit in conversation, but very rarely when he's on mike.&amp;quot; Whitcomb had a popular public radio show in Los Angeles for many years.{{ref|Hansen1999}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1975, stutterer Gary Bachman was managing his brother Randy's band, [[w:Bachman_Turner_Overdrive|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]. The song &amp;quot;You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet&amp;quot; was written as an inside joke, about Gary's stuttering. The band didn't intend it to be heard by anyone else. But a record label executive heard the song and insisted on releasing it. The song went to #1 on the [[w:Adult_Contemporary_%28Billboard_Chart%29|Billboard charts]].{{ref|Morthland1993}}&lt;/p&gt;

===James Earl Jones, Actor===

&lt;p&gt;[[w:James_Earl_Jones|James Earl Jones]] (1931- ), the most in-demand voice in [[w:Hollywood|Hollywood]], is a stutterer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jones was &amp;quot;virtually mute&amp;quot; as a child.{{ref|Jones1993}} With the help of his high school English teacher, Jones overcame stuttering by reading Shakespeare &amp;quot;aloud in the fields to myself,&amp;quot; and then reading to audiences, and then acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jones is proudest of his role as [[w:Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] &lt;i&gt;[[w:Othello|Othello]]&lt;/i&gt;, but is best-known as the voice of Darth Vader in &lt;i&gt;[[w:Star_Wars|Star Wars]]&lt;/i&gt;. He portrayed a stutterer in the movie &lt;i&gt;A Family Thing&lt;/i&gt; (1995).&lt;/p&gt;

===More Actors===

&lt;p&gt;Other stutterers who found fluency in acting include [[w:Bruce_Willis|Bruce Willis]] (1955- ), who said of his childhood, &amp;quot;I had a horrible stutter&amp;#133;I couldn't talk&amp;quot;{{ref|Willis1999}}; [[w:Peggy_Lipton|Peggy Lipton]] (1947- ), who starred in the television series &lt;i&gt;[[w:The_Mod_Squad|The Mod Squad]]&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;[[w:Twin_Peaks|Twin Peaks]]&lt;/i&gt;{{ref|Hutchings1988}}; and [[w:Nicholas_Brendon|Nicholas Brendon]] (1971- ), who played Xander on &lt;i&gt;[[w:Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]&lt;/i&gt;.{{ref|SFA2002}} &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sculptor and theater director [[w:Robert_Wilson_%28director%29|Robert Wilson]] (1941- ) overcame stuttering at 17 with the help of his dance teacher.{{ref|Hutchings1988}} [[w:Marilyn_Monroe|Marilyn Monroe]] (1926-1962) used a breathy way of speaking to avoid stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Peter_Bonerz|Peter Bonerz]] (1938- ), who played Jerry the dentist on &lt;i&gt;The Bob Newhart Show&lt;/i&gt;, and directed &lt;i&gt;Friends&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Murphy Brown&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Home Improvement&lt;/i&gt;, said about his stuttering:{{ref|Drew1997}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm 58 years old, and if I stutter while giving [[w:Candice_Bergen|Candice Bergen]] a direction, who cares? If (the stuttering) is really difficult, I exaggerate it and get everyone on the set to laugh with me. A stutter can really be quite charming. We are human and not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Gracie_Allen|Gracie Allen]] &amp;quot;was looking for [vaudeville performer] [[w:Billy Lorraine|Billy Lorraine]] who was a terrible stammerer. He was shy about his stammering. Gracie approached him and asked him if he was Billy Lorraine. Billy said he wasn't and pointed at [[w:George_Burns|George Burns]]. George Burns pretended he was Billy Lorraine for a while.&amp;quot;{{ref|Gottfried}} Thus the most famous couple of comedy met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her autobiography, [[w:Marion_Davies|Marion Davies]] (1897-1961) wrote, &amp;quot;Mother decided that I was kind of a problem. Because I stuttered, no school wanted me. When I'd get up to recite, all the kids would laugh at me. So my mother decided to put me in a convent.&amp;quot;{{ref|NY1998}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, &amp;quot;Fifty-two-year-old publishing magnate [[w:William_Randolph_Hearst|William Randolph Hearst]] was smitten the first time he saw eighteen-year-old Marion Davies in a chorus line. A year later, when she was given one speaking line in Ziegfeld's Follies, she botched it. Hearst, determined to make her a star, provided coaches to work day and night on her stammer. She improved, and starred in a number of films.&amp;quot;{{ref|Wallichenski1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Hearst and Davies became the basis of [[w:Orson_Welles|Orson Welles]]' classic movie, &lt;i&gt;[[w:Citizen_Kane|Citizen Kane]]&lt;/i&gt;. But Welles changed Davies' stuttering into an inability to sing opera!&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Interquartile Range (IQR) is the range from the 25th to the 75th percentile of a distribution.  It represents the &quot;Middle Half&quot; of the data and is a marker of variability or spread that is robust to outliers. 

*'''Wikipedia article:''' [[Wikipedia:Interquartile range|Interquartile Range]]

The IQR is a component of the [[Wikipedia:Box plot|Box plot]], a useful graphical representation of distributions.

&lt;p&gt;Some stutterers compensate for their speech difficulties by excelling at non-verbal activities, such as sports. But you'll see that top athletes must do more than score points in a game.&lt;/p&gt;

==Bob Love, Basketball Player==

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Bob_Love|Bob Love]] (1942- ) was a three-time NCAA All-Star and led the [[w:Chicago_Bulls|Chicago Bulls]] in scoring for seven consecutive seasons. Reporters rarely interviewed him. &amp;quot;I would score 45 points, go into the locker room, and all the reporters would come down,&amp;quot; Love recalls. &amp;quot;Everybody would pass me by.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love retired in 1977. Because of his stuttering he went from one dead-end job to another. The low point was in 1985, at the age of 42, when a restaurant hired Love as a $4.45/hour busboy. Love had tried speech therapy twice before without success. He tried again. After a year of stuttering therapy, Love began public speaking. As a boy, he had a dream of standing on a podium, speaking to thousands of people. Love gave motivational speeches to churches, high school students, and other groups. He's now director of community relations and spokesman for the Bulls. &amp;quot;It's hard to believe I make a living speaking. It's a dream come true. I held onto my dreams, and I tell kids they have to hold on to theirs.&amp;quot;{{ref|Lawrence1993}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Bill Walton, Basketball Player==

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Bill_Walton|Bill Walton]] (1952- ) led UCLA to two NCAA titles, and the [[w:Portland_Trailblazers|Portland Trailblazers]] and [[w:Boston_Celtics|Boston Celtics]] to NBA championships. His stuttering was so severe that he couldn't say simple phrases like &amp;quot;thank you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Walton has overcome his stuttering and works as a sports commentator for NBC Sports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Walton was battling stuttering through childhood, college, and his professional career, he used basketball as a sanctuary, a place where he didn't have to think about his speech. The challenges in his personal life pushed him to become one of the best players on the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, on the court, he could not only play ball, he could speak, too. Or at least yell. &amp;quot;I never had any trouble yelling at the refs,&amp;quot; Walton said. &amp;quot;In the heat of the game&amp;#133;when it was just totally spontaneous, I could get out there and really scream and yell at the refs. But it was only in basketball, and it was only at the refs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When each game ended, Walton stuttered again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;During college, the teasing was tough,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I had a speech class one year, and they laughed me out of the class.&amp;quot; It didn't matter to his classmates that he was the college basketball Player of the Year. &amp;quot;I was trying to make it in school, and they just laughed me out of the class.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At awards ceremonies and media events, Walton shied away from microphones. He even had other people speak on his behalf. &amp;quot;When I had to actually formulate words and make a statement, I could not do it at all,&amp;quot; he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the NBA, he faced some of the toughest and most legendary players in the history of the game. Playing basketball with [[w:Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and [[w:Larry_Bird|Larry Bird]] (no relation to stutterer Larry Burd) came naturally. Speaking, still, did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he retired from basketball, the sanctuary was gone. The hiding place that had protected him for 28 years could shelter him no longer. But his love for the game helped him with stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Walton, long-time friend and Hall of Fame broadcaster [[w:Marty_Glickman|Marty Glickman]] pulled him aside at a social event and said, &amp;quot;You've got to learn how to talk.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He gave me some very basic tips, and I applied those tips to the learning techniques I learned from my coach at UCLA [[w:John_Wooden|John Wooden]] about how to develop as a basketball player,&amp;quot; Walton explained. &amp;quot;I thought about fundamentals and how to start with the basics like the ability to mechanically duplicate moves on the basketball court. And I just applied that to speaking.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Walton learned to speak, just as he had learned basketball years before. Not only did he stop stuttering, he found a way back&amp;#151;through sports commentating&amp;#151;to the game he loved so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he began broadcasting for NBC Sports, all of his fears resurfaced. Off the court, he was still afraid to talk. He describes his first broadcast as &amp;quot;painful&amp;quot; but knows now that the worst is over. &amp;quot;I used to be really embarrassed about stuttering. But now I realize that it's something that is a part of me&amp;#133;something that I have to deal with and work on every day. If I don't work on it, I'm not going to be able to do my job. It's always a challenge,&amp;quot; Walton said. He doesn't mind the challenge&amp;#151;that's what makes him strive to do his best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walton challenges others to get on top of stuttering too. &amp;quot;It's important to know that help is out there. The ability to learn how to talk is easily the greatest thing I've ever done. Winning two NCAA championships and two NBA titles was nice, but I knew it was going to happen. But learning how to speak has given me a whole new life. I have been set free.&amp;quot;{{ref|SFA1996}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Other Athletes==

&lt;p&gt;Other athletes who stutter include Olympic diver and gay advocate [[w:Greg_Louganis|Greg Louganis]] (1960- ).{{ref|Louganis1995}}; golfer [[w:Ken_Venturi|Ken Venturi]] (1931- ), who won 1961 U.S. Open, and is now a commentator for CBS Sports.{{ref|Venturi1994}}; and Swedish Golfer [[w:Sophie_Gustafson|Sophie Gustafson]] (1973- ), who doesn't stutter when singing karaoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian sprinter [[w:Ben_Johnson_%28athlete%29|Ben Johnson]] (1961- ) ran the fastest 100-meters ever, but then tested positive for steroids. &amp;quot;He speaks with a heavy Jamaican accent made at times incomprehensible by a stutter.&amp;quot;{{ref|Kram1998}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Jake Steinfeld|Jake Steinfeld]], bodybuilder and television fitness trainer.{{ref|NYDN1997}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseball pitcher [[w:Tommy_John|Tommy John]] (1943- ) was a four-time All-Star, and was the winning pitcher in two World Series games.{{ref|Gathman1998}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When [[w:Ty_Cobb|Ty Cobb]] (1886-1961) retired from baseball in 1928 he was the holder of ninety major league records and he received the most votes of the first five players elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, in 1936.{{ref|Stump}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseball and football pro [[w:Bo_Jackson|Bo Jackson]] (1962- ) wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My teachers thought I couldn't read. I could read, but I'd never read aloud because I stuttered. The other kids would laugh at me, and I became a recluse. I was angry at myself and at them, and it often resulted in my beating someone up after school. I had to live with it for eight or nine years, but I finally decided to pay it no attention and forced myself to do everything from reading in class to making speeches. Eventually, I learned to relax and take my time.{{ref|PBS1993}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Howard Bingham|Howard Bingham]], friend of [[w:Muhammed_Ali|Muhammed Ali]] and [[w:O.J._Simpson|O.J. Simpson]], stuttered as a witness in Simpson's trial. Growing up, Bingham &amp;quot;endured the usual teasing from schoolmates because of his stuttering. In high school&amp;#133;he hid behind his stuttering and didn't volunteer for anything.&amp;quot; His friendship with Muhammed Ali began in 1962, continued through photographing the Black Panther Party and &amp;quot;virtually every significant urban uprising&amp;quot; in the 1960s. Bingham later worked as [[w:Bill_Cosby|Bill Cosby's]] photographer. He wrote the book &lt;i&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0671760785&amp;tag=softlogic&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325| Muhammad Ali: A Thirty Year Journey]&lt;/i&gt;, and worked for years to get his friend the honor of lighting the Olympic flame that started the 1996 Atlanta Games. Ironically, Bingham now sometimes has to talk for Ali, due to Ali having Parkinson's disease.{{ref|Zimmerman1998}}&lt;/p&gt;

The  {{C sharp|internal}} keyword is an ''access modifier'' used in field, [[C Sharp Programming/Classes#Methods|method]], and [[C Sharp Programming/Classes#Properties|property]] declarations to make the field, method, or property ''internal'' to its enclosing assembly. That is, it is only [[w:Variable (computer science)#Scope and extent|visible]] within the assembly that implements it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The biochemical mechanism of peptide bond formation is below. For a more chemical description, please consult the [[Organic Chemistry]] textbook. 

''Note: As with any biochemical mechanism, the following is enzyme-catalyzed and does not occur spontaneously in the cell. Enzyme active sites are left out for clarity.''

==Biochemical Mechanism==
The addition of a the amino-terminus of an amino acid to the carboxy-terminus of a second amino acid goes through two primary steps:
#Carboxylate Activation
#Nucleophilic Addition/Formation of the tetrahedral intermediate
#Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate

===Carboxylate Activation===
The carbonyl lone pair of the carboxy-terminal carbonyl attacks the terminal phosphate on a molecule of ATP via an SN2 reaction. The ADP acts as a leaving group, and the hydroxyl group on the carboxylate donates into the forming carbocation. Finally, the new carbonyl on the now phosphate ester is deprotonated.

===Nucleophilic Addition===
The lone pair of the amino-terminus on the second amino acid attacks the carbonyl carbon of the phosphate ester, forming a tetrahedral intermediate with four substituents on the former carbonyl carbon: the oxylate ion, the phosphate, the nucleophile, and the alpha carbon of the first amino acid.
Finally, the amine nucleophile is deprotonated to a neutral state.

===Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate===
A lone pair on the oxylate ion collapses on the phosphate carbon, and the inorganic phosphate is lost as a leaving group. The resulting bond is an amide bond between the carbonyl carbon and the amine group.

From the article: &quot; whilst many pronouns can be modified to indicate case (who versus whose) or gender (he versus she, his versus hers)&quot; -- Shouldn't this be &quot;who versus whom&quot;? Also, &quot;whilst&quot; is a little archaic for non-native speakers.

:The example is correct, who, he and she are nominative case, and whose, and hers are genitive case.[[User:Gaius Calvus|Gaius Calvus]] 12:47, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

:I don't know if &quot;whilst&quot; is considerd archaic, where I come from (Worcestershire) it is still commonplace.[[User:Gaius Calvus|Gaius Calvus]] 12:47, 22 February 2006 (UTC)

::It's commonplace in the UK, but considered archaic in the US. I don't know what its usage is like in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, India, etc ... --[[User:Bazzalisk|Bazzalisk]] ([[User talk:Bazzalisk|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bazzalisk|contribs]]) 16:49, 28 March 2011 (UTC)


Forgive me if I'm not doing this correctly, but should there be a mention of the different pronunciations?  As in c pronounced softly and so on?


Warning: This grammar introduction (particularly the part at the end about adjectives taking such-and-such declension) is extremely confusing for a novice.  Are adjectives just repurposed nouns?  Do adjectives have separate declensions?  Also, referring to 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc. declension endings is extremely confusing for new folk when it's done without reference to an example.  It would be clearer to say &quot;First declension adjectives modifying masculine nouns take first declension endings (-a, -am....)&quot; instead.  This is of particular concern given that the introduction is perforce dedicated to new learners.
I would make these changes myself, but I feel I should probably learn Latin first before making substantive edits :)


Pronunciation of 'all' Latin letters would be appreciated, even the ones that are supposed to be similar to English. That doesn't tell me a lot.

==Pronunciation==

Which version of the Classical pronunciation is followed here?  I currently know of FOUR different ideas of what the Classical pronunciation is supposed to sound like.  Each one is supported by different groups of universities but they are far from unified.  The only thing they agree on is that you should not use the Catholic Pronunciation but I do not see the reasoning behind this.  The Catholic pronunciation makes perfect sense to me, I can do that without having to stop and repronounce every word.  When the Pope gives a speach he uses the Catholic pronunciation and he is the only one I know of who is giving speaches in Latin these days.  If I want to understand what the Pope is saying then I need to know the Catholic pronunciation right?  Please do not tell me that the real reason the Classical pronunciation exist is because of Anti-Catholicism.  If we really know how the Ancients spoke Latin then how come there are FOUR different rule sets, each claiming to be the 100% correct form?

==Diphthongs?==

I was taught that ae, oe and au were the only diphthongs, yet it says 'The dipthong &quot;ae&quot; is pronounced as the &quot;ai&quot; in &quot;aisle&quot;. The dipthong &quot;au&quot; is pronounced &quot;ow&quot;. The dipthong &quot;oe&quot; is pronounced &quot;oy&quot; in &quot;boy&quot;. The dipthong &quot;eu&quot; is pronounced as &quot;eh-oo&quot; The dipthong &quot;ou&quot; is pronounced &quot;oo&quot;. The dipthong &quot;ui&quot; is pronounced &quot;we&quot;.'. I'm definetly sure that ui is not a diphthong, or &quot;fuit&quot; would be a monosyllable, and ou seems suspicious too... Are there any objections to the removal of those?

== Letter C ==

In the text say that the letter C is always hard. I don´t think so, ´Cause when we say for example Regina Caeli: is &quot;Sh-ai-l-y&quot; and not : K-ai-l-y. Excuse me for I Speak spanish. Pax et Bonum!--[[User:R Católico|R Católico]] ([[User talk:R Católico|talk]]) 14:42, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

== Odd Example ==

In what pronunciation is the English word &quot;odd&quot; pronounced part way between &quot;ah&quot; and &quot;uh&quot;? It's pronounced with the most definite 'o' I can think of in RP.

--[[User:Bazzalisk|Bazzalisk]] ([[User talk:Bazzalisk|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bazzalisk|contribs]]) 16:47, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

== The Letter Q ==

In your letter pronunciation guide, there's no mention of the proper pronunciation of the letter 'Q'.  Seems important since it's not always a universal pronunciation.  Knowing Spanish makes me assume it's like a hard C, but I imagine it may be more like the English |ku|.

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Annie_Glenn|Annie Glenn]]  (1920- ), wife of astronaut and Senator [[w:John_Glenn|John Glenn]], once refused to talk to President [[w:Lyndon_Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] because of her stuttering.{{ref|Wolfe}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representative [[w:Dennis_Kucinich|Dennis Kucinich]] (1946- ; D-Ohio) overcame stuttering as a child. Rep. Kucinich was elected mayor of Cleveland at the age of 31. As a state senator, he won the 1996 National Association for Social Workers Outstanding Senator of the Year Award. He also won an Emmy for his political analysis on WJW-TV.{{ref|ASHA}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Business Leaders==

&lt;p&gt;In the business world, [[w:John_Sculley|John Sculley's]] (1939- ) stuttering &amp;quot;has taken him many years to overcome. He was also painfully shy.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sculley wrote in his autobiography, &amp;quot;I was determined to build a strength out of what was originally a weakness. I went to the theater to watch how performers positioned themselves on stage. I'd practice for hours. I became obsessed with the idea that I was going to become better than anyone else as a business communicator.&amp;quot;{{ref|Sculley1987}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sculley rose to president of Pepsi-Cola. He succeeded in overtaking Coca-Cola as the #1 soft drink. He then changed coasts and cultures to become president of Apple Computer for ten years. Sculley became a great public speaker, gaining &amp;quot;renown for his ability to deliver rousing speeches in front of thousands, sometimes without notes.&amp;quot;{{ref|Carlton1997}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stutterer and CEO [[w:Jack_Welch|Jack Welch]] (1935- ) led General Electric to become one of the largest and most profitable American corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

==Doctors==

&lt;p&gt;Nino Salvatore was president of the Medical University of Naples. &amp;quot;He is a very successful professor of General Pathology.

&lt;p&gt;The man who brought us LSD was &amp;quot;a lifelong stutterer.&amp;quot; [[w:Sidney_Gottlieb|Sidney Gottlieb]] (1918-1999), described by friends as &amp;quot;a kind of genius,&amp;quot; had a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Caltech. He joined the CIA in 1951. In 1953 he founded the MKUltra program, which gave LSD to thousands of CIA agents, military officers, college students, prisoners, and mental patients. Many of the study participants were unknowingly dosed with the drug. Gottlieb took LSD hundreds of times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gottlieb's later work at the CIA included developing &amp;quot;a poison handkerchief to kill an Iraqi colonel, an array of toxic gifts to be delivered to Fidel Castro, and a poison dart to kill a leftist leader in the Congo. None of the plans succeeded.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
&lt;p&gt;Several British royals stuttered. [[w:Charles_I_of_England|Charles I]] (1600-1649) was king from 1625 until 1649, during the English Civil War. His inability to speak to Parliament &amp;quot;had an unfavorable influence on his affairs.&amp;quot; Charles lost the war and was executed. It didn't help that he proclaimed that he was above the law: &amp;quot;a king and a subject are two plain different things.&amp;quot; His father, [[w:James_I_of_England|James I]] (1566-1625), was described as &amp;quot;having a tongue too big for his mouth&amp;quot;&amp;#151;possibly an articulation disorder.{{ref|Fraser1974}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:George_VI|George VI]] (1895-1952) was king from 1937 until 1952. He was father of Queen [[w:Elizabeth_II|Elizabeth II]]. His annual live Christmas broadcasts were &amp;quot;always an ordeal.&amp;quot;{{ref|Bobrick1995}} Robert Graves' 1934 novel [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/067972477X&amp;tag=softlogic&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325| I, Claudius] is ostensibly about the Roman emperor Claudius, who stuttered. But the personality and life of Graves' Claudius were taken from the shy George VI. George survived the scandals of his brother Edward's abdication, was thrust into a role to which he was thought unsuited, and surprised everyone by becoming one of the most capable and loved modern kings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, Bruce Oldfield outgrew childhood stuttering and designed gowns for [[w:Princess_Diana|Princess Diana]].{{ref|Johnson1987}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Winston Churchill and Aneurin Bevan, Statesmen==

&lt;p&gt;Sixty years ago the best orators of the British Parliament were both stutterers. [[w:Aneurin_Bevan|Aneurin Bevan]] (1897-1960), leader of the Labour Party and architect of the National Health Service, forced himself to make speeches as often as possible. He spoke fluently when his passions were aroused, so he spoke passionately for British workers in the 1930s. Bevan developed an extraordinary vocabulary by substituting words to avoid stuttering.{{ref|Bobrick1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Winston_Churchill|Winston Churchill]] (1874-1965), leader of the Conservative Party, could speak fluently only by preparing his remarks in advance. He studied issues weeks in advance, and wrote out responses to any possible objection. This extra effort made Churchill more knowledgeable than other leaders.{{ref|Bobrick1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a young man, Churchill worried that his stuttering would impact his ambition to go into politics. But he didn't believe in submitting to failure so he practiced and persevered. He both practiced his speeches and practiced nonsense phrases as he walked, such as &amp;quot;The Spanish ships I cannot see since they are not in sight.&amp;quot; When he was 23, he wrote, &amp;quot;Sometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience&amp;#133;&amp;quot;{{ref|Montalbo}}&lt;/p&gt;

==More British Stutterers==

&lt;p&gt;The British are fond of eccentrics and stutterers.{{ref|Bobrick1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Robert_Boyle|Robert Boyle]] (1627-92) was a chemist known for his experiments on the properties of gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Isaac_Newton|Isaac Newton]] (1643-1727) was a physicist, mathematician, and astronomer.&lt;/p&gt;

==David Carpenter==

&lt;p&gt;After examining a series of killings near San Francisco area hiking trails in 1979, FBI psychological profiler John Douglas concluded that the Trailside Killer was a stutterer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most serial killers approach their victims in a social situation and talk the victims into getting in a car, such as picking up hitchhikers. But the Trailside Killer attacked women hiking alone. The Trailside Killer used a &amp;quot;blitz&amp;quot; attack to overpower and dominate his victims, suggesting that he was &amp;quot;someone with some condition he felt awkward or ashamed about&amp;quot; who overpowered and controlled women as &amp;quot;his way of overcoming this handicap.&amp;quot; But the power of the attack ruled out a physically disabled killer. A &amp;quot;very homely&amp;quot; or disfigured individual would have been remembered by witnesses. Douglas concluded that stuttering can make a strong man feel powerless, and was something the killer &amp;quot;could easily feel ashamed of or uncomfortable with&amp;#133;yet wouldn't 'stand out' in a crowd. No one would know about it until he opened his mouth, took off his hat, and picked his afro. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One victim was a high school student working part-time at a bank. She had been &amp;quot;kind and sweet&amp;#133;to a regular customer with a severe stutter&amp;quot;&amp;#151;who had an incarceration record for sex crimes. 50-year-old industrial arts teacher David Carpenter was investigated and convicted of murdering eight women.&lt;/p&gt;

==Robert Hansen==
&lt;p&gt;In 1983, a seventeen-year-old prostitute in Anchorage, Alaska told a fantastic story to police. A man had handcuffed her, taken her home, and raped and brutalized her. Then he took her to his private airplane, telling her they were going to his remote cabin. She escaped and ran to the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Hansen was in his mid-forties, married with two children, and manager of a successful bakery. He owned an expensive home, as well as an airplane and a mountain cabin. He was &amp;quot;short and slight, heavily pockmarked, and spoke with a severe stutter. [The FBI profiler] surmised that he had had severe skin problems as a teenager and, between that and the speech impediment, was probably teased or shunned by his [childhood] peers, particularly girls. So his self-esteem would have been low. That might have [explained] why he moved to Alaska [from Iowa, when he was 25] &amp;#151;the idea of a new start in a new frontier.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hansen was also a &amp;quot;proficient hunter&amp;quot; with a &amp;quot;well-outfitted trophy room where he watched television, full of animal heads, walrus tusks, horns and antlers, mounted birds, and skins on the floor.&amp;quot; Under attic floorboards was another &amp;quot;trophy room&amp;quot;: a hunting rifle matching bullets that had killed four prostitutes, as well as &amp;quot;various items of cheap jewelry belonging to the victims&amp;#133;a drivers license and other ID cards from some of the dead women&amp;#133;[and] an aviation map marked with where he had left various bodies.&amp;quot; Other jewelry &amp;quot;trophies&amp;quot; he had given to his wife and daughter.{{ref|Douglas1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

==John O'Brien==

&lt;p&gt;Two murder/suicides strangely echoed each other. In 1993, John O'Brien asked members of his stuttering self-help group where the heart is located in a person's chest. The next day he brought a handgun to the New York subway equipment facility where he worked. He shot a co-worker in the head, killing him instantly, and then shot his supervisor in the chest, leg, abdomen, and back. The supervisor lived. O'Brien then killed himself with a shot to his heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O'Brien stuttered severely. He had been denied a promotion because of his speech, but co-workers didn't know whether his victims had ridiculed him. Friends described O'Brien as &amp;quot;an unbelievably nice guy,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;quiet,&amp;quot; who &amp;quot;never bothered anyone.&amp;quot;{{ref|Laboy1993}}&lt;/p&gt;

==Pierre Lebrun==

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, Pierre Lebrun brought a high-powered hunting rifle to the Ottawa, Canada, city bus transit complex machine shop where he worked. He killed four co-workers and then killed himself. A suicide note listed many more co-workers that he disliked, and his pockets were full of live ammunition, leading police to speculate that his gun jammed and prevented more killings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lebrun stuttered mildly. Lebrun's mother reported, &amp;quot;He said a group of people were harassing him&amp;#151;not only one person, but a group of people. That's why he killed, that's why he went there&amp;#151;to kill the people who harassed him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lebrun's cousin recalled teasing in school. &amp;quot;That was the only thing that bothered him. It didn't bother him that he had the stutter; it bothered him that people would bug him about it.&amp;quot;{{ref|OC1999}} Lebrun had completed a four-month speech therapy program two years earlier. He was described as &amp;quot;a really nice guy,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;friendly,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;quiet and well-mannered.&amp;quot;{{ref|Reuters1999}}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuttering is one of the few disorders that generally gets better over time. Most children who stutter outgrow it. Even adults who stutter severely in their teens and 20s often overcome stuttering&amp;#151;via speech therapy or on their own&amp;#151;in their 30s or 40s. At the life stage when other people experience the dreams of their youth crashing down, stutterers realize they can accomplish anything they want, regardless of their speech. Stutterers are less likely to be famous in their youth, and more likely to be famous five hundred years later.&lt;/p&gt;

===Moses, Israelite Leader===

&lt;p&gt;Or five thousand years later. [[w:Moses|Moses]] stuttered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Moses said to the Lord, &amp;quot;Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either heretofore or since thou hast spoken to thy servant; but I am slow of speech and of tongue.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the Lord said to him, &amp;quot;Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Or who gives sight to one and makes another blind? Is it not I, the Lord? Now, therefore go, and I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall speak.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he said, &amp;quot;Oh, my Lord, send, I pray, some other person.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses and he said, &amp;quot;Is there not Aaron, your brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well; and behold, he is coming out to meet you, when he sees you he will be glad in his heart. And you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do. He shall speak for you to the people; and he shall be a mouth for you, and he shall be to him as God.&amp;quot; (Exodus 4:10-17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Aesop, Master Storyteller===

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Aesop|Aesop]] (620 to 560 BC) was born a slave and &amp;quot;most deformed&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;he coulde not speke.&amp;quot; One day he fell asleep under a shady tree. The Goddess of Hospitality appeared to him in a dream and gave him the gift of speech. His life changed and he became a master storyteller.{{ref|Bobrick1995}}

===Demosthenes, Orator===

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Demosthenes|Demosthenes]] (384 BC&amp;#8211;322 BC) was the greatest orator of ancient Greece. He overcame stuttering by speaking with pebbles in his mouth to improve articulation, shouting above the ocean waves to improve his volume, and working with an actor in reciting Sophocles and Euripedes to coordinate his voice and gestures.{{ref|Bobrick1995}}&lt;/p&gt;

===Virgil, Poet===

&lt;p&gt;Publius Vergilius Maro (70 BC-19 BC), known in English as [[w:Virgil|Virgil]], was a Roman poet. His works included the &lt;i&gt;Eclogues&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;Georgics&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;The Aeneid&lt;/i&gt;, the latter becoming the Roman Empire's national epic poem.&lt;/p&gt;

===Claudius, Emperor===

&lt;p&gt;Tiberius [[w:Claudius|Claudius]] Caesar Augustus Germanicus (10 BC-AD 54), was the Roman Emperor from AD 41 to AD 54. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claudius stuttered severely and was said to have weak hands and knees, although he was a tall, well-built man with no physical disability. His symptoms diminished after he became emperor. Claudius said that he'd exaggerated his weaknesses to avoid being murdered. By appearing to be weak and disabled, Claudius survived the deaths of all other rivals to the throne. He then served as one of the most effective and able emperors of Rome, for thirteen years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claudius' life was portrayed in Robert Graves' novel ''I, Claudius'' (1934). &lt;/p&gt;

===Dekanawida, The Great Peacemaker===

&lt;p&gt;[[w:Deganawida|Dekanawida]] invented representative government. He united the [[w:Iroquois|Iroquois]] nation in what is now New York state. This was in the sixteenth century, before the Iroquois encountered Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dekanawida's ideas influenced English philosophers, as well as [[w:Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin]]. The Iroquois model of representative government inspired the Americans and French to create representative democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The League of the Five Nations of the Iroquois was established, according to eighteenth-century sources, in the late sixteenth century. Iroquois tradition tells of constant warfare&amp;#133;One bereaved by this warfare was a Mohawk man, [[w:Hiawatha|Hiawatha]] (&amp;quot;He Who Makes Rivers&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crazed by grief for his murdered family, Hiawatha fled into the forests, living like a cannibal monster in the Iroquois myths. One day, Hiawatha met Dekanawida. The charismatic goodness of this man, said to have been a Huron miraculously born of a virgin, reawakened in Hiawatha his humanity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dekanawida confided to Hiawatha plans to free their peoples from the horrors of war by allying all the Iroquois in a grand league, a longhouse&amp;#133;in which [the leader of] each Iroquois nation would sit as a brother with brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visionary felt himself unequal to the task of forming the league because he suffered a speech impediment. Hiawatha, however, was an imposing man with a fluent tongue. Together, in the time-honored fashion of a wise leader who relies on his executive assistant to make his speeches (as among the Cherokee and Creek), Dekanawida and Hiawatha might be effective in restoring sanity and peace to their nations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiawatha was inspired. Tirelessly, the two men traveled up and down the land&amp;#133;Hiawatha fervently preaching the alliance outlined by Dekanawida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Iroquois were at first hesitant to trust a plan that contained their enemies. Thadodaho, an Onondaga leader, relentlessly opposed Hiawatha. In a dramatic showdown, Hiawatha's superior spiritual power overcame the evil Thadodaho. Hiawatha combed out of Thadodaho's hair the snakes that had marked him as a fearful sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the five nations&amp;#151;Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca&amp;#151;came together, fifty great chiefs meeting in a grand council at the principal town, in the center of the alliance territory.{{ref|Kehoe1992}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these men and women found a way to overcome stuttering, and this became the basis of his or her success. For each, their disability became their strength&amp;#151;and perhaps each looks back and sees stuttering as a gift.&lt;/p&gt;

{{SAMPLE|sampletext=
&quot;To understand is to perceive patterns&quot;|caption=—[[w:Isaiah Berlin|Isaiah Berlin]]}}

Software design patterns are abstractions that help structure system designs. While not new, since the concept was already described by [[w:Christopher Alexander|Christopher Alexander]] in its architectural theories, it only gathered some traction in programming due to the publication of [[w:Design Patterns|Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software]] book in October 1994 by [[w:Erich Gamma|Erich Gamma]], [[w:Richard Helm|Richard Helm]], [[w:Ralph Johnson|Ralph Johnson]] and [[w:John Vlissides|John Vlissides]], known as the '''Gang of Four (GoF)''', that identifies and describes 23 classic software design patterns. 

A design pattern is neither a static solution, nor is it an algorithm. A '''pattern''' is a way to describe and address by name (mostly a simplistic description of its goal), a repeatable solution or approach to a common design problem, that is, a common way to solve a generic problem (how generic or complex, depends on how restricted the target goal is). Patterns can emerge on their own or by design. This is why design patterns are useful as an abstraction over the implementation and a help at design stage. With this concept, an easier way to facilitate communication over a design choice as normalization technique is given so that every person can share the design concept.

Depending on the design problem they address, design patterns can be classified in different categories, of which the main categories are:
*[[C++ Programming/Code/Design Patterns/Creational Patterns|Creational Patterns]]
*[[C++ Programming/Code/Design Patterns/Structural Patterns|Structural Patterns]]
*[[C++ Programming/Code/Design Patterns/Behavioral Patterns|Behavioral Patterns]]. 

Patterns are commonly found in objected-oriented programming languages like C++ or Java. They can be seen as a template for how to solve a problem that occurs in many different situations or applications. It is not code reuse, as it usually does not specify code, but code can be easily created from a design pattern. Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. 

Each design pattern consists of the following parts:

; Problem/requirement : To use a design pattern, we need to go through a mini analysis design that may be coded to test out the solution.  This section states the requirements of the problem we want to solve. This is usually a common problem that will occur in more than one application.

; Forces : This section states the technological boundaries, that helps and guides the creation of the solution.

; Solution : This section describes how to write the code to solve the above problem. This is the design part of the design pattern. It may contain class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and or whatever is needed to describe how to code the solution.

Design patterns can be considered as a standardization of commonly agreed best practices to solve specific design problems. One should understand them as a way to implement good design patterns within applications. Doing so will reduce the use of inefficient and obscure solutions{{Citation needed}}. Using design patterns speeds up your design and helps to communicate it to other programmers{{Citation needed}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Isnt this wierd!!

I have been having this debate with a friend for 3 years and we are both Italian.....However, my friend believes that Amatriciana sauce has cream in it????. Basically, the traditional Carbonara does not have garlic or cream EEW! and yes, the quantities of the ingredients would vary from restaurants in Italy and New York... It is important for the recipe to stay as traditional as possible; otherwise, we may as well call it something else. 
I had an Italian restaurant in London which was very popular, cooking only traditional recipies from the motherland. Each to their own... I do not agree that because you are of Italian decent living in another country that you would not know more than an Italian from Italy...quite an absurd thought. In fact, my friend was born in Italy and knows squat about traditionality; in fact, she claims that Amatriciana has cream in it and that Carbonara has 1 egg for 4 people very strange sticky lump. I was born in the UK and pride myself on my Italian heritage. I find it insulting that individuals would not consider us &quot;true Italians&quot;.. Live on the International Italian!!


==Not the Italian recipe==
The [http://it.wikibooks.org/wiki/Libro_di_cucina/Ricette/Spaghetti_alla_carbonara Italian recipe] does not include '''any''' garlic or onion. Italians are not as keen on these two ingredients as the stereotype would have you believe. Ask any Italian&amp;mdash;that is, an Italian raised in Italy, not an &quot;Italian&quot;. [[User:83.67.217.254|83.67.217.254]] 09:54, 1 January 2006 (UTC)

*Just because there are ingredients here that wouldn't be used in Italy, doesn't mean that the ingredient is wrong.

::What do you mean by &quot;wrong ingredient&quot;? It's the recipe that is wrong. It's completely different from the original, so we need a different name. I propose we call this recipe &quot;Spaghetti con pezzi di maiale e tanto aglio e cipolla per incontrare il gusto burino degli anglosassoni a cui piacciono tanto le cose che sembrano italiane perche' fanno figo, ma che purtroppo non capiscono una mazza di gastronomia, poveretti&quot;. Just don't call it &quot;Spaghetti alla Carbonara&quot; please.

:::Show off!  Anyway, I'm the one who removed the old recipe a few months ago and started this one.  The garlic was added by someone else - I just removed it because we all agree it doesn't belong.  As for the onion, Rocco's in NYC uses onions, so I put that in.  Lastly, as someone who lived in Rome for 2 years, it strikes me as funny that so many Italian-Americans believe that there is ONE way to cook certain meals: &quot;That's not the way it's done!&quot;  If you have Spaghetti alla Carbonara in 10 different restaurants in Rome, you'll have 10 different versions!

:::: ...none of which with onion, I think you'll find. Rocco's in NYC needs to sell his rubbish to New Yorkers, so no surprises there. I agree with you that Italian-Americans have no authority to talk about Italian (note, no &quot;American&quot; here) cuisine. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:83.67.217.254|83.67.217.254]] ([[User talk:83.67.217.254|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/83.67.217.254|contribs]]) 2007-02-09T09:58:19.&lt;/small&gt;

==Definitely NOT the Italian Recipe==
Spaghetti alla Carbonara does not contain onions or garlic. I don't think I've ever heard of these two ingredients being added. Anyway, I pulled a few references (haven't properly annotated these) from my library, that have the correct recipe in them, which should definitely sway the argument:

Larousse Gastronomique - One of THE international cooking encyclopedias, every chef has one!

Leith's Cookery Bible - A very well respected English cook book and used in cooking schools.

Yum by Terry Durack - One of the great modern restaurant critics and food writers (Now based in London and, incidentally, married to Jill Dupleix).

I would like to modify this page next weekend?

--[[User:Tanzburg|Tanzburg]] 02:41, 28 January 2006 (UTC)[[User: Tanzburg]]

Furthermore, the Pancetta recommended here is also a substitute.  Guanciale, cured pork jaw fat, is the original fat used in the recipe and is far superior to Pancetta or, god forbid, bacon.  I also concur with the above comment that onion and or garlic are not used in traditional carbonara.  If you like it, by all means add it, but it isn't in the original.

The authentic dish is a simple mix of rendered Gualciale, Pasta, Parmigiana Reggiano, eggs, and coursley ground pepper, nothing more.

*Interesting that you should chose a French and an English cookbook to justify the perfect recipe for this dish [[User:Peterkirchem|Peterkirchem]] ([[User talk:Peterkirchem|talk]]) 16:56, 5 April 2008 (UTC)

== A few more tidbits ==

I agree! I was born and raised in Rome and the recipe certainly does not call for garlic. That would be sacrilegious. Onions I have seen, and I have even used them myself once or twice. Only, is about 1/8 of a small onion in order to make a small &quot;soffritto&quot;. It should be so little onion as to be impossible to find in the final product. 

As for the name, there is another possible provenance: &quot;La Carboneria&quot; was a secrect sect in the 1800's (I hope I am right. Please correct me on that -- a long time ago, in any case), whose members were called Carbonari. Also, a coal miner in Italian is a &quot;Minatore&quot;; a &quot;Carbonaro&quot; is the coal delivery man. Maybe someone should correct the wiki about that. This one I am positive.

Interestingly, I prefer substituting American bacon for the Guanciale instead of using pancetta. The original recipe does not use pancetta at all, while bacon actually has a history of being used for Carbonara in Rome, by Italians. After the liberation of Italy by the allies in WW2, guanciale was hard to come by, but the allies food rations had plenty of bacon and eggs to make carbonara with. Some even venture to say that carbonara in its present form was not around before 1944. I have got to find that out.

Remark of a chef: If you stand for the traditional recipe, at least stop mentioning parmigiano reggiano! The original recipe requires pecorino romano. Onions don't belong in carbonara, however, garlic is a good choice. Instead of sauteeing the garlic, you can just add it into the oil while heating it for giving it flavor and then remove it.

== The Point of view of a Roman ==
I am Roman (sorry for my English), so maybe I can contribute to bring some light about this recipe. 

First, in central Italy, there are no coal mines, but charcoal was produced there, and the ''Carbonari'', were men who went to the mountains and made charcoal out of wood. So, this is the origin of the name, which has nothing to do with the ''Carboneria'', which, as written above, was a sect active in the nineteenth century.

And now, something about the recipe.

Onion and/or Garlic are definitely NOT part of Carbonara;

The original recipe of Carbonara uses (incredible but true, read below the reason) Pancetta (bacon), NOT Guanciale;

Carbonara was unknown in Rome before WWII. I am positive about that, since I asked my mother (born in 1927), and she told me that the dish became popular after the war. Someone says that it was invented during the Allied Landing in Anzio and Nettuno, and this explains the reason why Bacon is used here, and not Guanciale (as in the Matriciana). Bacon was brought to Rome by the American soldiers who conquered the city in June 1944.

Moreover, there is no trace of Carbonara in the classical Book ''La Cucina Romana'', written by Ada Boni and published in 1927. 
So, I definitely think that Carbonara is an Italo-American invention occurred somewhere around Rome in 1944.

Finally, one last word about the method for finding the ''truth'' about a recipe. It is true that many cooks interpret every recipe differently. These are known by us as ''Variazioni sul tema''.
But it is also true that each recipe has a classical interpretation. How is it possible to find it? The only possibility, at least for someone who does not live where the dish was born, or, in this case, does not have a Roman mother or grandmother, is to look on the Classics. And, concerning the modern Roman cooking, the Bible is for sure the book of Ada Boni (unfortunately with the notable exception of Carbonara).

==charburners and miners==
are charburners different than miners? eh? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 19:47, 9 July 2005 (UTC)

Who knows?  Anyway, this is my favorite Pasta.  It is very Roman - which makes it unusual for Americans, who are used to a red tomato sauce from Southern Italy or a pesto sauce from Genoa.  Central Italian cuisine is great, and usually a bit spicy. {{user|67.80.139.189}}

==new version==
Note that 67.80.139.189 replaced the recipe on October 15, 2005. I think the new one is more usable, but I'm not really sure. The new one has:
*amount of pepper specified
*amount of salt '''un'''specified
*spaghetti is exactly 1 package, not 1.32 packages (much, much better)
*was 4 eggs, now 4 egg yolks (eeew, gross)
*water removed... uhhh... crunchy! (should be about 4 quarts I think)
*lots of onions and parsely added (yuck)
*per-serving, double the bacon (good idea)
*almost double the cheese, and of a different type
See if [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Cookbook:Spaghetti_alla_Carbonara&amp;oldid=244399 old recipe] if you like. Perhaps it should get a page to itself.
[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:01, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

Hey, I'm the guy who revised the recipe.  I just wanted to respond to the previous writer about my changes.
* The amount of salt is really up to the individual's taste (and health if you're trying to keep your blood pressure down).  I prefer a lot of salt in the water.
* The use of egg yolks only improves the flavor greatly - trust me!
* The water is drained, but you add some to the egg mixture and some again at the end (about 1/4 of a cup each time).
* The onions add some flavor to the meat, but I guess you could go without them.
* The parsley is just an extra flavor too, so I guess you could cut that out.
* The type of cheese should be parmiggiano-reggiano, but that's twice as expensive as regular parmiggiano, and the flavor is almost the same.
{{user|67.80.139.189}}

You can use four tilde (&quot;~&quot;) characters in a row to have the system automatically add your name and date. It won't otherwise. (I added it for you above) Normally we don't manually number things; it would be way too tedious to maintain. Sometimes people indent using a colon (&quot;:&quot;) to indicate a response, two colons for responses to that, and so on. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:54, 16 October 2005 (UTC)

== Using more simple words or adding synonyms so all people can understand ==

I got this message from Kellen:
&quot;(revert &quot;synonym: tool&quot; ... knowing what a &quot;utensil&quot; is is a pretty fundamental thing. If somebody wants to look it up, they can go to &quot;Cookbook:Utensil)

:All right , but why not make the word then point to &quot;Cookbook:Utensil&quot;? I'll do it, and I guess there is no more problems associated with this new action of mine. [[User:Logictheo|Logictheo]] 11:36, 14 November 2006 (UTC)


== More grist to the Carbonara ==

WOW !! Some discussion here. Has anyone seen MY recipe for Carbonara ?? It's here -

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Carbonara_pasta_sauce

Has anyone tried adding a dash of Strega to the Carbonara mixture just before adding the pasta ? Mmmm. Delicious

By the way, the REAL origin of Carbonara is that it was invented after the Anzio landings Italy in 1944 by the English Army Colonel and renowned gourmet, Jack Carbon, during the latter part of the Occupation of Italy by the Germans, as a diplomatic gesture to their Italians hosts, when the English wanted eggs and bacon for breakfast. It certainly wasn't invented by an American.... they wouldn't have the imagination.

== recipe summary ==

There is something wrong with the recipesummery template. The article is placed (because of that template) in the &quot;recipes with images&quot; category but there is no image. I don't know enough about that template to fix it.


== The Point of view of a Roman makes a good point ==

There is no such thing as a definitive recipe for this, and most other, pasta sauces. They have evolved over the years as they have become internationalised. The Italians of all people are wonderfully inventive, and patient in their acceptance of other people's interpretation of an Italian recipe. So let's not all get thrapped about this... add onions, or don't....add garlic, or don't... you know, no one will ever know what you did... and, for certain, no one will ever care.

= Hayes-compatible AT&amp; Commands =

This module provides a reference to the Hayes-compatible AT commands which start with an ''&amp;''. The following list '''only''' contains the original Hayes commands. Different modems use slightly different commands. However, this list is supposed to be as &quot;generic&quot; as possible, and should not be extended with modem-specific commands. Instead it is recommended to provide such command lists in an Appendix.

AT&amp; commands are in no way special, compared to other AT commands. It is just that Hayes at some point ran out of the 26 single-letter commands (ATA ... ATZ), so they introduced double-character commands. In order to avoid that these clash with single-letter commands, these double-character commands got a common prefix, the ''&amp;''.

=== &amp;C: Data Carrier Detect Options ===

'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;AT&amp;C[0|1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

This option controls the behaviour of the DCD (Data Carrier Detect, alias RLSD) RS-232 output line of the modem. The modem can either be told to keep the line always on (parameter 0), or that the line should really follow the state of the carrier on the phone line (parameter 1, default). The carrier on the phone line is the basic signal on which then (later) the data is modulated on. It is like the carrier frequency of some radio station. Carrier detection indicates if the two paired modems have been &quot;tuned in&quot;.

In case the RS-232 DCD line is configured to be driven by the modem following the state of the carrier (parameter 1), the DTE can use this information for flow control, display progress information to the user, etc.

On the other side, setting DCD to be on all the time (parameter 0) can be used if the DTE software, e.g. some terminal program, does not handle DCD correctly, or if the DTE ignores it. However, letting DCD follow the carrier state is usually the better configuration.

; AT&amp;C
or
; AT&amp;C0 : Always keep DCD on.
; AT&amp;C1 : DCD follows carrier state (default).

=== &amp;D: Data Terminal Ready Options ===

'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;AT&amp;D[0|1|2|3]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

The ''&amp;D'' command specifies how the modem should react to an on-to-off transition on its DTR (data terminal ready) input line. The DTE can use this line as part of some hardware-handshake. The exact behavior of the ''&amp;D'' command depends on other settings,  as outlined below:

! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | Description
|-

|-
| 1 || 0, 1, 4, 5, or 6 || A DTR on-off transition is interpreted as if the asynch. escape sequence has been entered. The modem goes in command mode but keeps the connection.
|-
| 1 || 2, or 3 || When the DTE drops DTR (on-off transition) the modem hangs up. Auto-answer is blocked.
|-
| 2 || 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 || When the DTE drops DTR (on-off transition) the modem hangs up. Auto-answer is blocked. This is the default setting.
|-
| 3 || 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 || A DTR on-off transition causes the modem to perform a soft-reset as if the Z command was received. The &amp;Y setting determines which configuration profile the modem will load during the reset.
|-
| 3 || 2, or 3 || When the DTE drops DTR (on-off transition) the modem hangs up. Auto-answer is blocked.
|}

Typically, more special rules apply if the modem supports additional features like Fax. This is out of the scope of this generic Hayes command description.

{{Stub}} ''Command Description Template''

'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;AT&amp;F[0|1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

The modem loads the factory profile 0 (default) or the factory profile 1. The factory profiles are fixed modem condigurations as provided by the modem manufacturer

=== &amp;G: Guard Tone Selection ===

'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;AT&amp;G[0|1|2&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

In some telephone systems it is necessary to transmit an additional ''guard tone'' in order to disable echo supressors in the phone system. Echo supressors do interfere with data communication, because they alter (in good faith) the transmited signal, e.g. by changing the signal's delay, phase and amplitude. This disturbes the modem's signal modulation and introduces communication errors.

A guard tone tells an echo supressor (and possibly other equipment) to not alter the transmitted signal. Guard tones are standardised in telecom standards.

; 0 : Do not use a guard tone (default)
; 1 : Set guard tone on answering modem to 550Hz. Note, this feature is rarely implemented in todays consumer modems.
; 2 : Use 1800Hz guard tone.

=== &amp;J: Jack Type Selection (Auxiliary Relay Options) ===

'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;AT&amp;J[0|1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

Hayes modems supported different jacks to connect the modem to a telephone or leased line. The '&amp;J' command allows to select the type of jack which should be used. Typically, this command is not fully implemented in today's modems. Usually, the command just sets some registers and does nothing otherwise.

; 0 : Jack type RJ-11, RJ41S, or RJ-45S type phone jack (default) 
; 1 : Jack type RJ-12 or RJ-13 type phone jack

=== &amp;Zn=x: Store Telephone Number ===

'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;Z[0|1|2|3]=&lt;x&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

The &lt;code&gt;&amp;Z&lt;/code&gt; command allows to store up to four telephone number dial strings into the modem's NVRAM. 

This feature is rarely used by modem communication software these days. DTE software preferes to keep an own list of possible phone numbers (e.g. a list of bulletin board system numbers), which can be much more than just four different numbers.

The feature is still useful in automated systems, and e.g. in cases where the DTE software is not (end user) configurable. For example, some embedded controller might be capable of running a modem communication with generic Hayes-compatible commands to allert a remote site in case of problems (burgler alarm, machine maintenance request, etc.). But for cost or other reasons the embedded system might provide no way for the end user to configure the embedded system. Instead the embedded system will use ATDS=0 (or another index) to dial and relie on the modem's setup to have a phone number stored at index 0 (or another index).

; n = 0 ... 3 : Index of the dial string
; &lt;x&gt; : A dial string. This can be a simple number, but it can also contain dial modifiers as listed for the ATD (dial) command. Typically, the size of a single dial string can not extend 34 characters.

{{Example|To store the number 00155512345 into register 0 for tone dialing (&lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;) use:

AT&amp;Z0&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;T00155512345&lt;CR&gt;

== Special Commands and Character Sequences ==

This module explains the special commands and character sequences as used by a &quot;generic&quot; Hayes-compatible modem. Different modems use slightly different commands. However, this list is supposed to be as &quot;generic&quot; as possible, and should not be extended with modem-specific commands. Instead it is recommended to provide such command lists in an Appendix.
 
==== AT: Command Prefix ====
'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;AT&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;command ...&gt;''&lt;CR&gt;

'''Description:'''

Almost every line with commands start with the &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt; prefix, followed by one or more commands, terminated with a Carriage Return character. 

See the [[#AT Command Format]] section for details.

==== &lt;CR&gt;: End-of-line Character ====
'''Syntax:'''

 ''AT command line''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

In command mode the end of line character (default ASCII 13, alias ASCII 0dH, alias &lt;CR&gt;, alias &lt;Ctrl-M&gt;, alias carriage return) marks the end of a command line. The modem starts to execute the command line after reception of the end-of-line character.

==== &lt;CAN&gt;: Cancel Character ====
'''Syntax:'''

 ''AT command line''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;CAN&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

In command mode the cancel character (default ASCII 24, aka ASCII 18H, aka &lt;CAN&gt;, aka &lt;Ctrl-X&gt;) cancels a command line as long as the command line has not been terminated with the [[#&lt;CR&gt;: End-of-line Character]].

|}

'''Related Commands and Registers:'''
* [[#AT Command Format]]
* [[#&lt;BS&gt;: Backspace Character]]

==== A/: Repeat Last Command ====

'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;A/&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

The command repeats the last command. It differs from other commands in two ways:

# It is ''not'' prefixed with the &lt;code&gt;AT&lt;/code&gt; command.
# It should not be followed by the usual &lt;code&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:

The most typical usage is to repeat a previous dialing command that failed because of a &lt;code&gt;BUSY&lt;/code&gt; line.

== AT Commands A - M ==

This module explains the AT commands A to M as used by a &quot;generic&quot; Hayes-compatible modem. Different modems use slightly different commands. However, this list is supposed to be as &quot;generic&quot; as possible, and should not be extended with modem-specific commands. Instead it is recommended to provide such command lists in an Appendix.

=== A: Answer Command ===
'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;A&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

The command initiates handshake as answering side. No next commands in this command line are proceeded. If handshake succeeds, modem sends successful message (&quot;CONNECT...&quot;) to serial line and serial line switches to data mode, otherwise failure message is sent and serial line remains in command mode.

'''Result Codes:'''

! style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | Description
|-
| CONNECT      || Handshaking succeeds
|-
| NO CARRIER   || Handshake failed
|}

CONNECT message usually contains speed, protocol and other details of succeeded connection and may be preceded with other messages of connection details.

* [[#S0: Register 0 - auto answer ring counter]]

=== B: Select Communication Standard ===
'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;B[0|1]    (original Hayes)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;B[number] (extensions)&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

In original Hayes modems, it selects protocols for 300bps and 1200bps handshake: B0 selects CCITT protocols; B1 selects Bell protocols.

Some vendors (e.g. Rockwell) extends it to limit connection speed (e.g. B15 - no more than 28800 bps).

* D: Dial
* +MS: Speed and protocol selection

=== C: Carrier Control Selection ===

'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;'''ATC0''' The carrier detect (CD) override is always on (default)&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;'''ATC1''' The modem sends the carrier detect signal when it makes connection
         with another modem and drops the signal when it disconnects.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

Controls the carrier detect signal sent by the modem to the computer. .

'''DTE Interface:'''

If AT&amp;C1, the carrier detect enters into a true state when a connection is made.
The carrier detect returns to a false state after the connection is dropped.

'''Aborting Events:'''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;None&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Related Commands and Registers:'''
*

=== D: Dial Command ===
'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;D [T|P|digits|misc]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

The command initiates dialing a number using pulse or tone dialing. The dial string can be rather flexible. Almost all of the modem's default settings can be overridden in the dial string. Dialing is controlled by providing dial modifiers after the &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; command.

'''Dial Modifiers:'''

; 0-9: Digits. This results in the corresponding DTMF tone being sent (tone dialing), or the corresponding number of pulses (pulse dialing) being sent.
; A-D, #, *: (Tone dialing only) Tone dialing supports six more characters, which can be dialed in addition to the numbers 0-9. However, these characters can trigger special functions in the telephone network and should only be used if their function is required in a particular network.
: NOTE, one of the nastiest things which can be triggered in some public networks with these characters is a test of the tariff time switch. The test consists of a rapid increase of the counter, which can end up at the phone bill as a huge debt.
; P: Pulse Dialing Modifier. Indicates that all following numbers should be dialed using puls dialing, until a &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; modifier is encountered. The modifier is persistent. It not only affects the current dialing, but also any other dialing (until a &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; modifier is encountered or the modem is reset).
; T: Tone Dialing Modifier. Indicates that all following numbers should be dialed using DTMF dialing, until a &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; modifier is encountered. The modifier is persistent. It not only affects the current dialing, but also any other dialing (until a &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; modifier is encountered or the modem is reset).
; W: Wait for Second Dial Tone. This is useful when working behind a PABX. Typically to dial out from behind a PABX it is first necessary to seize an external line by dialing a special number, and then waiting for the public line's dial tone before continuing.
; ,: Delay. The modem will pause for the delay configured in register S8 before continuing dialing. This is useful when dealing with old, slow mechanical telephone equipment, as well as working in special PABX configurations. Some PABX need some time to seize a line, but provide no progress indication when they have done so. Note, if a second dial tone is provided, then the &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt; modifier is a much better choice over the &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; modifier.
; @: Wait for Silence. This is another modifier which is helpful in dealing with special PABX configurations. The modem waits for at least five seconds of silence before continuing dialing. Silence is defined as no signal in the call progress indication frequency band, not as absolute silence (not as absence of line noise). 
: If the modem doesn't detect these five seconds of silence prior to the expiration of the S7 call abort timer, the modem stops the dialing (call abortion), and returns a &lt;code&gt;NO ANSWER&lt;/code&gt; result code. This is somewhat counter intuitive, since the modem is waiting for silence as an answer. If busy detection is enabled, some modems return a &lt;code&gt;BUSY&lt;/code&gt; answer code instead. Which is also arguable. 
: If an answer tone from some remote modem arrives while waiting for the five seconds of silence, the modem initiates the handshake procedure and aborts dialing. If the handshake succeeds the modem is on-line.
; !: Flash. A flash is a special signal send to some telephone equipment, like a phone exchange. The flash is send by (ab)using the hock. The modem goes on-hock for a specific time. That time is exchange-equipment / telecom-standard specific. It has to be shorter than the on-hock time which is interpreted by the exchange as call/dialing abortion. The flash time can be configured via the modem's S29 register. Some PABX require a flash if they are supposed to seize a public line.
; ;: Return to Command State after Dialing. This modifier indicates the end of the dialing, but instead of requesting the modem to go into the call progress state, the modem will return to the command line. This enables to send additional AT commands to the modem while the modem is still off-hock. These additional commands may be placed after the &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; on the same command line, or can also be send on additional command lines.
:To continue the call, an additional dial command, e.g. a single &lt;code&gt;ATD&lt;CR&gt;&lt;/code&gt; needs to be sent, which will transition the modem's state to enter call progress.
:Alternatively, the call can be aborted by sending the on-hock command &lt;code&gt;ATH0&lt;CR&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
; S=n: Dial Stored Telephone Number. Dial one of four (n = 0 ... 3) telephone dial strings. See the &lt;code&gt;&amp;Z&lt;/code&gt; command for how to store a number in the modem.
; R: Originate Call in Answer Mode. Originate the call, but behave as being called instead. The modem expects that handshake negotiation is reversed. This is often not implemented in today's modems, and the modifier is ignored.

Modern modems accept and support a number of additional modifiers.

{{TODO|todonote=Add an appendix with descriptions of typical, but not generic-hayes-compatible modifiers}}

=== E: Command State Character Echo Selection ===
'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;E[0|1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

Switches character echo on (1) or off (0) when in the command state. Given no argument, assumes 0.

Character echoing is usually not desired when controlling a modem via some software program. It is useful for debugging purposes, and when the modem is controlled manually, e.g. via some generic terminal program.

* ''&lt;Link list of related commands and registers&gt;''
=== H: Hook Command Options ===
'''Syntax:'''

 &lt;nowiki&gt;H[0|1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Description:'''

Controls if the modem goes on-hook (disconnects from the phone line), or off-hook (connects to the phone line). The wording is taken from normal telephone usage, where someone takes the handset off the hook (off-hook) when intending to place a call. The terminology is counter-intuitive for modems, since off-hook indicates the modem goes on-line, and on-hook indicates the modem goes off-line.

; H
or
; H0 : The modem will release the phone line (going on-hook) if the modem is currently on-line (off-hook). The command is also typically used to terminate a modem's self-test or automatic line test mode - if provided by a particular modem. The modem will go into command mode after the command. In order to issue the command while on-line, and while not in command mode, the escape code sequence need to be sent prior to the command, to force the modem in command mode first.

; H1 : If on-hook (off-line), the modem will go off-hook (on-line), and remain in command mode. Typically, the next command in command mode is a &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; dial command. If the inactivity timer S7 expires while off-hook, the modem goes back on-hook (off-line). This behavior prevents accidental blocking of a phone line by broken DTE software which manages to go off-hook but for whatever reason doesn't use the seized line.

== AT Commands N - Z ==

This module explains the AT commands N to Z as used by a &quot;generic&quot; Hayes-compatible modem. Different modems use slightly different commands. However, this list is supposed to be as &quot;generic&quot; as possible, and should not be extended with modem-specific commands. Instead it is recommended to provide such command lists in an Appendix.

=== N: Negotiation of Handshake Options ===

'''Syntax:'''

 N[0|1]

'''Description:'''

Controls whether during the handshake it is acceptable to fall back to a lower connection speed than specified by the S37 register. N0 indicates that fall back is not acceptable, N1 indicates that fall back is acceptable.

:

; X
or
; X0
: blind dial, no busy detect, CONNECT.
; X1
: blind dial, no busy detect, CONNECT xxxx.
; X2
: dial tone detect, no busy detect, CONNECT xxxx.
; X3
: blind dial, busy detect, CONNECT xxxx.
; X4
: full monitor, all messages, CONNECT xxxx.

where xxxx = DTE rate or DCE rate.

Note that the connect message response is a function of Wn, Xn and \Vn.

* Due to the split of the long AT command reference into separate modules many cross-references to AT command descriptions are now wrong on this and the new module pages

* The Result codes should also be moved to some own module.
